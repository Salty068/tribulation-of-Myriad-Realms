Chapter 749: The Fierce Lineage of the Torchbearers! (Seeking Subscriptions)

Even though it was just a conjecture, Su Yu took it seriously.

Whether it was a guess or the truth, his recent defeat might actually be a blessing in disguise. Before reaching the pinnacle, before the final battle, losing once might not be a bad thing!

Nowadays, everyone firmly believed in his invincibility.

Not considering the strength of his opponents or the possibility of traps might not be wise. At this point, there was no one left to help him fill in the gaps.

Although Su Yu was domineering and decisive, it didn't mean he couldn't accept some reminders.

Since the appearance of the Hundred Battle King, no one had given him any hints—neither the Great Zhou King, Wan Tiansheng, nor Lantian.

Su Yu didn't know if they hadn't thought of it or if they simply didn't care.

In any case, they were certain Su Yu would be fine!

In truth, Su Yu hadn't really considered these things before.

The appearances of Qirong and Jiang Hai had gradually given him more insight into the previous tides.

Even the third-generation Human Lord had left some contingencies for himself, let alone the most powerful ninth generation!

...

Ren Mountain.

At this moment, Ren Mountain was still somewhat chaotic, not yet reaching the point where no one could infiltrate.

It would take time to perfect the entire defense system of Ren Mountain.

Su Yu casually transformed into an Iron Devourer and easily blended into the third layer, entering the territory of the Iron Devourer Race.

Marquis Giant Bamboo was busy arranging matters. Upon receiving Su Yu's message, he quickly returned to the main hall. Seeing Su Yu transformed into an Iron Devourer again, he was speechless. "You keep disguising yourself. If you do it too much, and the myriad races notice, won't you be exposed?"

Su Yu looked at Marquis Giant Bamboo and, after a moment of silence, asked, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, let me ask you something. During the ninth tide, why didn't you help the Hundred Battle King?"

"…"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was silent for a long time before saying, "July died in battle, and the Hundred Battle King often pits his allies against each other. How could we dare to help him?"

"Then why did July participate in the battle in the first place?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo chuckled, "The Hundred Battle King was very strong, and the Human Race was very strong. At that time, the old relics of the Human Realm descended to assist in the battle. It was much stronger than the previous tides. It was a rare moment when the Human Race was united, with many veteran Daofuse cultivators descending... So, at that time, everyone thought the Hundred Battle King had a chance of victory... In fact, at the last moment, if the Hundred Battle King hadn't been schemed against, he indeed had a chance of victory!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo laughed, "You could say it was just bad luck. Otherwise, if the Hundred Battle King hadn't been schemed against and had won, the Iron Devourer Race would have been a joke! We couldn't even latch onto the Hundred Battle King's coattails."

Su Yu nodded slightly and asked again, "From an observer's perspective, what do you think of the Hundred Battle King?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was puzzled. Why was Su Yu bringing up this person repeatedly today?

After some thought, he cautiously replied, "Unmatched in battle prowess, exceptionally talented! He is considered loyal and righteous... but only towards the Human Race, not towards his allies."

Loyal and righteous!

The Great Zhou King had also mentioned several times that the Hundred Battle King was a loyal and righteous person.

Yet, a loyal and righteous person, after seeing Marquis Zhennan self-destruct for him, went straight to find Moon Luo without even mentioning checking on Marquis Zhennan. Your subordinate sacrificed himself for you!

Do you not care at all?

Su Yu was silent for a while before suddenly asking, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, do you think there are any rulers of laws among the myriad races?"

"Ah?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was stunned for a moment. "No, right? Where would a ruler of laws come from? If there were, the Human Race would have been wiped out long ago..."

Su Yu frowned slightly. "Really none?"

"Probably not!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo shook his head. "I don't think so. Why does Emperor Yu have such an idea?"

Su Yu lightly tapped the table, not asking further.

He was still a bit puzzled now.

Why was the Hundred Battle King so sure that the myriad races could resist the Chaos Race?

That's the first point.

Secondly, did all those who died for the Hundred Battle King really perish?

A group of people made way for him, which was very touching.

But making way... does it have a benefit? The Hundred Battle King could become stronger, but could those who made way... switch paths?

Yes, switch paths!

Su Yu could allow people to switch paths. Could the Hundred Battle King do it?

Did he open the Heaven Gate?

If he did, he could also allow people to switch paths!

The old relics forced Yue Gang to kill his dao companion, but for the Hundred Battle King, they truly gave their all, even self-destructing to make way. The treatment between the third tide and the ninth tide Human Lords was vastly different!

"Switching paths... Daofuse..."

One thought after another emerged. The next moment, Su Yu released the skeleton Qirong.

Qirong, now slightly more robust, was no longer skin and bones. She had a bit more blood color, but still looked quite ghastly.

As soon as Qirong appeared, she looked at Su Yu with some confusion.

Su Yu asked solemnly, "Consort Qi, let me ask you something. Can true paths be converted..."

Fearing he wasn't clear, Su Yu added, "That is, while cultivating the physical path, can one also cultivate another path, then create the illusion of a broken path, sever the physical path, and create the appearance of falling? Is it possible?"

Su Yu believed it was possible, but he hadn't tried it.

Qirong had studied this for many years and might have experience.

Qirong fell into thought and, after a moment, said, "It should be possible, but it's not easy. Since the Human Lord has opened the Heaven Gate, it should be doable."

"Opening the Heaven Gate makes it possible?"

"It should."

Qirong nodded. "Since the Heaven Gate is open, you can see the essence of the Great Dao. It shouldn't be too difficult to do. Stepping into two paths, severing one, is also a form of Great Dao fracture, a collapse of the Dao rules!"

"In the Lower Realm, it might be a bit difficult. In the Upper Realm, severing the Dao rules would indeed appear as a fall!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he suddenly looked at Marquis Giant Bamboo. "Those old relics who died for the Hundred Battle King, did they die in the Upper Realm or the Lower Realm?"

Does this matter?

Marquis Giant Bamboo thought, recalling Su Yu's earlier words, his eyes flickered slightly. "Some were in the Upper Realm, some in the Lower Realm. Back then, communication between the Upper and Lower Realms wasn't cut off. Through the Fate Clan, messages could be passed!"

Su Yu stroked his chin and finally asked, "What do you know about the Ancient Giant Race, Marquis Giant Bamboo?"

"What?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was surprised. Why was he suddenly asking about the Ancient Giant Race?

Feeling a bit overwhelmed, he replied, "The Ancient Giant Race... is just the Ancient Giant Race, one of the dominant races of the ancient times. Why?"

"No, I mean, what was their relationship with the Human Race before?"

"It was okay, I guess!"

Su Yu nodded. "Then why, when most ally races were wiped out, was the Ancient Giant Race not implicated, not even targeted as much as the Iron Devourer Race?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo breathed a sigh of relief. So that's what he was asking.

He quickly said, "The Iron Devourer Race was a staunch ally, while during the ninth tide, the Ancient Giant Race actually besieged the Human Race! During that tide, they chose to oppose the Human Race..."

Su Yu remembered!

Yes!

Opposition!

That day, the Great Zhou King invited the Ancient Giant King to join the battle. The Ancient Giant King agreed and went. Later, Su Yu learned that the Ancient Giant Race had indeed participated in the ninth tide but stood against the Human Race.

But this didn't make sense!

If they participated, why were there descendants of the Hundred Battle King in the Ancient Giant Race?

And the Great Zhou King knew about it. Su Yu pondered, "Did you know about the Hundred Battle King's descendants in the Ancient Giant Race, Marquis Giant Bamboo?"

"How could I have known!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo smiled wryly. "I never imagined it. The Hundred Battle King, as I said, was friendly to the Human Race but indifferent to the myriad races. He had high aspirations and valued Human Race bloodlines... He wouldn't marry outside! The Ancient Giant Race... could it be that they believed the Ancient Giant Race had royal Human Race blood?"

He thought for a moment and said, "The Ancient Giant Race should be the race most similar to the Human Race. Apart from being ancient, they're just giants, a bit larger in size, but structurally almost identical to the Human Race! They should be the closest lineage to the Human Race in the Myriad Realms. And according to legend, it's said that the Ancient Giant Race is actually a lineage of the Human Ancestor. Of course, that's just a legend."

"A lineage of the Human Ancestor?"

Su Yu was stunned for a moment, suddenly looking at Qirong. Qirong, seeing Su Yu's gaze, was surprised but explained, "There is such a legend. It's said that the Human Ancestor is related to the beginning of the ancient era. The Human Ancestor was a dominant figure of the ancient era. And the Ancient Giant Race was also a dominant race of the ancient era. Some say the Human Ancestor was actually the Ancient Giant Emperor!"

She explained, "The Ancient Giant Race never had an emperor in any era. Even in the ancient times, they were without an emperor! In the ancient era, they only had the Ancient Giant King!"

Su Yu frowned. Yes.

The Ancient Giant Race never claimed an emperor!

Qirong continued, "But it's just a legend. After all, the Human Ancestor era was a long time ago! The longest-living being in the Myriad Realms now should be Hongmeng! But Hongmeng actually came after the opening of the heavens. Even if he lived during that time, the Human Ancestor was still around, and he was too weak, just a minor figure, so naturally, he wouldn't know about the Human Ancestor."

Hongmeng!

The oldest existence in the Myriad Realms, even the most ancient.

Unfortunately, he was too lazy, always sleeping.

Even if he wasn't asleep, he might not know about the early ancient times.

Too weak, unworthy of knowing.

One thought after another flashed. During the ninth tide, the Giant Race was actually opposed to the Human Race, yet this opposing race had descendants of the Hundred Battle King.

How did the Great Zhou King know?

The Great Zhou King made it sound simple, saying many knew, but among those Su Yu knew, it seemed no one knew, including Marquis Dingjun and others.

"The Great Zhou King?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered continuously. Did the Great Zhou King know something?

Was the extinction of the Torchbearer lineage real or fake?

In this world, how many people were truly worthy of his trust?

Who was using him?

And for whom was he fighting?

Countless thoughts flashed. There were no people of the Hundred Battle King in the Upper Realm. What about the Lower Realm?

The Ancient Giant Race... a mysterious race, seemingly powerful yet low-key. Even in the Upper Realm, when people think of allies for the Human Race, they first consider the Iron Devourer Race, then whether the Fate Clan will remain neutral or side with the Humans. Only lastly do they ponder the Ancient Giant Race.

"The bloodline of the Human Ancestor..."

Su Yu's thoughts raced. The Martial Emperor had said that the Human Ancestor pioneered the path of the physical body for the Human Race, and indeed, the Giant Race's physical prowess was formidable. Hundred Battle had also become a master of the physical body path! At least in the past hundred thousand years, he had ventured the furthest along this path.

Giant Race... Human Ancestor... Hundred Battle... physical body path...

Gradually, a line connected these thoughts!

It seemed they were all related!

At this moment, Marquis Giant Bamboo couldn't help but say, "It's just a legend. The Ancient Giant Race themselves have denied it, and the Human Race hasn't acknowledged it either..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Of course, how could they admit it? If the Human Ancestor were indeed the progenitor of the Ancient Giant Race, then they would be his descendants, and their status would surpass even the Human Emperor's. Strictly speaking, many powerful beings are descendants of the Human Ancestor. The path of the physical body was pioneered by him, making the Human Ancestor more representative and legitimate than the Human Emperor. This isn't something that can be casually acknowledged!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo shrugged, "Well, I don't quite understand the Human Race's thinking."

Su Yu smiled and said, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, since there are no outsiders today, why don't you let Consort Qi rest for a while?"

Consort Qi was speechless. He called me out, asked a few questions, and now wants me to go back in.

Fine!

She nodded, knowing Su Yu had more to say. She also needed to digest some of the speculations just discussed.

Soon, Su Yu put Consort Qi away and turned to Marquis Giant Bamboo, smiling, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, now it's just you and me. You're of the same generation as March, so I won't ask March. To be honest... if I were to lose the upcoming battle, would the Iron Devourer Race still follow me down this path?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo's heart stirred. He looked at Su Yu, his eyes flickering for a moment before he finally said, "What does Emperor Yu mean by losing... in what sense?"

He quickly added, "If it's a temporary defeat, my race won't change our minds! But if Emperor Yu were to die, or if there was no longer any hope of victory... then the Iron Devourer Race must consider the future of our race!"

Su Yu laughed, "The matters of the Lower Realm will eventually spread. How will you decide then?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo said solemnly, "The Lower Realm is the Lower Realm, and the Upper Realm is the Upper Realm! Although we are of the same race, it doesn't mean we share the same will! Otherwise, there wouldn't be the existence of half-emperors in the Lower Realm! Let me put it this way, the Lower Realm's Tiangu represents the Immortal Race! But the Upper Realm's Immortal Race, including Dao Heavenly Sovereign and others, do not represent the Lower Realm's Tiangu!"

"Strictly speaking... the Lower Realm is the orthodox!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo said solemnly, "You heard right, the Lower Realm is the orthodox! We old folks in the Upper Realm are merely here to leave a way out for our race. That's why we came to the Upper Realm back then! So, at critical moments, we can cut ties! To put it simply... it's a two-way investment!"

He said solemnly, "In the Upper Realm, I can stand with the myriad races, and in the Lower Realm, I can stand with the Human Race. This is the tacit rule, one race, two branches!"

This is also the way of survival!

Su Yu laughed, "So, at critical moments, you can abandon June and the others in the Lower Realm?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was silent for a moment, then nodded, "Yes! Everything... for the race!"

Su Yu sighed, "Then if I'm still alive and there's hope, you won't change your allegiance?"

"No."

Marquis Giant Bamboo said solemnly, "As long as Emperor Yu is here, we see hope..."

"What if I ask you to retreat from the Upper Realm with me?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo frowned.

Su Yu smiled, "Then don't retreat. What if I ask you to lie low and wait for my return?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo felt heavy-hearted, "Return?"

"Yes."

Marquis Giant Bamboo was a bit agitated, "Emperor Yu, the current situation is favorable. Not only have we forced out the Chaos Race, but we've also made the myriad races cooperate with us to attack the Chaos Race together. It's a thriving scene! Why... why say such things?"

"Anything is possible, isn't it?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was extremely heavy-hearted. After a long time, he nodded, "As long as Emperor Yu doesn't die, my race won't change course! Even if... it's Hundred Battle!"

Su Yu looked at him!

Marquis Giant Bamboo said solemnly, "Is there a problem with Hundred Battle's defeat? Is Emperor Yu asking about the Ancient Giant Race... is it related to this? In any case, Hundred Battle is not the good lord in our hearts! Maybe he is for the Human Race, but he is not for us outsiders!"

Su Yu laughed and nodded, "Alright, that's all for now! I won't say anything to March. Here... you all be careful! The Iron Devourer Race in the Lower Realm doesn't need your concern. As long as you're fine in the Upper Realm, help me plant a nail!"

"After I leave, consider yourselves part of the myriad races! Don't pay attention to anyone unless I come looking for you again... you are just the Iron Devourer Race in the myriad races' council!"

Heavy!

Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't know why Su Yu suddenly had such a change. Previously, Su Yu was full of confidence, ready to make a big move, but now, he seemed to have a tendency to retreat to the Lower Realm. Why?

Had he seen too many Heavenly Sovereigns and lost hope?

Or what?

"Emperor Yu... I... I remember your words!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo was a bit breathless, "I... I won't have any other thoughts unless I hear of Emperor Yu's complete demise! Because it was I who suggested killing the three Daofuse, and Emperor Yu showed me surprises and hope... I don't know about others, but Giant Bamboo will support Emperor Yu to the end!"

"Thank you!"

Su Yu laughed, stood up, and said, "Then I'll be off. I won't notify others. In the Upper Realm, I've mostly been in contact with you."

"Also, inform March and Destiny to reach the vicinity of Chaos Mountain as soon as possible! And have March find a way to send a message to Chaos Mountain, inviting Hundred Battle to return and discuss an alliance. It's already confirmed that the Chaos Race exists, so there's no need to pretend. It's not like the Chaos Race doesn't know! No matter what, Hundred Battle is a top-tier expert... just say we can help him unseal!"

Su Yu laughed, "Have March send out the message, or find a way to have Moon Heavenly Sovereign and the others send out the message. Even if it's a bluff, get Hundred Battle to come. If he doesn't come... then forget it!"

Unseal you, okay?

We're going to unseal you, and you still don't come... then you're really not in a hurry!

"Also, spread some news about sweeping the Source of the Dao, capturing several strong Human Race members, including Marquis Jiang Hai!"

Su Yu laughed, "This is the last thing I'm asking you to do, Marquis Giant Bamboo is a smart person, I hope you can help me accomplish it smoothly!"

"Rest assured!"

At this moment, Marquis Giant Bamboo had vaguely guessed something, nodded, and said seriously, "Soon, these things will be done! Hundred Battle will definitely receive the message, even if something is exposed, it doesn't matter, as long as we don't directly contact you, bringing Hundred Battle back won't make the myriad races say anything! At worst, I'll have March go to Chaos Mountain and shout, more directly!"

"Thank you!"

"Emperor Yu, no need to be polite, it's my duty!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo said, and Su Yu smiled, his figure dissipating, disappearing from the spot.

Marquis Giant Bamboo's face was solemn. After Su Yu left, he paced back and forth for a while.

Defeat, disappearance, retreat...

Is it good or bad?

He wasn't sure!

But he knew that Su Yu was not someone to be trifled with. Now, it seemed someone had provoked him, and this might not be a good thing.

"April!"

A low shout was heard, and soon, April appeared.

"Go, find March, tell him to return immediately..."

"My father is still sweeping the Upper Realm..."

"Tell him to put it on hold!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo said solemnly, "I'll give you a letter, hand it to March in person, quickly, I want to see March return immediately!"

"Alright!"

April saw the solemn expression on Marquis Giant Bamboo's face and didn't dare delay. After Marquis Giant Bamboo finished writing the letter, he quickly broke through the air, flying towards March and the others.

...

Inside Chaos Mountain.

After leaving the Iron Devourer Race, Su Yu went to other places to make arrangements, leaving some escape routes before returning to the inner area of Chaos Mountain.

This time, he might not leave through Soul Burying Mountain.

Su Yu had to prepare more.

And when Su Yu returned, just as he entered the hidden area, he heard a voice piercing through the heavens.

"Hundred Battle!"

"I am March!"

"The Myriad Races Council is willing to join hands with you to face the great enemy together! Do not pursue Moon Luo any further, beware of traps deep inside, return quickly, the Myriad Races Council is willing to unseal you! I, March, am willing to stake my life and race on it!"

"Hundred Battle, join forces, crush the Chaos lineage, and then the Human Race and the Myriad Races can compete again, decide victory or defeat, life or death!"

"......"

Roars echoed continuously, the grand voice reverberating for thousands of miles, shaking the Great Dao.

Throughout the chaotic land, beast roars echoed.

And March's voice continued to reverberate.

"Hundred Battle! Do not go deeper, there are traps!"

"Joining forces to kill the enemy is stronger than your lone strength!"

"If you want revenge, first exterminate the Chaos lineage!"

"The Torchbearer lineage is also willing to unseal you, I believe this lineage will contribute, if anyone from the Torchbearer lineage hears this, contact us quickly!"

"......"

The voice shook the heavens and earth, and Su Yu heard ancient beasts roaring nearby.

March seemed to have ventured deep into Chaos Mountain.

Very bold!

The power of the Great Dao trembled, sweeping across, and the chaotic aura of the entire Chaos Mountain surged towards that side, repelling March!

...

Inside the cave.

Su Yu listened silently.

March was taking action!

Could Hundred Battle hear it?

He could!

Su Yu was certain he could hear it, but if even at this point, Hundred Battle was unwilling to return, unwilling to appear... then there might really be a problem. Perhaps he was with Moon Luo, watching the show.

Inside the cave, others also heard it, feeling a bit strange.

Marquis Dingjun took a deep breath and said, "Joining forces with the Hundred Battle King? That's quite... quite an idea, but can the Myriad Races really unseal him?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Why not? There's hope. The sealing path of the Control King's lineage is strong, but the Myriad Races aren't weak either. There are experts skilled in this path. I think there's a chance to unseal the Hundred Battle King. Of course, if he's afraid of being betrayed by the Myriad Races, then forget it..."

Su Yu continued with a mocking smile, "But the Hundred Battle King is so foolish, the Myriad Races probably can't be bothered to kill him!"

Marquis Dingjun gave a dry laugh, while Lantian chuckled, "Not necessarily. The Hundred Battle King might worry about being tricked by the Myriad Races. He might just continue doing his own thing, not caring what they say!"

Su Yu laughed, "True, the Hundred Battle King is brainless. He might not even think that far! Maybe he thinks the Myriad Races want to kill him. If that's the case, then his brain really has some issues... How can someone like him cultivate to such a level... Heaven must be blind!"

Su Yu shook his head, and General Xuelan and the others frowned slightly. Xuelan interjected, "Lord Su, I didn't live through the era of the Hundred Battle King, but... there's no need to belittle him to elevate yourself!"

"No matter what, he was the Human Lord, a strong figure of the Human Race!"

Su Yu laughed, "Really? He was foolish, wasn't he? Can't I say that?"

Su Yu smiled, "It's a known fact that he's foolish! If you don't believe me, ask those who lived through his era..."

He looked at Marquis Yunshui and smiled, "Marquis Yunshui is gentle and speaks fairly. Marquis Yunshui, would you say the Hundred Battle King is foolish or not?"

Marquis Yunshui looked awkward and after a moment said, "The Hundred Battle King was somewhat impulsive and reckless, but beyond that... I can't say much."

Su Yu laughed, "See?"

He then turned to Shadow Marquis and asked, "Shadow, would you say the Hundred Battle King is foolish or not?"

Shadow Marquis's voice was hoarse, "This... Your Majesty, we... it's not our place to say. After all, the Hundred Battle King was the Human Lord."

Su Yu nodded and smiled, "True! Let's leave it at that! Everyone knows he's foolish. General Xuelan, I think we shouldn't waste more time on him!"

At this moment, those defending the Hundred Battle King might not necessarily be bad people. Did Xuelan know something?

And those not defending him might not necessarily be good people either. Perhaps they genuinely thought so, or maybe... they wanted others to think that way!

Su Yu smiled and quickly changed the topic, "Alright, enough nonsense! Great Ming King, how's the forging going?"

Previously, there were 18 people from the Upper Realm! Later, Jiuyue returned, along with Xuelan and four others, making a total of 23 top-tier experts! As for Xia Longwu and the others, they were still in the Mark of Civilization and hadn't come out. Su Yu wasn't planning to release Qirong either.

Among the 23 top-tier experts, there were 8 Heavenly Kings, 9 second-tier Daofuse, 4 third-tier Daofuse, and then Jiuyue and Heavendoom, both in the fourth-tier Daofuse Realm.

The Great Ming King quickly replied, "From the corpses of two ancient beasts, we've forged only 8 formation symbols. Previously, we forged 8, so there are only 16 formation symbols... we're still short by 7!"

Su Yu smiled, "No worries, we'll have them once we kill the enemy! Kill seven, and naturally, we'll have seven jade symbols! Lantian and I can do without for now, five will suffice... Besides, if a great battle truly erupts, whether we have jade symbols or not won't matter! At worst, the ancient beasts will besiege us, but the Control King's lineage will face the same siege... no fear!"

The Great Ming King laughed, "Since Your Majesty thinks it's fine, then the forging is complete!"

16 formation symbols!

Quickly, Su Yu distributed them.

Those who didn't receive any, Su Yu opened the Mark of Civilization and looked at Heavendoom and the others, smiling, "You all aren't strong enough, so hide in here for now to avoid being discovered. This time, we're going big!"

Reluctantly, Heavendoom and Grandstar were among them.

Heavendoom was initially displeased, but seeing Grandstar was also included, he laughed heartily, feeling satisfied!

If I'm too weak to receive one, neither are you!

Besides Su Yu and Lantian, five others didn't receive any: Grandstar, Heavendoom, Jiuyue, the Great Qin King, and the Great Xia King.

These two could somewhat avoid the ancient beasts' siege.

Everyone else, including Xuelan and the others, received one. Su Yu sternly said, "Everyone, I'll repeat once more: follow orders strictly. No matter the situation, when I give an order, even in battle, you must obey!"

"Understood!"

Everyone responded, though Xuelan and a few others were still a bit unaccustomed, they still said, "Lord Su, we will naturally comply with your orders."

Su Yu nodded, "That's best!"

Su Yu calmly said, "If I say fight to the death, then fight to the death! If I say retreat, then retreat! If I say self-destruct... then self-destruct! You can leave your sea of will, you don't have to die with your body, there's still a chance!"

Su Yu slowly said, "I hope everyone will listen to me, especially you, General Xuelan!"

Su Yu sternly said, "I fought my way from the Lower Realm to the Upper Realm, winning every battle! I don't want to lose because you don't follow orders! Losing often means death!"

Su Yu then looked at the Great Zhou King and said, "In this battle, luring out the enemy is the first priority, killing is the second, and third is making the Myriad Races think we've suffered heavy losses. Great Zhou King, at a critical moment, explode some divine characters to fake the fall of strong experts..."

The Great Zhou King smiled and nodded, "Rest assured, I'll handle it well!"

Su Yu half-jokingly said, "It's just fake death, don't really die!"

Then, he looked at Lantian, "Gather all your avatars, otherwise, if they're scattered, your strength will weaken!"

Lantian looked aggrieved, "What if I die in battle? Gathering them all is too dangerous."

Su Yu laughed, "How could that be! Don't you trust me? Stop talking nonsense, have I ever lost? Quickly, gather your avatars, or if your main body is killed, your avatars elsewhere will be exposed!"

"Alright then!"

Lantian reluctantly said, "Then I'll have to dig up the nails I buried. If I knew this, I wouldn't have buried them!"

The Great Zhou King also said, "Perhaps we should let Lantian leave some avatars in the Upper Realm to gather information."

Su Yu laughed, "No need! After this battle, we'll retreat to the second line! If Lantian's avatars aren't gathered, I feel his strength will drop significantly, it's unwise!"

The Great Zhou King hesitated but seeing Su Yu's insistence, he said no more.

Su Yu quickly assigned tasks, "There's a Heavenly Sovereign among them, quite powerful! Fat Ball, it's up to you, can you handle it?"

Fat Ball wagged its tail, worried, "Can I do it?"

"......"

Su Yu laughed, "You can! I believe in you, use the Culture King's boots to stomp him to death!"

Fat Ball reluctantly said, "Alright then!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Fat Ball will handle the Heavenly Sovereign, and the remaining six Heavenly Kings, we'll handle with our seven Heavenly Kings, victory is assured! We have nine second-tier Daofuse, though they have many Daofuse, it's nothing. We also have several Guardians ready to advance! Don't be fooled by their thirty Daofuse, they only have three or four second-tier ones, not even as many as our Heavenly Kings..."

Su Yu laughed loudly, "This time, we'll strike hard! Let Marquis Tongtian teleport us directly to their lair, start killing instantly, clear out some Daofuse in the first wave, they'll never expect us to dare teleport directly to their lair!"

Su Yu laughed arrogantly, "This battle, we'll show our might, make them call for reinforcements, make them bring more Heavenly Sovereigns, that's our success! Let the Myriad Races know how strong this lineage is! And while we're at it, kill some people and ransom back Marquis Giant Axe!"

Everyone looked at each other, feeling it was feasible.

Dangerous as it was, it was still doable!

As long as Fat Ball could hold off the Heavenly Sovereign, Su Yu's side, though fewer in number, had some overall advantages.

The weakest, Jiuyue and Heavendoom, were still fourth-tier Marquises.

The other side might have fifth-tier or even sixth-tier Marquises, those who proved the Dao with the Three Body Method were sixth-tier Marquises!

The Great Zhou King felt a bit uneasy and asked, "Your Majesty, are you sure there's only one Heavenly Sovereign? It's not the number of Heavenly Kings that's worrying, but the possibility of another Heavenly Sovereign. A weaker one can handle two Heavenly Kings, a stronger one, three to five Heavenly Kings might not be able to match..."

Su Yu laughed, "Don't trust my Heaven Gate? When I open the Heaven Gate, unless another Heavenly Sovereign arrives in this short time, it's impossible!"

He continued, "Don't worry, Heavenly Sovereigns aren't cabbages, they're not everywhere! If we encounter danger, I'll lead everyone to retreat, no problem!"

Heavendoom laughed, "Of course we trust Your Majesty. This time, I must kill a few. Without killing, how can I advance? Your Majesty, when we arrive, release me first..."

"Of course!"

Su Yu laughed, "Definitely, don't worry!"

The others said no more.

They were still full of confidence!

No problem!

Su Yu stood up, smiling broadly, "Tongtian!"

"Here!"

Marquis Tongtian hurried out, and Su Yu smiled, "Later, I'll give you the coordinates, teleport us at the fastest speed, I'll suppress the spatial fluctuations, make sure to pinpoint the location, land right above them!"

"No problem!"

Marquis Tongtian chuckled, "I achieved the Dao through portals, I can open doors anywhere. Once I familiarize myself with the Upper Realm, it'll be my territory, I can go wherever I want!"

"Hahaha, ambitious!"

Su Yu praised, nodding, "Everyone, get ready, remember, follow my orders!"

This was Su Yu's repeated reminder.

He had said it many times, the Great Qin King and others thought Su Yu was addressing the newcomers and didn't pay much attention.

Everyone was used to acting on Su Yu's orders, even without him speaking, they understood.

As for whether these newcomers would listen, who cares.

The Great Zhou King glanced at Su Yu, a hint of doubt in his eyes.

Why repeat it so many times?

Year 767 of the New Yu Calendar.

In the depths of Chaos Mountain, Su Yu stood amidst a gathering of powerful figures, his expression unreadable. He transmitted a message to Lantian, "Leave a clone for me. I'll place it within the Mark of Civilization."

Lantian glanced at him, saying nothing. Su Yu, seeing the nod, discreetly transferred the clone from his wrist into the Mark of Civilization. He surveyed the others, confident they would follow orders, except for Heavendoom. After a moment of contemplation, Su Yu spoke directly, "Heavendoom, don't cause trouble. If I tell you to retreat, you retreat. If you ruin my plans, I won't be lenient! Not just you, but the entire Spirit Suppression lineage will bear the shame!"

From the Mark of Civilization, Heavendoom's head emerged, looking somewhat helpless. "Am I really that untrustworthy? I was once a soldier, part of the Spirit Suppression Army. Do you think I don't understand the importance of following orders, Emperor Yu? You're underestimating me!"

Feeling wronged, Heavendoom lamented internally. Why was he always doubted despite his obedience?

Su Yu chuckled, "Then let's pretend I never said it. You're a soldier; just follow orders."

"Of course!" Heavendoom replied, exasperated, choosing to remain silent. This kid, Su Yu, seemed to have forgotten all the good Heavendoom had done for him. Now, he was constantly questioning him, making Heavendoom feel aggrieved and on the verge of tears.

Su Yu, having said his piece, decided not to dwell on it. He had done his utmost to ensure everyone understood the importance of following orders. As long as they did, there might not be any trouble. But if they didn't, even one more Heavenly Sovereign would spell disaster.

"Teleport!" Su Yu commanded, inputting a set of coordinates. Marquis Tongtian immediately activated the teleportation, while Su Yu used the Starry Sky Seal to suppress the teleportation fluctuations.

...

At the same time, in a mountain where Yuehao and his group were gathered, Yuehao frowned deeply. After a long pause, he suddenly said, "We should evacuate. This location has been compromised! It's no longer suitable as a forward base. We need to find another mountain."

Below, an old woman frowned, "Yuehao, we've just set up various formations here. Leaving now would be a waste. Even if we've been discovered, so what?"

The old woman, the second Heavenly Sovereign-level expert present, addressed Yuehao by name, unconcerned. She saw no reason to worry. "You say we've been discovered by the Torchbearer lineage? Even if they know we're here, would they dare come? How many Heavenly Sovereigns do they have? How many quasi-kings?"

She laughed, "If they dare come, that's good news. They're practically walking to their deaths! This place isn't far from our clan. Even if they send two or three Heavenly Sovereigns, they'll be doomed if the battle drags on!"

Yuehao took a deep breath, "Don't forget, there are also Heavenly Sovereigns from the myriad races outside..."

"Do you think the myriad races' Heavenly Sovereigns would act without understanding the situation? Chaos Mountain is dangerous; they wouldn't come recklessly..."

The old woman thought Yuehao was being overly cautious, feeling somewhat weary. "If things really get out of hand, the ancestor can come out and sweep everything away!"

Yuehao frowned at her, speaking after a long pause, "Yueqin, you can't say that. If it comes to a bloody battle, the myriad races aren't without the power to resist. Besides, the longer the time drags on, the more advantageous it is for us..."

Yueqin was speechless. Yuehao was too timid! Did the Torchbearer lineage dare to come? Moving locations every time they were discovered was impractical. Resources weren't free, and Yuehao felt they couldn't just abandon them.

He fell into deep thought. Should they insist on relocating? As he pondered, his brow furrowed slightly. "Yueqin, did you feel a spatial fluctuation?"

The old woman was silent, "Yuehao, are you too tired?"

She was annoyed, "You're on edge over every little thing..."

As she spoke, she too paused. There was indeed a faint spatial fluctuation. The Heavenly Kings hadn't noticed, but Yuehao had sensed it first, and soon she felt it too.

The two exchanged a glance, shock evident in their eyes. Could it be? Yueqin was also moved. How was this possible?

"Enemy attack!" Yuehao shouted, both of them striking towards the void.

"Kill!" At the same time, the sky split open, revealing a portal. Su Yu shouted, a pen stroke or a blade slash following his cry.

"Kill!" he shouted again, as 23 powerful figures appeared, charging forward. The White Dog pulled out a boot, stomping towards Yuehao.

Boom!

The heavens and earth shook as the powerful aura shattered the entire mountain into pieces. The battle erupted suddenly, catching Yuehao and his group off guard. They were stunned. Had they really come to attack?

...

At this moment, the entire Chaos Mountain trembled slightly. In an instant, over 60 Daofuse Realm auras erupted across the region, overwhelming in their might.

Outside Chaos Mountain, several Heavenly Sovereigns were shaken to their cores. What was happening? Was it the Torchbearer lineage? Were they insane? They had just reached an agreement, and now they were attacking?

Destiny Marquis quickly assessed the situation, inhaling sharply, "Three Heavenly Sovereigns, thirteen quasi-kings!"

His words sent shockwaves through everyone. They were all startled. Desolate Heavenly Sovereign's face changed dramatically, "So many? Did the Torchbearer lineage empty their nest? Or did the Chaos lineage?"

"Perhaps neither!" Everyone was alarmed. It was too many. Three Heavenly Sovereigns, over a dozen quasi-kings, and dozens of Daofuse Realm experts. Everyone was aghast. This was supposed to be a small-scale skirmish, at least that's what they thought. But now... it seemed otherwise!

The Torchbearer lineage wasn't supposed to have so many experts. Yet, here they were, leaving everyone in shock. Did the Chaos lineage have so many experts in one place?

As they spoke, wondering if it was all a show, a firework rose in the distance. Someone had died! The first Daofuse expert had fallen, just as the battle began.

"Fight to the death!" Everyone exchanged glances. This was a true death battle, brutal and fierce. A Daofuse battle had just begun, and someone had already died. If this wasn't a death battle, what was?

The Torchbearer lineage's hatred for the Chaos lineage was evident in their swift and ruthless actions. These Heavenly Sovereigns hadn't expected this. They thought it would be a mere surprise attack at most.

"Kill!" "Fight to the death, purge the human traitors, inherit the human fire, and die without regret!" A fierce and resolute shout echoed through the heavens and earth.

Boom!

A massive roar shook the entire world. In the next moment, March flew towards the battle. The Heavenly Sovereigns wanted to say something, but March shouted, "Take the opportunity to kill a few. Do we wait any longer?"

The group of Heavenly Sovereigns frowned but quickly flew towards the battle. Since the Torchbearer lineage had initiated the war, perhaps it was best to seize the opportunity to wipe them out. This lineage was too fierce. Such a large-scale war was something the Heavenly Sovereigns hadn't anticipated.
