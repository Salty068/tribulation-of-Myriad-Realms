Chapter 859: Group Battle

Myriad Race Continent.

The expressions of the few Immortal Emperors were grave. The Human Emperor had actually handed over authority to Su Yu, and Su Yu... was continuously integrating these veteran human experts.

No one here was a fool!

With repeated drills, Su Yu's commands would become ingrained in everyone's minds as a form of willpower. Initially unfamiliar, but after several repetitions, everyone would naturally follow Su Yu's orders.

Simple, yet effective!

The prerequisite was that you could command these proud and fierce warriors, making them listen to you. Su Yu's previous battle had evidently subdued these individuals, and even the top-tier experts dared not act rashly.

The Immortal Emperor was still not fully healed; the time was too short. According to the time here... damn it, the battle had just ended yesterday!

Yes, it was that fast.

Could Su Yu really be planning to launch a second war?

So many rulers of laws had died, and yet they were still not satisfied?

The Immortal Emperor glanced at the Divine Emperor, whose face was also somewhat pale. Previously, all three of them had been severely injured by the Human Emperor. Fortunately, the Immortal Emperor was skilled in healing, so they had somewhat recovered, but they were still not fully healed.

The Divine Emperor's expression was solemn as he spoke in a low voice, "Be cautious!"

Someone gritted their teeth and said, "Divine Emperor, why don't we take the initiative to attack? If we continue to be intimidated like this, after several times, once we let our guard down, it will be easy for them to launch a sudden attack!"

They were all strong experts and understood such tactics well. First, feign an attack, and once the opponent lets their guard down, launch a strong assault!

In battles between powerful experts, a moment of carelessness could easily lead to a breakthrough by the opponent, resulting in instant death.

The Divine Emperor looked expressionless as he glanced at the few Immortal Emperors. The Immortal Emperor transmitted his voice, "We can't continue like this. If it doesn't work... we should take the initiative to attack and repel them!"

The Divine Emperor transmitted back, "How much combat power does the Human Emperor still have?"

In truth, what they were worried about was still the Human Emperor.

Previously, the three great emperors had been instantly defeated by him, and that was when the Human Emperor was not at his peak. This showed how strong the Human Emperor was at his peak. Back then, dealing with the Human Emperor required not just three top experts; nearly all top-tier experts would go to deal with the Human Emperor.

The rest would then fight against the human experts.

...

At the same time.

Su Yu, having adapted a few times, led the crowd in several charges. Once everyone was numb and accustomed to his commands, Su Yu finally revealed a smile.

A surprise attack was actually unlikely.

He didn't expect a surprise attack; it was impossible to achieve.

What he wanted to see was everyone following orders. Just this one point was enough.

On the opposite side, they were currently in full battle readiness.

Su Yu continued to integrate a few more times, and the next moment, he shouted again, "Charge!"

Everyone followed and charged together!

They were used to it!

After several times, everyone was thinking, when they charged to a certain point, Su Yu would shout to retreat.

However, this time, there was no retreat.

Why retreat?

Since everyone was following orders, there was no need to retreat.

"Kill!"

A violent shout awakened everyone, instantly shocking them.

At this moment, the Myriad Race Continent was less than ten thousand meters away from them.

For strong experts, even in the River of Time, it was just a matter of moments.

On the opposite side, countless auras erupted in an instant, and the Divine Emperor's angry shout echoed through the heavens, "Prepare to engage!"

This madman Su Yu actually dared to fight a battle a day!

Just yesterday, dozens of rulers of laws had died, and many were still injured, yet Su Yu had come to kill again!

This bastard!

This guy was even crazier than the Human Emperor. When the Human Emperor fought them, it wasn't this frequent. Over the years, they had spent nearly a thousand years here, and in terms of full-scale battles, there were less than ten. Battles involving more than ten rulers of laws happened quite a few times, once every three to five years, which was already extremely frequent.

But Su Yu, well, once a day!

The combined number of rulers of laws on both sides was approaching 200.

This was an extremely terrifying number!

There weren't many people, but these strong experts, in any era, were top-tier existences, masters of the Great Dao.

At this moment, they were really like charging soldiers, rushing into the enemy's camp.

Boom!

A shocking blade aura erupted; it was Su Yu slashing out with a blade, shouting, "Group charge, don't cut off the opponent, fight collectively!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned. Strong experts usually fought one-on-one, as large-scale battles could easily involve all parties. But today, Su Yu actually wanted them to charge collectively, rather than cutting off the opponent, one-on-one, or several against one.

Suddenly, the Myriad Race side was also a bit flustered.

Collective battle?

Some strong experts were not used to this kind of fighting style and were at a loss.

The Divine Emperor immediately shouted angrily, "Don't scatter, attack together!"

This kind of tactic was somewhat unexpected.

But the Divine Emperor felt that Su Yu had lost his mind. On his side, there were more top-tier experts, and once a battle started, the aftermath could kill many weaker ones. Was Su Yu crazy?

Did he really think that just because he won a battle before, he could be so reckless?

At this moment, nearly two hundred strong experts were crowded together, collectively attacking the opponent.

Boom!

Swords, spears, halberds, axes, hooks, and forks, all kinds of weapons were out, and the power of various Great Daos crisscrossed, creating utter chaos!

This kind of chaotic battle was actually the first time for everyone... or rather, the first time since becoming rulers of laws.

...

At the rear of the crowd.

The Human Emperor's face changed slightly, and he couldn't help but curse, "Madman!"

These were not soldiers!

These were a group of top-tier experts; when have top-tier experts ever charged in groups like this? In a battle between top-tier experts, the aftermath affects both sides, causing both sides' weaker ones to be implicated!

A typical strategy of self-damage of eight hundred, while also damaging the enemy by eight hundred.

No advantage at all!

Su Yu had fought many battles; why would he choose this tactic at this moment?

The Human Emperor couldn't quite understand!

And soon, this tactic resulted in casualties. With so many strong experts on both sides, Su Yu instantly charged at the Divine Emperor, the Radiant King charged at the Immortal Emperor, the Suppressing Martial King charged at the Demon Emperor, and the Radiant King's Consort charged at the Spirit Emperor.

In an instant, the Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether Emperors found themselves without opponents, but in the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by people from both sides.

The three great experts, including those on Su Yu's side, actually felt somewhat restrained.

Suddenly, angry shouts erupted, "Dragon Emperor, shrink your body, don't attack us..."

At this moment, someone shouted angrily beside the Dragon Emperor!

The Dragon and Phoenix experts had massive bodies, and the Myriad Race bodies were actually quite large. At this moment, once they unleashed their power, the range of their waves was too large, affecting many Myriad Race experts as well.

And with the large bodies of the Myriad Race, once they scattered, they would be instantly devoured by the humans. Once they gathered... at this moment, many Myriad Race experts could only maintain human form in battle, unable to revert to their true forms, otherwise, they would be too large, and everyone would be scattered.

...

The Divine Emperor snorted coldly, "Is it just for this?"

The large bodies of the Myriad Race were also being used by Su Yu?

But what could this affect!

A holy power erupted from the Divine Emperor's body, and Su Yu also instantly summoned a powerful force, laughing, "Divine Descent!"

Boom!

At this moment, he was like a god race expert, with an aura comparable to the Divine Emperor. In the blink of an eye, he charged at the Divine Emperor, whose face turned solemn. This guy felt so strong, much stronger than before.

And Su Yu's power of the world was also rapidly spreading over here!

The Divine Emperor's face changed slightly!

The next moment, he frowned and shouted, "Retreat!"

"Retreat from his world domain!"

Fighting within Su Yu's world domain was not a good choice; they could only choose to retreat!

But in this kind of entangled battle, once they retreated, they would leave their backs to the enemy. Just as the Divine Emperor shouted, over there, the Immortal Emperor couldn't help but roar, "Don't retreat, fight!"

The Divine Emperor was shouting nonsense!

At this moment, if they retreated, wouldn't they be giving Su Yu and his people a chance to kill?

He knew that in this entangled battle, the Divine Emperor probably hadn't encountered it for many years and had forgotten that this wasn't a one-on-one fight, where it was easy to retreat. With everyone entangled together, how could they retreat?

Fortunately, the Myriad Race's rulers of laws weren't stupid. When the Divine Emperor shouted to retreat, everyone felt that they couldn't retreat, so there was no major disturbance. But in some areas, a few strong experts wanted to retreat, and at this moment, as soon as the Divine Emperor shouted, they had just retreated a short distance when their slightly slower companions were instantly killed on the spot!

The Divine Emperor was also stunned, instantly realizing his mistake!

This battle was different from the previous ones!

This wasn't a segmented battle but a collective battle. Retreating one would lead to casualties for others. He hurriedly shouted, "Don't retreat, kill the enemy!"

On the opposite side, Su Yu swept out with a blade, the aftermath shaking all directions.

He didn't care about the humans around him!

No reason, he was the leader of the humans!

If they got hurt, they had to endure it.

But the Divine Emperor and his people... hehe!

Sure enough, the Divine Emperor also unleashed his full combat power, a holy fist technique erupting, and with a loud bang, the blade aura and fist force collided, causing many strong experts around to vomit blood and fly backward.

Both humans and Myriad Race members!

On the human side, it was just helplessness.

But on the Myriad Race side, some wanted to retreat from the circle of strong experts!

Seeing this, the Divine Emperor's face changed again, and the next moment, he roared, "Endure it, no one is allowed to retreat!"

Once the strong experts around them retreated to avoid the aftermath, the humans could surround and kill him!

Only at this moment did the Divine Emperor and his people fully understand Su Yu's intentions.

Because... the Myriad Race was not united!

Sure enough, Su Yu's voice sounded like a devil, "One race, one emperor. If you die, your race is finished. The Myriad Realms have long been taken by me. If the emperor of your race falls, I will inform the strong experts guarding the Myriad Realms to exterminate that race!"

"The emperor falls, anomalies appear, the emperor of your race falls... the domain will be in turmoil, the heavens will collapse..."

The Divine Emperor shouted, his holy voice shaking the heavens, "Don't listen, don't care. Once defeated, the Myriad Race as one will all be destroyed!"

At this moment, several strong experts were sweating profusely!

They hadn't expected such a collective battle from Su Yu to have such a huge drawback.

On the Myriad Race side, several top-tier experts had people constantly retreating from their sides. If this continued, there would be big trouble.

The Immortal Emperor enveloped everyone with the Path of Life, roaring, "No matter how severe the injuries, I will help you recover. Do not retreat! How many years has it been, and you still can't see through the treacherous intentions of the human race?"

The humans are deceitful! Every time, it's the same old trick, causing division among the myriad races. Yet, somehow, this trick never fails!

Su Yu chuckled coldly, ignoring them as he roared, unleashing a storm of a million blades in an instant. The aftermath spread, causing damage to both sides.

In the next moment, just as the Divine Emperor was about to erupt, Su Yu shouted, "Human Emperor!"

In the distance, the shadow of the Human Emperor appeared instantly, flying towards them.

The myriad races were shaken!

"Retreat!"

With a thunderous shout, Su Yu harnessed the power of the heavens and earth, leading a group of human experts to withdraw. In the blink of an eye, they separated from the enemy, aided by the power of the heavens and earth—a coordination that the disunited myriad races could not match.

In a flash, Su Yu's side had retreated.

The faces of the Divine Emperor and his companions were extremely grave!

They hadn't suffered a loss!

The battle had lasted only a moment, and the myriad races were unlucky. Due to some mistakes by the Divine Emperor, a ruler of laws was killed. Apart from this, many were injured, but no one else died.

On Su Yu's side, no one died either, apart from the one ruler of laws on the myriad races' side.

In this first chaotic battle, a ruler of laws had died, and that was on the Divine Emperor.

Both sides had people severely injured!

Not just one or two; over ten on Su Yu's side, and the same for the myriad races.

All were affected by the aftermath of the powerful!

The losses were equivalent!

But the Divine Emperor and his companions couldn't be happy. In reality, they should have been pleased, as the Immortal Emperor could heal everyone. However, it seemed that Su Yu's side also had a strong expert of the Path of Life.

The Divine Emperor suddenly said in a deep voice, "Immortal Emperor, is he trying to deplete your strength?"

The Immortal Emperor was taken aback!

At this moment, they did not pursue. The Immortal Emperor was quickly healing those injured, and upon hearing this, he frowned slightly, "He's depleting me, but his people are also getting injured. Would he just ignore them?"

Su Yu's side also had people severely injured!

If you don't heal them, you'll lose a ruler of laws.

If you do, you deplete your resources.

The opposing Life Master seemed to be a second-tier expert, consuming more than himself. What benefit would this bring to Su Yu?

The Divine Emperor was silent.

For a moment, he felt frustrated and chaotic. At this moment, he wanted to pursue and kill them, but with the Human Emperor in action, he didn't dare. Suddenly, he couldn't help but grit his teeth, "Does he expect to kill us one by one in such chaotic battles?"

Previously, it was his mistake.

It doesn't mean it will always be like this!

Su Yu's side only gained a slight advantage this time.

Several strong figures exchanged glances, all feeling a bit troubled.

They were not familiar with Su Yu at all!

His combat methods were completely different from the previous Human Emperor, making such battles extremely uncomfortable!

...

On Su Yu's side.

War King and the others also wore heavy expressions. They hadn't gained much, killing a ruler of laws was an unexpected gain, but now both sides had many severely injured. Was this the result Su Yu wanted?

Did it have any meaning?

If it was a battle of mutual destruction, anyone could fight it!

Especially on the Human Emperor's side, at this moment, War King couldn't help but say in a low voice, "Su Lord... Emperor Yu, we have seven rulers of laws severely injured, more than ten lightly injured, all... Human Emperor's people!"

Was this intentional?

Because the three first-tier experts were all Human Emperor's people, Su Yu had deliberately joined the Human Emperor's side in the battle, causing the first-tier battles to occur almost entirely on their side.

Under the influence of the aftermath, several strong figures were severely injured.

It was only the first battle!

And you have already severely injured so many of us. In such large-scale battles, without distinguishing between friend and foe, the losses will be enormous!

Su Yu looked at them indifferently for a while, then suddenly smiled, "Isn't it good?"

War King frowned. He was fine, but among the crowd, several strong figures instantly became furious, looking towards the shadow of the Human Emperor with anger, "Your Majesty, Su Lord, this..."

The Human Emperor looked at Su Yu, seemingly understanding something, and hesitated slightly, "You... did it on purpose? You want them to return with me?"

Su Yu looked at the Human Emperor and smiled, "Yes! Severely injure a batch... let them recuperate at the rear! The more severe, the better, so severe that they can't participate in the battle, only recuperate at the rear... Once they retreat, no one will care, even if it's fake. Anyway, the injuries are too severe, and their aura is unstable!"

The Human Emperor understood Su Yu's intention and said solemnly, "Can you hold on?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu smiled, "We are severely injured, and so are they. I don't seek to kill the enemy, only mutual destruction! Just right... you take the people and leave, it's great!"

In this way, the retreat can be silent!

The Human Emperor took a deep breath, "If my people leave, then the rest are yours... Once a great battle occurs, the losses will be heavy..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "Then let there be losses!"

The Human Emperor said no more.

And Su Yu, this time, didn't keep them guessing. He looked at those injured, especially the severely injured, and said coldly, "Severely injured in group battles, too weak! Since you're so weak, go back with the Human Emperor! Integrate into his world and see if you can strengthen yourself, otherwise... there's not much use here! Keep fighting until you can't fight anymore, until the end, self-destruct your path, break the path, and then integrate into the Human Emperor's world!"

At this moment, everyone was shocked, already understanding Su Yu's meaning.

It was a battle of mutual destruction!

That's the result he wanted!

Eliminate the weak, let the weak withdraw with the Human Emperor, return to the Myriad Realms, integrate into the world, so that the severely injured can leave without much commotion.

At this moment, King Zhenwu, holding a bloody machete, looked at Su Yu with a strange expression, "So Emperor Yu means, we keep fighting, keep eliminating, until a batch of people can't fight anymore, leave with His Majesty... only then will the battle stop?"

"Stop?"

Su Yu looked at everyone coldly, "There's no stopping, the battle doesn't end! Be prepared for continuous battles!"

Everyone's hearts stirred, and Su Yu quickly said, "The severely injured, the lightly injured, switch places, near the first-tier, follow the uninjured weak! Keep fighting until the myriad races are exhausted!"

With that, Su Yu shouted in a low voice, "Continue the slaughter!"

Boom!

A group of people, with almost no rest, each with shock and bitter smiles, followed Su Yu back into the fray.

Madman!

There were those severely injured, left behind by Su Yu, only two at the moment. These two strong figures were extremely bitter, including King Ping of the Physical Path, who said helplessly, "Your Majesty, is he a madman?"

There's no fighting like this!

The Human Emperor was silent for a while, then said, "He's very smart. Such chaotic battles don't easily result in deaths, but they easily eliminate the weak. Whether it's them or us, the strong will be wary, thus weakening the role of first-tier experts!"

Of course, if such battles continue, both sides will suffer great losses!

Perhaps in the end, a large number of people will die!

But in the early stages, not too many will die.

...

Boom!

The Divine Emperor and his group were also going crazy. This madman Su Yu, after the first battle ended, even just after it ended, actually launched another charge!

Boom!

The battle erupted again, both sides still in group battles, engaging each other, the paths sweeping across the heavens and earth!

The long river was turbulent!

Even the Demon Emperor couldn't help but roar, "Madman, you must know, if this continues, both you and I will lose many people. Once the Three Gates open, neither you nor I will have any power to resist. Do you understand?"

Is there any point in fighting like this?

There's really no point!

They couldn't understand Su Yu's intentions, or did Su Yu not know about the existence beyond the Three Gates?

Su Yu didn't leave, roaring, "Gather, close in, let the weak stand in front, let the severely injured self-destruct. I want to see if the myriad races are ruthless or if my human race is more united!"

Self-destruct your ancestors!

The Demon Emperor had just cursed in his heart when, with a rumble, a strong figure of the Physical Path gritted his teeth, roared, and self-destructed his path. Instantly, his physical body began to collapse, but it caused the opposing strong figure to be severely injured...

Constantly exchanging pieces!

Constantly causing severe injuries!

The severely injured were quickly pulled to the rear, and the myriad races on the opposite side did the same. The Immortal Emperor kept shouting, ensuring the uninjured protected the injured strong figures!

So annoying!

This kind of group battle couldn't play to their strengths, yet they had no choice but to accept this form of combat!

...

Five minutes later.

The Human Emperor appeared again, and the Demon Emperor was somewhat frantic, roaring, "Don't let them retreat. If we're going to fight, let's fight to the end!"

Every time the Human Emperor appeared, both sides would retreat.

If this continued, it would only allow this madman Su Yu to keep depleting them, and who knew how many would die before it ended.

However, this high-intensity battle still made some strong figures a bit tired and fearful.

As Su Yu's side began to retreat, some didn't want to pursue further, and the Divine Emperor and his group couldn't advance alone, only watching as Su Yu's side retreated.

In this battle, both sides had people severely injured again.

And quite a few!

The Immortal Emperor looked at the opposite side and said solemnly, "The other side isn't healing! I somewhat understand now... Is Su Yu trying to incorporate these severely injured guys into his world? Is he just depleting us?"

He vaguely sensed something, but hadn't thought of the Human Emperor yet, because the Human Emperor's world... actually, no one knew about it, and it was only discovered later in the Upper Realm.

Was Su Yu playing this card?

Constantly depleting both sides' strong figures!

He was silent for a while, then said in a low voice, "Keep a close watch on Su Yu. If he dares to let people integrate into his world, launch a full-scale attack immediately!"

In this short time, the number of injured rulers of laws on both sides had almost exceeded thirty!

No period was crazier than Su Yu's.

Continuous battles.

...

On this side, Su Yu led his people back again.

Several were severely injured.

Su Yu glanced at them, not looking too much, as long as they were alive.

These were the ones to be eliminated, and soon they would leave with the Human Emperor.

He looked across at the opposing side, where many were also gravely injured. He chuckled, "Will the Immortal Emperor save them? If he does, he won't be able to sustain it for long. If not, they'll be just like us, leaving the heavily injured behind, unable to fight again, or else their chances of falling are too high!"

If they could truly incapacitate the Immortal Emperor, it would be worth it!

Su Yu rubbed his chest. He had to admit, the Divine Emperor was quite formidable. Even within his own domain, where he wielded the power of twenty paths, he gained no advantage against the Divine Emperor, who managed to land a punch on his chest, shattering his bones. If not for Su Yu's control over his domain, he would have been no match for the Divine Emperor outside of it.

With that, Su Yu shouted once more, "Kill!"

The War King and his allies were on the verge of collapse!

Could they not have a moment to recover and catch their breath?

How could they fight like this? Even though they understood Su Yu's intentions, everyone was utterly exhausted!

...

Boom!

The battle resumed, but this time, the Demon Emperor and his allies changed their strategy. Seven first-tier experts gathered together, instantly altering the situation.

On Su Yu's side, there were four first-tier experts.

At this moment, the War King, Book Spirit, King Yue, and the Great Zhou King gathered to resist the seven first-tier experts, but they were being pushed back step by step. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Su Yu immediately shouted, "Human Emperor!"

Behind him, the Human Emperor was helpless!

Why did Su Yu keep calling for him when he was just a figurehead?

Despite his thoughts, the Human Emperor still erupted with a powerful aura, flying towards them. The first-tier experts gritted their teeth!

Should they retreat?

Or should they test the Human Emperor's strength?

His physical body was shattered, and his sea of will was turbulent. Did the Human Emperor still have any combat power left?

No one knew!

The Divine Emperor quickly transmitted his voice, "Shall we test him?"

To see how much combat power the Human Emperor still possessed?

Among the seven first-tier experts, the Nether Emperor remained silent. He didn't want to test because he was too severely injured. Previously, he had severed his path to merge with Su Yu. If he could recover easily, he would sever his path and merge with Su Yu every day, and Su Yu would surpass the first tier in just a few days!

At this moment, the Nether Emperor, though a first-tier expert, was only evenly matched with the War King and was even slightly at a disadvantage!

The Nether Emperor was unwilling, and the others were also injured. After a moment of hesitation, the Immortal Emperor transmitted his voice, "Retreat for now!"

The Divine Emperor had no choice but to watch as Su Yu and his group quickly retreated once more.

...

The battle continued, unending.

On Su Yu's side, they kept exchanging blows, not seeking to kill the enemy, but to inflict severe injuries!

He was depleting both sides' forces!

The number of rulers of laws participating in the battle was dwindling!

In the blink of an eye, on Su Yu's side, more than twenty rulers of laws were severely injured, some even self-destructing their great paths.

On the myriad races' side, it was about the same, or even more. They dared not easily self-destruct their great paths; living was better than dying, being severely injured was better than severing their paths. Nearly thirty rulers of laws were severely injured, recuperating at the rear.

The Immortal Emperor no longer healed them. If he continued, he would be incapacitated himself and unable to participate in the battle.

A true mutual destruction!

...

"This won't do..."

The Immortal Emperor looked at the exhausted crowd and gritted his teeth, "This won't do!"

The previously carefree Immortal Emperor was no longer carefree, showing signs of madness. "Su Yu is a madman. He's constantly depleting the Human Emperor's forces. Maybe he doesn't even care if the Human Emperor's people die!"

He suddenly realized that the severely injured were almost all the Human Emperor's people.

Whether it was to force them to merge into his domain or to weaken the Human Emperor, on Su Yu's side, the strong ones he brought were rarely injured.

Su Yu could do this, but they couldn't.

At this moment, some people were extremely reluctant to participate in such a large-scale battle.

Someone spoke up, "Immortal Emperor, in this chaotic battle, we can't leverage our advantages. Even first-tier experts can't suppress the opposing first-tier... The other side has one belief, to unite. In this way, when several experts fight, both sides are depleting their strength..."

Logically, if both sides are depleting, it shouldn't matter.

However, on the myriad races' side, some were not too willing.

They were genuinely unwilling!

"If we continue fighting like this, in the end, the first and second tiers will be fine, but the third and fourth tiers will be wiped out!"

The speaker was a third-tier expert, also injured, with some resentment, "We haven't even played a significant role. If we die like this, we won't be content!"

The Demon Emperor couldn't help but scold, "The other side is the same! We're not content, and neither are they! It's about who can hold on!"

Easier said than done!

Someone said in a low voice, "The Demon Emperor won't die. You're a first-tier, but we... are not! It's us who will die! Even if we truly defeat the human race in the end, if everyone below the first tier is wiped out... what then?"

If everyone below the first tier in the human race is wiped out, they are still the human race.

We're different!

If we die, we're not one race, you know?

The Divine Emperor frowned, "This is Su Yu's plan, everyone understands. If you all develop a fear of death and dare not fight, it will be easy for them to seize the opportunity and deliver a thunderous blow. If he wants to deplete, then let him deplete!"

With that, he took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, "Immortal Emperor, don't participate in the battle anymore. Focus on healing people. In this situation, losing one first-tier... doesn't have a significant impact!"

Even though losing the Immortal Emperor would increase the pressure, he still chose to have the Immortal Emperor not participate in the battle but instead comfort everyone.

Otherwise, those severely injured and dying experts would despair.

This was different from Su Yu's side!

The Immortal Emperor nodded slightly. On this side, the Divine Emperor and Immortal Emperor had more say than the Demon Emperor. Generally, some matters were mainly discussed between the Immortal Emperor and Divine Emperor.

The Demon Emperor was somewhat agitated, "Is there no countermeasure?"

Always on the defensive!

Although Su Yu didn't gain much advantage, the Demon Emperor was still extremely uncomfortable. We have more first-tier experts, at worst, let's fight them!

The Immortal Emperor was silent for a while, then transmitted his voice, "Countermeasure? Yes! As long as you can persuade some of the severely injured rulers of laws to self-destruct their great paths, I have confidence that in one battle, we can kill multiple rulers of laws on the other side!"

"......"

The Demon Emperor instantly pursed his lips, forget it, pretend I didn't say anything.

How could that be possible!

He glanced back at those severely injured guys, some of whom might not even be severely injured but were afraid of death and didn't want to fight anymore, also recuperating at the rear.

Damn!

The Demon Emperor cursed inwardly!

No wonder the human race, even with fewer people, isn't afraid of the myriad races, especially now when they have quite a few people.

On the human race's side, the severely injured rulers of laws dare to self-destruct their great paths.

The myriad races dare not!

If they self-destruct, they can almost only wait for death. If they wait for death, the emperor of the race will fall, and this battle will be meaningless.

This is the biggest difference between the human race and the myriad races!

The Demon Emperor felt somewhat helpless and transmitted his voice, "Are we just going to remain passive like this?"

The Immortal Emperor looked at the Divine Emperor, and the Divine Emperor looked at the Demon Emperor. After a moment, the Immortal Emperor's eyes turned cold, and he transmitted his voice, "Su Yu must have a purpose... After discussing with the Divine Emperor, if it comes to a critical moment, we will throw all the severely injured ones out, whether they self-destruct or explode... to severely injure the human race!"

The Demon Emperor's heart turned cold!

So ruthless!

The Immortal Emperor transmitted his voice, "We have no choice but to sacrifice some people. If they don't dare to self-destruct, if they're unwilling, Su Yu's side, this time, isn't seeking to kill the enemy. Instead, it's a blow to our confidence! If this continues, more and more people will choose to be severely injured or voluntarily get severely injured to withdraw from the battle!"

He's not stupid; everyone can see that some rulers of laws are almost deliberately getting severely injured and then withdrawing from the battle.

Afraid of death!

Yet, they can't be reprimanded too harshly. After all, they're not one race, just an alliance.

If they were one race, it would be easier to handle!

...

"Huff..."

At this moment, on Su Yu's side, everyone was panting heavily. Even the Radiant King couldn't help but speak, "We need to take a breather, Your Majesty Emperor Yu. If this continues, we truly won't be able to fight anymore. We're too exhausted!"

In such a battle, the focus, concentration, and life-and-death crisis all exact a different toll.

This isn't a sparring match!

Su Yu was also panting, feeling very fatigued, with additional injuries on his body.

But looking at the other side, Su Yu smiled, "Are we tired? Aren't they tired too? At least we're all on the same side, but over there, it's every man for himself. I think some of the exhausted experts would rather be severely injured and avoid the battle than be distracted and killed due to exhaustion, right?"

What did he mean?

Everyone felt a chill in their hearts, as if they understood.

This madman seemed to want to continue the war?

They had already fought several rounds, and except for the first unfortunate one, none of the remaining experts had died.

Such a battle, where no one dies, is even more torturous!

Su Yu ignored them, looking towards the rear at the Human Emperor, transmitting his voice, "Deplete the other side, both sides are exhausted... I'll wait for you to return. You take the people at the rear to recuperate for a few days, then come back to assist in the battle... At that time, with experts in peak condition, we'll face the other side! I think we can definitely achieve great results!"

The Human Emperor thought for a moment and reminded, "Don't underestimate the myriad races. Those old guys are also ruthless! They know we must have a purpose if we keep fighting this war of attrition... Be careful, they might pull off something big!"

Something big?

Su Yu pondered for a moment, how could the other side pull off something big?

After thinking for a while, Su Yu transmitted his voice, "If they want to reverse the situation, it's nothing more than you coming and continuing the fight! Or... hitting me hard?"

Thinking of this, he was slightly moved, "They wouldn't want to blow up my domain, would they? Severely injure my domain?"

If that happened, Su Yu's side would see a significant drop in combat power!

The Human Emperor was also moved, transmitting his voice, "It's possible. The Immortal Emperor, Divine Emperor, these few, are ruthless. I also noticed that some of the myriad races are avoiding battle. These few might kill a chicken to warn the monkeys... or even plot against them, using their lives to exchange for your domain being severely injured!"

Su Yu judged that this possibility still existed.

If it truly comes to that, his world wouldn't be invincible. If too many powerful beings self-destructed, specifically targeting his world, Su Yu's world could be breached or severed from its connection to the Myriad Realms.

The Human Emperor asked, "When do you want me to leave?"

Su Yu glanced at the heavily injured experts; there were quite a few of them. Below the second tier, almost nine out of ten were severely injured. Of course, most of them were from the Human Emperor's side.

After some thought, Su Yu transmitted a message, "Wait a little longer. Leave when even the second-tier ones are too injured to fight."

The Human Emperor nodded.

Su Yu then shouted again, "Charge!"

A group of people, including those under Su Yu's command, were panting heavily from exhaustion. Even Fat Ball was sticking out its tongue in fatigue. They were battered, injured, and had to keep fighting relentlessly. Su Yu was a tyrant, a madman. This kind of fighting was driving even his own people to the brink of collapse!

The fact that the Myriad Races hadn't collapsed yet was entirely due to a few top-tier experts holding the line, maintaining an advantage in the first-tier battles. Otherwise, they would have surely fallen apart by now.

Even the battle-hardened Heavendoom and Martial Emperor were fighting to the point of wanting to vomit blood! Truly, it was too exhausting.

High-intensity battles, for top-tier experts, once a year would be enough. Now, they were fighting ten times a day. By now, everyone was utterly fatigued!

...

Boom!

The power of various Daos erupted once more. Both sides were entangled, growing weary of the endless fighting. Today marked the ninth battle.

In this battle, even the Immortal Emperor did not participate. Instead, he stayed behind to heal the injured. Yes, healing. During this time, the Immortal Emperor was also making some preparations, even discerning who was truly injured and who was faking it.

At this point, the Immortal Emperor and his allies knew that Su Yu and his group had a purpose, just as they did. It was a matter of who could outwit whom.

The number of severely injured experts continued to rise. The Immortal Emperor kept healing them, consuming a tremendous amount of resources. However, this had the benefit of stabilizing the front lines. Seeing that no one was dying, everyone felt more at ease. If they couldn't fight, they would just get severely injured and retreat from the front lines.

Both sides were losing members!

...

On this day, the tenth battle erupted once more. This time, the Human Emperor's shadow, along with some others, quickly vanished.

The Great Zhou King's fake character was used again. It was difficult to disguise as a powerful expert, but not so hard to disguise as some injured ones. Moreover, with the cooperation of Su Yu's world power, the Human Emperor and his group, led by Marquis Tongtian, quickly disappeared from the battlefield.

As he left, the Human Emperor was actually very worried. This was just the appetizer. When he severed his Dao, if the Myriad Races weren't foolish, they would surely launch an all-out assault. That would be Su Yu's greatest crisis!

"We must go and return quickly!"

The Human Emperor was anxious. They had to quickly merge with the world, allowing everyone to integrate their Daos within, sever the Human Emperor's Great Dao, become spirits of the world, and bring the injured experts back to fight again!

To rescue Su Yu!

Otherwise, Su Yu would face the same situation he did back then.

"Hurry!"

The Human Emperor shouted lowly, looking at the people behind him, he said heavily, "Su Yu and his people rescued us. Now that most of our people have retreated... once I sever my Dao, if the Myriad Races aren't foolish, they will attack even at a great cost! We... don't want to be deserters, nor will we be. I hope everyone quickly merges with the world and returns to aid immediately!"

Everyone was solemn, nodding in agreement.

But soon, someone laughed, "Your Majesty, this one... can really fight! And dares to fight! Ten battles in one day, I'm about to vomit from fighting... When Giant Axe and the others said he was crazy, I didn't believe it. Now I do! This guy is a bit of a freak, Your Majesty, I feel like you're not as crazy as he is..."

The Human Emperor chuckled, quickly shook his head, and sighed, "He's different... forget it, I won't say more, lest he causes trouble."

Su Yu was different; he had experienced too much death. This guy was resilient to the extreme. What were ten battles?

The Myriad Races would eventually be driven mad by him!
