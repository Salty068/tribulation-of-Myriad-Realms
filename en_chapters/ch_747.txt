Chapter 747: Transition and Investigation

The sincerity shown by the Great Zhou King was indeed substantial. After careful consideration, the several Heavenly Sovereigns realized that they stood to gain significantly without incurring much cost. All they had to do was return a few powerful human cultivators, which could potentially incite a conflict between the Torchbearers and the Chaos lineage—a favorable outcome.

With this foundation, the negotiations continued for a while longer, and soon a decision was reached. Marquis Nanxi and a few others would be released promptly. Until the Torchbearers managed to kill two quasi-kings and two top-tier Daofuse cultivators, Giant Axe would remain imprisoned, only to be released once the Torchbearers succeeded in killing a Heavenly Sovereign.

Eventually, the discussion turned to the logistics of the handover. At this point, Su Yu interjected, "Please deliver General Xuelan and the others to the outskirts of First Line Gorge. After that, you may leave, and we will send someone to receive them."

First Line Gorge was where General Yingwu had previously hidden. The Heavenly Sovereigns pondered whether this indicated the Torchbearers' presence there. However, it seemed unlikely. It was more probable that they intended to use the natural defenses of First Line Gorge to evade pursuit.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign did not refuse. Although he was eager to locate the Torchbearers' hideout in the Upper Realm, he knew it was not worth forcing the issue. As long as the Torchbearers were willing to engage the Chaos lineage first, certain matters could be tolerated.

Su Yu continued, "Additionally, you previously killed several ancient beasts. We hope you can gift them to us."

With genuine sincerity, Su Yu explained, "To conceal our movements, we have refrained from killing ancient beasts to create formation symbols. If we are to act, we will need some ancient beast corpses to make these symbols."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign smiled, "Those are Daofuse ancient beast corpses... quite the treasures!"

Su Yu nodded, "They are indeed treasures. However, if we cannot produce enough formation symbols, we will have no choice but to target the ancient beasts ourselves. Doing so would compromise our secrecy and likely lead to unnecessary complications."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign was tempted to say that it would be better if they were not secretive, hoping they would reveal their strength and clash with the Chaos lineage. But Su Yu quickly added, "Even if we hunt ancient beasts, it will be on the periphery. Such actions would draw too much attention, prompting the Chaos lineage to be more cautious and suspicious of our intentions. They might even guess that we are making formation symbols, which would expose us completely."

Complete exposure would also reveal the alliance between the myriad races and the Torchbearers, as the myriad races had not intervened in their hunt for ancient beasts. This would make it easy to deduce their cooperation.

After some consideration, Moon Heavenly Sovereign agreed, "Alright, we killed four ancient beasts last time. We'll give you two of them."

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. With that, the agreement was settled. Any further cooperation would have to wait until after Su Yu and his group took action.

The nine Heavenly Sovereigns did not linger. Once Su Yu explained the method for setting up the formations, they quickly departed.

...

Once they left, the Great Zhou King and Su Yu exchanged glances without any verbal communication. Soon, their avatars burned away, erasing all traces as they vanished completely. These avatars were divine characters, essentially embryonic forms of the power of laws, and extremely valuable. Yet, to avoid being tracked, they had no choice but to destroy them.

...

Outside the Mountain of Dao Origin, several pairs of eyes watched from the void, each showing a hint of disappointment.

Dao Heavenly Sovereign's voice echoed softly, "They are very cautious, burning their avatars immediately. It seems tracking them will be difficult."

"Let's retreat. The ancient beasts nearby have sensed our presence. It's time to go!"

In an instant, the Heavenly Sovereigns disappeared. Their true bodies had been present, concealed just enough to avoid detection by the ancient beasts. If Su Yu and his group had also come in person, they might have seized the opportunity to capture them. However, since only avatars were present, and those were destroyed after the meeting, the Heavenly Sovereigns were left feeling helpless.

...

After some time, the Heavenly Sovereigns returned to the edge of Chaos Mountain. Soon, they gathered together.

Dao Heavenly Sovereign gazed into the depths of Chaos Mountain, taking a deep breath before speaking slowly, "The Torchbearers seem sincere about cooperating. Of course, our cooperation is driven by the Chaos lineage's strength, which we do not fully understand. Since they are willing to act as vanguards, we can assess the Chaos lineage's power before deciding whether to continue the alliance."

If Chaos Mountain proved weak, there would be no need for further cooperation. But if it was strong, the alliance would be crucial.

Demon Heavenly Sovereign's voice was cold, "Do we really have to release those captives?"

He was reluctant to let them go.

"Release them!" Moon Heavenly Sovereign replied with a broad smile, "The two quasi-kings are formidable, but the key is that we still have Marquis Giant Axe. The Torchbearers won't act recklessly. If they want to kill an equal number of quasi-kings, they might expose their hidden strength, allowing us to gauge their true capabilities. In that sense, it's not a loss."

After some thought, the Heavenly Sovereigns nodded in agreement.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign added, "I'll personally escort them to First Line Gorge, with Destiny Marquis accompanying me. Perhaps we can glean some insights."

Destiny Marquis remained calm, nodding slightly without objection.

...

At the outskirts of the Source of the Dao, Marquis Giant Axe and his companions were imprisoned, awaiting their fate. They were despondent, having been captured immediately upon emerging from seclusion. The Heavenly Sovereigns had barely interacted with them, and they had not seen any humans, leaving them in despair.

At that moment, they were confined in a valley, surrounded by myriad race experts on guard. Marquis Giant Axe surveyed the area and communicated telepathically, "Xuelan, we need to find a way to escape, even if it means sacrificing ourselves. If we don't, they'll eventually deal with us."

Among the group, Marquis Xuelan, unlike the emaciated Qirong, retained her elegance despite her weariness. Her hair, white as snow, fluttered in the wind. Hearing Marquis Giant Axe's message, she looked at him and replied telepathically, "How can we escape? We've been sealed, and even a weak Daofuse cultivator is beyond our match. There are several quasi-king realm experts outside..."

Marquis Giant Axe was frustrated but quickly responded, "Even with my body alone, I can still fight! Although I haven't fully embraced the path of the physical body, I've honed my body to be incredibly strong!"

For those who followed the path of the physical body, even being sealed left them with considerable strength. For instance, Hundred Battle, despite being sealed, could still battle Heavenly Sovereigns with his physical prowess.

The group turned their attention to Marquis Giant Axe, who began discussing escape plans with them. Finally, Marquis Xuelan suggested, "Marquis Giant Axe, among us, you have the best chance of escaping. If it comes to it, focus on your escape. Don't worry about us. It's unrealistic for all of us to flee together."

They had made their decision. If escape was possible, Marquis Giant Axe should be the one to attempt it. Better one escape than none.

As they were planning, their expressions suddenly changed. A powerful aura swept over them.

"Heavenly Sovereign!"

"Lord!"

The surrounding experts greeted the newcomers, and soon, the figures of several Heavenly Sovereigns appeared. Moon Heavenly Sovereign descended into the valley, landing in front of them with a smile, "How have you been these past few days?"

Marquis Giant Axe's face darkened, and he gritted his teeth, "You bastard, you finally came! If you're going to kill us, just do it. Don't think I'm afraid of you!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign remained unperturbed, smiling, "Marquis Giant Axe, you might be spending a long time with us. We'll have plenty of opportunities to meet, no need to rush."

He then turned to Marquis Xuelan and the others, smiling, "As for you, Marquis Xuelan, it might be difficult to meet again. We haven't even had a chance to catch up."

Marquis Giant Axe's expression changed, "What are you planning?"

Was he going to kill them?

Moon Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "Nothing much. Marquis Nanxi, come with me. I'll send you on your way."

Marquis Giant Axe's expression changed again, and he roared, "If you're going to kill, kill me first! Moon Eater, don't think you can kill them before I die!"

His aura surged, his body strong and ready to attack Moon Heavenly Sovereign. Although some of his power had been sealed, he remained formidable.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign, seeing his anger, smiled, "Marquis Giant Axe, I'm not going to kill them. I'm just sending them away. You should worry about yourself first."

What did he mean?

Marquis Giant Axe glared, his face filled with anger.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign's smile widened, "Marquis Giant Axe, someone from the human race has paid a high price to buy them back. Your strength is too great, and they can't afford you right now. So, it seems you'll be staying with us for a while, perhaps a long time."

The group was stunned.

Sold them?

What was going on?

Moon Heavenly Sovereign's tone was playful, "Don't you understand? You were captured to be sold to certain people. But now, because of your strength, they can't afford you. So, Marquis Giant Axe, if I were you, I'd be more concerned about myself!"

Who were you standing up for? Was it necessary?

These individuals were about to be released. The only one truly imprisoned was you. Didn't you realize that?

Marquis Giant Axe was taken aback, disbelief and confusion on his face, "You... you sold Marquis Xuelan and the others? To whom? The human race... the human race hasn't been wiped out?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "Of course not. But I won't say more. Marquis Xuelan and the others will find out soon enough. As for you, Marquis Giant Axe, settle in."

Marquis Giant Axe's expression changed drastically. Marquis Nanxi and the others also looked surprised. Marquis Xuelan's voice was cold as she spoke, "Moon Eater, are you saying we'll soon be free, but Marquis Giant Axe... won't be able to leave?"

"Indeed!" Moon Heavenly Sovereign replied.

Moon Heavenly Venerable chuckled, "He's reached the Heavenly Venerable domain; how could we let him go so easily? Giant Axe, do you regret becoming a Heavenly Venerable? If you hadn't, perhaps you could have left with them this time."

Giant Axe Marquis's expression shifted repeatedly. So, because of his strength, the humans couldn't afford him? What was this?

Moon Heavenly Venerable quickly added with a smile, "Of course, the humans don't actually want to buy you. You're strong but disobedient. Nowadays, Heavenly Venerable is the limit of combat power, and they don't want to buy someone they can't control."

He laughed, "We gave them a choice, two options at the same price: buy Xuelan and the others or buy you. They quickly made their choice."

Giant Axe Marquis huffed, while General Xuelan frowned slightly and transmitted her voice, "Don't listen to his nonsense, Giant Axe. Stay calm and don't get distracted!"

She was worried that Giant Axe might be provoked by Moon Heavenly Venerable. Warriors like Giant Axe were known for their fiery tempers.

"I know, it's fine!" Giant Axe Marquis quickly replied, "This guy is just trying to provoke me!"

Even though he understood, it still didn't feel good. Everyone else was being bought, and he had to stay.

Moon Heavenly Venerable didn't care about these things and continued to smile, "Let's go, Xuelan. You'll soon be free, but I still have some things to say to you, and I'll also talk about the current situation."

With a wave of his hand, he trapped them in a transparent bubble and, under Giant Axe's angry gaze, quickly left with them.

...

On the road.

Moon Heavenly Venerable wore a smile, but soon it turned into a sigh, "You and I are all pawns, all beings are pawns! It's been a long time since you went into seclusion, so let me briefly explain the situation."

He briefly recounted the events from the Third Tide to the Ninth Tide.

"Only at the end did we realize that both humans and the myriad races are pawns! Pawns of the Torchbearer lineage and the Control King lineage, or rather, the struggle between the Human Emperor and the Control King has spread to this!"

"Whether it's Hundred Battle or Moon Luo, they're all just pawns. The real players are the leaders of the Torchbearer lineage and the Control King lineage!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable sighed, "What a strategy, using the myriad races as pawns, using Daofuse as soldiers, fighting for a hundred thousand years with countless casualties. In ancient times, less than one in ten marquises survived. Generations of powerful heroes have fallen! Who doesn't have three or five friends, and now, they're all gone, right?"

"In the end, all of this is just because of the internal strife between these two lineages... how pitiful!"

At this moment, the four great experts all had strange expressions.

Pawns? Are we all pawns?

Marquis Nanxi suppressed his complex emotions and calmly said, "Is Moon Eclipse Marquis telling us that when we return, we'll just be pawns of the Torchbearer lineage?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable smiled, "That's the truth!"

He continued, "So, in this Myriad Realms, you and I are the pitiful ones! We don't believe in fate, but we have to believe, we have to submit to the choices of fate... We were born as pawns, how can we resist?"

He sighed deeply, "Friends, now we are cooperating with the Torchbearer lineage. After years of fighting and countless deaths, we have no choice but to cooperate now. It's a big joke, but... we have no choice! If you have any thoughts, you can come to the Myriad Race Mountain to chat anytime. You're always welcome, and we'll surely welcome you with open arms!"

Xuelan frowned slightly, "Thank you for your kind offer, Moon Eclipse Marquis!"

This guy, was he trying to sow discord among them?

She glanced at the other three, who were all frowning and silent.

Hearing such things wouldn't make anyone feel good.

After countless years of war, now someone jumps out and tells them that all of this was actually the calculation of two lineages, all within their grasp.

How could that feel good?

The key point was that the two lineages in conflict were both human!

The last battle of the previous tide resulted in the death of over a hundred Daofuse experts, which was intolerable.

Among them were many of their old friends, who died at the hands of the Torchbearer and Chaos lineages.

Moon Eclipse Marquis smiled again, "When you return, it's best not to mention these things. Even if the Torchbearer lineage welcomes you back, they will be cautious and may not let you participate in some core secrets!"

Clearly, he was trying to provoke them!

General Xuelan coldly said, "Thank you for the reminder, Moon Eclipse Marquis. We understand!"

This guy had no good intentions.

The fear was that the Torchbearer lineage might really guard against them, or even reject them, which would be very troublesome.

Throughout the journey, Moon Eclipse Marquis was very polite to them.

So polite that he didn't seem like an enemy!

Until they reached First Line Gorge, Moon Heavenly Venerable called out loudly, "Is anyone there? I've brought Xuelan and some old friends. Please take them back soon to recuperate. I've been neglecting them these past few days!"

Soon, a strong figure with a faint aura appeared in First Line Gorge.

It was a clone of Lantian!

However, this clone was not weak, barely possessing the aura of Daofuse.

Moon Heavenly Venerable smiled, suddenly unsealing the human experts, stepping back, and said with a smile, "Old friends, sorry for the previous neglect. Now, just follow this person and leave!"

Lantian's clone frowned slightly.

Unsealing them wasn't a good thing. Once unsealed, if something went wrong, it would be hard to control, especially with two Heavenly Kings present, and the other two were top-tier Daofuse.

Moon Heavenly Venerable took a few steps back and smiled again, "I've brought the people to you, the deal is done! However, I think it's best to ask these people if they're willing to leave with you..."

He looked at the experts and smiled, "If you want to leave on your own and find a place to recuperate, I think the Torchbearer lineage won't stop you. After all, you're all humans, and if you remain active in the Upper Realm, we won't harm you."

Not far away, Lantian silently watched them.

He glanced at Moon Heavenly Venerable and suddenly chuckled, "You'll never achieve anything in your life!"

It was unclear if he was talking about Moon Heavenly Venerable or Xuelan and the others.

Lantian didn't bother to say more and directly looked at the four, saying indifferently, "Seal yourselves. If you can accept it, come over. If not, go mix with Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others!"

The experts' expressions changed slightly.

Marquis Nanxi frowned slightly, "Friend from the Torchbearer lineage, do you know Bingku..."

"I don't know!"

Lantian replied calmly, "Moon Heavenly Venerable, let me make it clear. If these people run away, according to the previous agreement, they won't count towards the quota. Whether you kill or capture them, it has nothing to do with us! For every person that comes, we do a certain amount of work!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable laughed, "Naturally!"

A little provocation... isn't bad!

Even if these people choose to follow this guy, they might still feel a bit uncomfortable, right?

Maybe it could be useful in the future!

If not, it doesn't matter, as he wouldn't lose anything anyway.

At this moment, Marquis Nanxi and the others were all frowning slightly.

Moon Heavenly Venerable had unsealed them, but the humans required them to seal themselves. What was this?

Was it distrust?

If they didn't trust them, why save them?

Moreover, it felt like buying vegetables, making them feel somewhat uncomfortable. They all looked at Xuelan, wanting to know what she thought.

Xuelan glanced at Lantian, and after a moment, her aura began to decline as she started to seal herself, expressionless, leaving her thoughts unknown.

Seeing this, the others felt helpless and had no choice but to seal themselves as well.

It was a bit suffocating!

Lantian smiled, directly grabbing them, making them even more uncomfortable. Lantian quickly led them into the depths of First Line Gorge, smiling, "No need to see us off, Moon Heavenly Venerable. We'll return on our own!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable stood outside First Line Gorge, smiled, and didn't follow.

Once they entered First Line Gorge, Moon Heavenly Venerable softly asked, "Brother Tianming, did you see anything?"

Destiny Marquis appeared instantly, observed for a moment, and softly said, "They won't stay long in First Line Gorge. Marquis Tongtian should be coming to pick them up! I sensed some faint spatial fluctuations."

Moon Heavenly Venerable nodded slightly, took a deep breath, "These guys are hiding deep! It seems we'll have to wait until they launch an attack on the Chaos lineage to see their depth."

...

Inside First Line Gorge.

Indeed, it was Marquis Tongtian who came to pick them up.

At this moment, they delved deeper into First Line Gorge, and soon, Marquis Tongtian appeared, causing a slight spatial fluctuation. Upon appearing, he clicked his tongue, "Exposing another passage for these guys, is it worth it?"

Saying this, Marquis Tongtian looked at them and quickly smiled, "General Xuelan, Nanxi, long time no see!"

"Tongtian!"

Marquis Nanxi was somewhat surprised, "You're actually here!"

Tongtian was actually here!

"Are you also from the Torchbearer lineage?"

General Xuelan asked solemnly, "You've always guarded the eighth floor entrance of the Luminous Domain Mansion. When did you join the Torchbearer lineage? Isn't it said that the Torchbearer lineage is all humans?"

Marquis Tongtian chuckled, "Who said that? Alright, less nonsense, let's go. If we're delayed any longer and they lock onto our lair, it won't be good!"

After speaking, he looked at Lantian, "Are you coming?"

"Not for now!"

Lantian smiled, "You take them first. I'll clean up the traces here."

"Then I'll go first. Rest assured, if these guys dare to cause trouble, I'll kill them all..."

Xuelan and the others were speechless. This Marquis Tongtian, his words were truly annoying!

Soon, they entered the portal presented by Marquis Tongtian and were teleported away.

Meanwhile, Lantian quickly erased some residual fluctuations, sighed, and lamented, "Recently, I've lost a lot of clones. I need to make more!"

The losses were significant!

To maintain secrecy, every time a clone appeared, if there were strong individuals nearby, it had to be incinerated on the spot, as per Su Yu's orders.

...

During the teleportation, Marquis Tongtian didn't transport them directly into Chaos Mountain.

Instead, he took a detour, and soon, they picked up someone along the way—Su Yu.

Su Yu remained silent as he quickly transported to the outskirts of the Source of the Dao, under the curious gazes of Xuelan and the others. The Heavenly Sovereigns had just swept through this area and left not long ago. Su Yu, with his companions, entered the Source of the Dao and tore through the River of Time.

Under the somewhat angry gazes of the others, he directly threw them into the river, letting the currents wash over them. Marquis Nanxi, an elderly man with white hair, quickly understood Su Yu's intentions and said, "Fellow Daoist, Marquis Yue Shi did not leave any tracking marks on us... Otherwise, we would have noticed!"

He knew that this white-haired individual seemed worried about being tracked. However, they were all Heavenly King-level experts; it wasn't that easy to track them.

Su Yu ignored him and continued to cleanse them. After a while, two small Heaven Gates appeared in his eyes. He glanced at the group, suddenly frowning slightly. He struck General Xuelan with a palm, sealing her before she could react. Su Yu reached out as if grabbing something from the void.

The next moment, General Xuelan felt a slight fluctuation in her dao, and Su Yu extracted a faint wisp of aura from the air.

Su Yu frowned slightly, then snorted coldly, "Destiny, if this old ghost keeps playing these tricks, I won't be polite next time we meet!"

Boom!

He crushed that wisp of aura and continued to sweep the area, carefully probing the dao before leading the somewhat astonished experts away from the spot.

...

Outside the First Line Gorge.

Destiny Marquis remained expressionless, though his heart stirred. He had been discovered! The power of fate he had hidden within the dao was quickly detected and extinguished. The other party must have opened the Heaven Gate!

"Is this the Emperor Yu that the River spoke of?" Destiny pondered, but he wasn't too concerned. It was just a small test. If the other party couldn't even detect his tracking, leading a group to his lair would mean they weren't worth considering. They wouldn't be enough to sway him to their side, as they lacked sufficient means.

Now that his mark had been discovered, it showed that these people were not weak and were quite vigilant.

Beside him, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign suddenly asked, "What is Destiny thinking about?"

"Nothing, just wondering if any old friends will fall in the upcoming battle..."

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign looked at him for a moment, smiled, and said nothing more.

...

Marquis Tongtian continued to transport people. This time, Su Yu used the Starry Sky Seal to suppress fluctuations, making the spatial ripples extremely faint. Moments later, the scene brightened, and they arrived at their destination.

It was a cave, but the interior was well-lit and spacious. This was a retreat prepared by the Space Ancient Beast Race, capable of accommodating many space ancient beasts.

Xuelan and the others quickly scanned the cave, slightly shocked by the number of strong individuals inside. The key wasn't the others; Xuelan suddenly looked at a certain dog, her eyes showing a hint of surprise. Fat Ball, who had just returned with Wan Tiansheng, sniffed the air and looked at Xuelan.

With some confusion, Fat Ball hesitated, "I think I've seen you before!"

Xuelan replied with surprise, "We have met, a long time ago! Are you... Fat Ball?"

"It's me!"

Fat Ball wagged its tail, recalling for a moment before asking, "Did you come to our house with Snow King?"

Xuelan was slightly moved, "It really is you! Has Lord Culture King... returned?"

"No!"

Fat Ball shook its head and, seeing Su Yu looking over, explained, "She came with Snow King to visit the master's house a long time ago..."

Su Yu nodded slightly. The daughter of the Human King visiting the Culture King's Residence was not unusual, though it had been many years.

At this moment, others also gathered around.

"Emperor Yu!"

"Your Majesty!"

Everyone greeted him, and Su Yu nodded, seeing Xuelan and the others on high alert. Without wasting words, he said directly, "No talk of feelings or friendships. I rescued you from the Myriad Races at the cost of killing two quasi-kings, two top-tier Daofuse experts, and relinquishing the formation that prevents Chaos Mountain's rejection, as well as not opposing their pseudo-dao experts..."

Su Yu said solemnly, "I paid a great price. I don't expect you to submit to me! Nor do I have the time to tame you bit by bit. Since you cost me so much, just create enough benefits for me! Afterward, whether you stay or leave, I don't care!"

Without waiting for them to respond, Su Yu quickly said, "Introduce yourselves and mention your specialties!"

Xuelan and the others looked at Marquis Huoyun and the others, whom they recognized. There were quite a few old acquaintances here. However, at this moment, everyone seemed quite low-key and didn't greet them.

General Xuelan assessed the situation and quickly said, "I am Xuelan, daughter of Snow King, quasi-king realm, specializing in the Dao of Ice and Snow!"

Marquis Nanxi followed, "Nanxi, quasi-king realm, under Radiant King! Specializes in tracking, formerly the scout leader under Radiant King!"

"Wushan, under Cloud King, specializes in the Dao of Mist, peak Daofuse!"

"Jiang Hai, under Battle King, body dao, specializes in spear techniques, peak Daofuse."

The four strong individuals belonged to different Human Kings.

Hearing Jiang Hai, the battle general under Battle King, Su Yu frowned slightly, looking at the muscular middle-aged man with a weathered face. Su Yu asked, "Under Battle King?"

"Yes!"

Jiang Hai felt a bit odd, wondering why everyone was looking at him like that.

Not only Su Yu, but others around were also watching him.

Su Yu said solemnly, "Hundred Battle is a descendant of Battle King. Do you know Hundred Battle?"

Jiang Hai was slightly stunned, and after a moment, he said, "Marquis Yue Shi mentioned the Human Lord who buried over a hundred Daofuse in the Ninth Tide..."

He's a descendant of Battle King?

No wonder everyone was looking at him like that.

Jiang Hai wanted to say something, but Su Yu raised his hand, "Enough, no more of this!"

He looked at them, "If you have questions, ask others later. I'm pressed for time and won't say much!"

Su Yu quickly turned to Wan Tiansheng and the others, "Currently, the Myriad Races are still planning step by step. Who knows how long it will take for them to attack Chaos Mountain! If this drags on for years, the lower realm will open!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "Chaos Mountain knows of our existence, and they are happy to drag it out. Maybe dragging it out benefits them. Once the lower realm opens, these guys might have some connection with the Land of the Abyss in the Death Realm, easily creating chaos for me!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Therefore, we must take the initiative to attack now. First, to accelerate the outbreak of war; second, to expose the strength of the Control King's lineage; third, to exchange for Marquis Giant Axe!"

"But even if we fight, whether we can win or not, even if we do win... it must be a painful and difficult victory. We must not win too easily, lest the Myriad Races underestimate the Control King's lineage and become more wary of us!"

Wan Tiansheng frowned, "Does Emperor Yu mean we have to fight?"

Su Yu nodded, "We must fight! I'm certain the Chaos lineage is extremely powerful! How to fight this time, I'm considering. On one hand, we can't expose all our strength; on the other hand, it's best if some people die!"

The group inhaled sharply. Death!

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King and smiled, "Can't the Great Zhou King handle this?"

The Great Zhou King frowned, "Does Your Majesty mean that even if no one dies, we should pretend that someone did, using fake divine characters to trigger a rule explosion?"

Su Yu nodded, "Exactly! Of course, before, we only pretended to be Eternal. Can we pretend to be Daofuse?"

"It's a bit difficult!"

Wan Tiansheng quickly said, "I did find a base of the Chaos lineage, but... it's extremely dangerous!"

Wan Tiansheng said heavily, "I went with Fat Ball, cut off the dao connection, and even brought a Heaven-Covering Talisman. Yet, just by looking a few times from a distance, we were sensed. That base might have Heavenly Sovereign-level experts!"

"There are many people there, all top-tier experts... If we launch a surprise attack, I'm worried it will be very dangerous. Moreover, they are skilled in concealment and spying techniques. They might be able to see through dao fluctuations!"

Su Yu nodded. Being able to see dao fluctuations was the most terrifying. Like Su Yu, few could ambush him. A surprise attack would be a joke.

With the Heaven Gate open, he could clearly see which experts were nearby unless they cut off their dao connection. In that case, the time it took to reconnect would be enough for him to kill them!

"We're not sure to what extent their spying techniques have reached..."

Su Yu thought of something. When Ziyan died, he had collected some blood essence. Although it might not retain all memories, there should be some residual memories.

Could he glean something from it?

He hadn't checked before, partly because he was too busy, and partly because Ziyan's blood essence was mixed with that of two other Heavenly Kings, which might cause memory confusion.

Confusion or not, he still needed to check. This was an opportunity to understand the strength of the Chaos lineage.

Su Yu quickly said, "Everyone, prepare. This time, I'll lead the attack... Tongtian, find a way to send May and Full Moon back. It's good if they're here when we act; people won't think much of it."

Marquis Tongtian hurriedly nodded.

The others were a bit tense. Was this the first real confrontation with the Chaos lineage?

They didn't know the situation on the other side, and similarly, Su Yu's side didn't know much about them.

Both sides lacked sufficient intelligence on each other!

The Myriad Races, however, were in the open, and their intelligence was the most comprehensive.

Su Yu looked at Xuelan and the others, frowning slightly.

Should he bring them along for the first confrontation with the Control King's lineage?

Did these people have any connection with the Control King's lineage?

Or would they cause trouble midway or disobey orders?

However, these individuals were not weak, with two Heavenly King-level experts among them!

Not bringing them along felt like a waste.

Su Yu found himself in a dilemma. He had managed to bring these individuals back, but he wasn't sure if it was a blessing or a curse. Sometimes, having more people wasn't necessarily a good thing. These ancient figures weren't exactly paragons of virtue. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been instances of puppet Human Lords.

Su Yu was conflicted. On one hand, he wished for more powerful allies by his side. On the other hand, he worried that these people might not listen to him, potentially hindering his own forces and creating more trouble.

This time, it was a test against the Chaos Race. Wan Tiansheng had discovered their base, which otherwise would have prompted Su Yu to explore Chaos Mountain himself.

Quickly making up his mind, Su Yu declared, "This time, our goal isn't to kill the enemy but to draw out the strong experts of the Chaos Race. The more that appear, the better. Even if five or six Heavenly Sovereigns show up, that's a great outcome. Our sole objective is to attract powerful figures and, most importantly, to ensure our survival!"

He wasn't planning on killing anyone on the first attempt, nor was there a need for it. The aim was to lure out the enemy's experts, catch the attention of the myriad races, and let them know that this lineage's strength wasn't something Su Yu had fabricated.

"Marquis Huoyun, you and General Xuelan should engage in more discussions. Director Wan, let's conduct another investigation!"

Su Yu swiftly issued orders, not mentioning anything about unsealing the individuals. It was better to keep them sealed for now. He also secretly communicated with Fat Ball, "If any of them act out, swallow them immediately and then lead the others to retreat!"

Fat Ball glanced at Su Yu, wagging its tail in agreement.

Without further ado, Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng took the formation talismans and departed, tossing two ancient beast corpses to the Great Ming King to continue crafting more formation talismans.
