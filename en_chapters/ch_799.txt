Chapter 799: The Fall of a Heavenly Sovereign (Subscription Request)

Under Tiangu's leadership, the myriad races began their advance. The Immortal Race took the lead!

Sometimes, Su Yu had to admit that Tiangu possessed enough audacity. From the Lower Realm to the Upper Realm, in every great battle, the Immortal Race suffered heavy losses. Yet, they dared to fight, and through these sacrifices, they secured a voice for themselves.

This resulted in a situation where, in the Lower Realm, among the three major races, Tiangu almost always called the shots. Although not entirely unified, Tiangu had a semblance of a coalition leader.

At this moment, the myriad races, who had initially intended to wait, quickly united and began pressing into the depths of chaos.

...

In the depths of chaos.

The Kingdom of Mountains.

Outside the kingdom, there were two circles: one formed by the Chaos Dragon and its kind, and the other by Yue Hao and his group. Together, they had nine Heavenly Sovereigns, fifteen including the Heavenly Kings and several ancient beasts—a considerable force.

Moreover, at this moment, more and more chaotic ancient tribes were flying in from the depths of chaos, influenced by the chaotic will, coming to aid the Control King's lineage.

The Chaos Dragon and its companions were deeply concerned.

The myriad races were closing in!

They had thought these guys might not react so quickly, but the enemy was indeed approaching swiftly, bringing hundreds of Daofuse Realm experts with them.

At the rear of the crowd, Yue Hao was equally grave as he looked at Yue Luo and said solemnly, "The myriad races have reached a consensus so quickly!"

It was unexpected for them as well.

Previously, according to their intelligence, the internal strife among the myriad races was quite intense.

Yue Luo also glanced over there, and after a moment, said, "It's the Immortal Race! Look, the Immortal Race's experts are leading. It must be Tiangu's doing, using the Immortal Race as the vanguard to achieve unity among the myriad races!"

Tiangu!

His reputation was indeed significant. He had ruled the Immortal Realm for a hundred thousand years and was a near-invincible presence at the end of the ancient era. However, in recent years, he had been entangled with the Immortal Emperor's Great Dao, unable to break through.

With the emergence of many Heavenly Sovereigns in the Upper Realm, this Immortal Emperor had somewhat fallen behind.

Now, Tiangu had come to the Upper Realm.

Yue Luo, while observing the myriad races, also glanced in another direction where Su Yu and his group were—a formidable bunch.

Su Yu and the myriad races had a total of sixteen Heavenly Sovereign-level experts.

At this moment, Yue Luo felt the pressure and quickly said, "The Ancestor must come out to fight, or else... we might not be able to withstand them! Sun Corona, Saint Marquis, these guys are not weak, including Su Yu! I can hold off one of them, and even if you borrow the ancient beast's body, you can only hold off one... Without the Ancestor, the others can't be stopped!"

Without the Ancestor, it was clear they couldn't match the enemy.

The clan had sent out seven Heavenly Sovereigns, and with the previously slain Yue Qin, along with the Ancestor and Control Qing, the Holy Race's strength was terrifying.

Yet, at this moment, it wasn't enough!

Yue Luo sensed the crisis. Deep within the kingdom, beneath the mountains, before the Gate of Hell, Yue Zhan naturally felt it too.

At this moment, Yue Zhan's long hair fluttered, and there were several strong figures beside him, including several Heavenly Kings. However, the Heavenly Sovereign combat power had indeed all been deployed.

The clan had sent out eight Heavenly Sovereigns, yet it still wasn't enough!

This was far worse than expected.

Yue Zhan said in a deep voice, "You all, go out and assist in the battle!"

As his words fell, four Heavenly Kings beside him rose into the air without a word and quickly flew to the periphery.

At this point, the clan had deployed all seven Heavenly Sovereigns and sixteen Heavenly Kings.

Yue Zhan cursed inwardly. If Su Yu hadn't killed one of their Heavenly Sovereigns and several Heavenly Kings last time, they would have had over twenty Heavenly Kings by now.

"Senior Sister!"

Yue Zhan looked towards the gate and said solemnly, "It will take at least two more hours!"

Too slow!

Just two hours short, Yue Zhan sighed, "Bad luck, perhaps it's Su Yu, that bastard, who deprived us of our fortune!"

This luck... really wasn't good.

Just short by this little bit!

The key was that the myriad races had reached a consensus in just this short time, which didn't make sense. This luck was indeed lacking!

As soon as he said this, from within the gate, Control Qing's voice was icy, "Su Yu! This person must die!"

Audacious!

He dared to usurp the Holy Master's throne!

Even if the Holy Master didn't care, he couldn't let Su Yu take it away.

Control Qing finished speaking, her voice cold, "The chaotic ancient beasts and you are united, and can hold them off for a while. Yue Zhan... the Gate of Hell needs power to open, it needs energy! If there's really no other way... sacrifice!"

Yue Zhan said solemnly, "Sacrifice? This..."

"Obey!"

Yue Zhan was helpless, but after thinking for a moment, he still said, "It's not entirely hopeless. Rest assured, Senior Sister, we will do our best and hold them off!"

"That's best!"

Control Qing said no more. Once she emerged, she could still fight two or three top Heavenly Sovereigns, like Saint Marquis and Sun Corona together, with no problem.

And once these top Heavenly Sovereigns were dealt with, Yue Zhan could handle two or three Heavenly Sovereigns himself.

In this way, even if Su Yu and the myriad races all came out, they would eventually be killed!

...

"Stop!"

With a low shout from Tiangu, the army halted. Behind Tiangu, hundreds of Daofuse Realm experts stood, their aura shaking the heavens.

At this moment, Tiangu looked towards the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger on the periphery and said solemnly, "If you two truly wish to cooperate with us, then now is the time to set things right, join us, and together, kill the enemy! Wait for the appearance of the Master of Rules, and join forces to kill them!"

As these words fell, the four directions changed color.

Yue Hao and his group looked at the Eight-Winged Tiger and its kind with shock.

The Eight-Winged Tiger almost wanted to curse!

Beasts!

Were they selling us out?

The Eight-Winged Tiger instantly shouted, "You want to sow discord? We are summoned by the chaotic will, how could we be swayed by your words!"

Tiangu said calmly, "Your attitudes are unclear, ambiguous with us, and also ambiguous with the Sin Clan! Now, the time is right, if you two want to achieve something, cooperate now, and I will consider you allies! Together, we will destroy the Sin Clan, right here and now! If you want to fish in troubled waters... now, no one can stay out of it!"

"If you two are unwilling to join forces... then retreat now, I don't need you to act, but it's best to stay far away from us!"

The Heavenly Sovereigns present had strange looks in their eyes.

They had actually reached an agreement with the Eight-Winged Tiger and its kind, agreeing to betray at a critical moment.

But now, Tiangu seemed not to trust them and directly exposed it!

Naturally, Tiangu didn't trust them!

These two ancient beasts had very problematic attitudes.

He didn't need them to betray at a critical moment. Now, with the myriad races, chaotic ancient tribes, and Su Yu's side, they had a total of sixteen Heavenly Sovereigns, over twenty Heavenly Kings, and were sure to win against the Sin Clan!

Why leave any backhand, waiting for the other side to betray?

And then fight the ancient beasts, consuming Daofuse Realm experts, was it necessary?

Before this, he felt it wasn't necessary, but unfortunately, he didn't have the final say before.

Now, he had to force these two to show their stance.

Are they with us, or with the Sin Clan?

And this move made the Chaos Dragon and its companions look grim.

The Human Race was cunning, and it turned out the Immortal Race wasn't any better. They wanted to fish in troubled waters, but they weren't given the chance. They were forced to show their stance right away.

Before this, they had reached an agreement with the Heavenly Sovereigns to betray at a critical moment... and they decided when that critical moment was.

Before this, they just needed to play along.

The Eight-Winged Tiger cursed inwardly, all beasts!

Su Yu had previously pretended to want to kill him, and now Tiangu was doing the same, directly forcing them. At this moment... what should we do?

Tiangu continued, "I don't want to know your purpose! But before this, you promised to assist us at the necessary moment, and now... the necessary moment has arrived!"

"Eight-Winged Tiger!"

At this moment, from the rear, a strong figure from the Control King's lineage, holding a giant axe, shouted angrily, "You are summoned by the chaotic will, are you going to betray?"

If these two betrayed, it would be a big problem!

And under them, there were still a large number of ancient beasts!

...

Further back.

Su Yu smiled playfully.

Destiny Marquis sighed lightly, "Tiangu... is different from what we imagined!"

Before the battle, Tiangu actually forced the chaotic ancient tribes.

This was somewhat unexpected!

According to Destiny Marquis's thoughts, or rather, the thoughts of these people, they would fight first, and at the critical moment, when the Master of Rules appeared, they would let these two betray and give the Master of Rules a thunderous blow.

Now, everything was messed up!

Su Yu laughed, "A good decision! A wise decision! We can't rely on these two ancient beasts to really help, who knows what the situation is! Now, even if the two ancient beasts don't help, the Sin Clan will worry they have a plan! Good thing!"

He thought Tiangu's move was brilliant!

Now, the enemy was weak and they were strong, so they should use their strength to crush them head-on!

Su Yu looked over there, smiling. He wanted to see how these two ancient beasts would choose now.

...

How to choose?

Is there even a need to say?

The Eight-Winged Tiger was a scholarly tiger, a scholar, and knew how to choose.

Originally, they wanted to fish in troubled waters, but now, since they were forced... the myriad races and Su Yu's side were clearly stronger, so the choice was obvious.

The next moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger flew out, "Tiangu, is it? You fool... forget it, we originally wanted to blend in and give you more support, but you are so stupid... forget it, wasted my good intentions!"

With that, it roared, leading over ten ancient beasts, quickly flying towards the myriad races. Not only that, but the Chaos Dragon also roared and led over ten ancient beasts out.

However, there were still dozens of ancient beasts, roaring madly and struggling fiercely, not following along. Those were the ancient beasts heavily influenced by the chaotic will.

A colossal serpent-like ancient beast roared in fury, "Why? We are driven by the will of Chaos. When Chaos reigns again, this world shall return to its primordial state. Why betray us?" The serpent was seething with rage. Why indeed?

The Eight-Winged Tiger couldn't be bothered to respond. Why? Simply because no one wants to be subjugated. It's as simple as that. You think you can just command us at will? Why should we comply? The Chaos Seal has been in place for countless ages. Outside, we were the leaders. But now, even before those beings have emerged, they are already trying to control us. Once they do come out, we won't even qualify as cannon fodder. If luck isn't on our side, we might end up being devoured by creatures like the Poro Dragon Beast.

We want to be the rulers, not the ruled. It's that simple.

At this moment, Tiangu let out a small sigh of relief. As for being cursed, let them curse. At least now, the lines between friend and foe were somewhat clear. Unless these two decide to switch sides again, if they haven't reached an agreement with the Sin Clan, switching sides again would only make the Sin Clan wary of them.

"Everyone, be cautious of these two!" Tiangu transmitted a message. Then, looking at the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon, he quickly said, "Since you two are here... those twins are yours!"

Across from them, among the seven Heavenly Venerables, the twins were formidable. But the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger were also top-tier powerhouses. Tiangu entrusted them with the task, showing consideration.

The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon exchanged glances and nodded slightly.

Tiangu quickly continued, "Yue Luo and Yue Hao, our Immortal Clan will handle them! As for the remaining three, the God Clan will take one, the Demon Clan another, and the Nether, Dragon, and Phoenix Heavenly Venerables will join forces against the last one! If that one appears... I'll trouble the God Empress to hold them off for a bit. Once we've eliminated the strong foes, we'll come to assist!"

The battle with Yue Zhan was assigned to the God Empress. As for Su Yu and his group, Tiangu didn't even count them in. Not having to guard against them was already a relief! In truth, he was still wary.

The sincerity of the Immortal Clan was evident to everyone. The Dragon and Phoenix Heavenly Venerables only needed to deal with one opponent, which seemed less dangerous than expected, so no one objected.

Tiangu took a deep breath and looked at the Heavenly Kings behind him. "Heavenly King-level beings, seek out other Heavenly Kings for battle. Don't aim to kill, but make sure to hold them off! Everyone else... do the same! No retreat, no avoidance! Violators... will be executed!"

All the powerhouses felt a chill in their hearts.

Tiangu added, "Be wary of Su Yu and his group..."

With that reminder, he quickly shouted, "Attack!"

The battle erupted.

As they charged forward, Tiangu suddenly transmitted a message to a select few, "Be cautious of the Demon Clan!"

The God Empress's eyes flickered upon hearing this.

Tiangu swiftly communicated, "God Empress, refrain from joining the battle for now. If the old ancestor from the Control King's lineage truly appears, think twice before acting... Try to let Su Yu and his group engage them, and keep a close watch on the Demon Clan!"

The God Empress's expression shifted, but she remained silent.

"According to the intelligence from Su Yu's side, there might be some collusion between the Demon Clan and the Control King's lineage... Although mixed bloodlines aren't a big deal, we must be extremely cautious! If the Demon Clan betrays us, God Empress, I'll leave the Demon Clan to you!"

The issue of bloodlines had been mentioned by Su Yu, but few paid attention. Mixed bloodlines weren't unheard of. In the Human Realm, mixed blood was frowned upon, but other races were more accepting. Moreover, the mixed blood wasn't from the Demon Clan, and the Demon Clan claimed ignorance, which led many to overlook it.

Tiangu hadn't! He dared not be careless. If the two Demon Heavenly Venerables turned traitor... it would be extremely dangerous. Moreover, was it really just two Heavenly Venerables from the Demon Clan?

As far as he knew, there was another powerful Demon Clan member who hadn't joined the battle. According to the Demon Clan, that individual was in seclusion at a critical juncture. They had been informed, but the individual hadn't emerged, and there was nothing they could do.

The Saint Marquis and the Sun Corona had observed the seclusion site and confirmed it was indeed a critical moment, with the Great Dao entangled, so they didn't press further.

But Tiangu couldn't rest easy. He didn't mention it openly, fearing it might provoke the Demon Clan into rebellion. Perhaps the Demon Clan truly had no ties with the other side, but secretly, he informed the Sun Corona, the Saint Marquis, and the God Empress.

As for the others, he didn't bother notifying them. If danger arose, the God Empress and her group would react first.

"Attack!"

At this moment, Tiangu shouted again. Ahead, a large number of ancient beasts roared and charged towards Tiangu's group.

...

In the rear.

Yue Luo and the others exchanged glances. Yue Luo then shouted, "Summon the Gate of Hell!"

There was still some apprehension among them. But at this point, they couldn't avoid using the Gate of Hell. It was their clan's signature battle technique, summoning the will of a powerful being. They had been tricked by Su Yu before, but they couldn't abandon it due to past failures. When needed, it had to be used!

Moreover, Marquis Tongtian had already left.

In an instant, more portals converged. In the blink of an eye, nearly ten Gates of Hell merged, tearing through the void. A massive Gate of Hell appeared, exuding a terrifying aura!

A familiar aura, a familiar voice resonated!

"Scoundrel! I will kill you!"

The aura shook the heavens and earth. In an instant, a gigantic ancient beast appeared again, the same Poro Dragon Beast!

Previously, its will had been devoured, leaving it furious. Now, summoned by the Control King's lineage, it appeared immediately!

This time, it was even stronger than before!

Supported by ten Gates of Hell, its aura surged, reaching the level of the Saint Marquis and even surpassing it.

Ahead, Tiangu and his group were slightly taken aback.

Summoning again?

Tiangu shouted, "Saint Marquis, deal with it! This beast, our Immortal Clan will handle it!"

With these words, everyone had no objections. The Immortal Clan had previously claimed they would handle two Heavenly Venerables. Now, they were even taking on the summoned Poro Dragon Beast. What more could be said?

"Dao Heavenly Venerable, you deal with Yue Luo! Desolate Heavenly Venerable, you handle Yue Hao! Origin Saint, you and I will act when the time is right... Attack!"

Boom!

The battle erupted instantly!

On the front lines, numerous ancient beast powerhouses were slain in the blink of an eye. The Poro Dragon Beast and other powerhouses quickly joined the fray, stabilizing the battle lines. The Control King's lineage deployed various formations.

The Control King's lineage had fortified this place for many years and had their methods.

In the sky, formations appeared in an instant. Some formations were interwoven with chaotic lightning, striking down with thunderous roars. Countless bolts of lightning raged, causing Chaos Mountain to erupt in tumultuous waves!

The battle had begun!

...

"Your Majesty?"

Giant Axe and the others looked at Su Yu. The myriad races had truly made their move!

And decisively so. Even with the addition of the Poro Dragon Beast, the myriad races showed no hesitation, pressing forward immediately!

At this moment, the myriad races held an absolute advantage!

Su Yu watched for a moment, then smiled, "Let's go!"

He quickly flew towards the battlefield, bypassing the front lines, and laughed loudly, "Tiangu, don't worry about that so-called old ancestor. I'll help you keep them occupied! So you won't have to worry about me, haha, I'm not like you!"

At this moment, Su Yu flew swiftly towards the kingdom amidst the mountains.

As he approached, suddenly, layers of formations appeared around the mountains. Chains like a massive net enveloped the entire void. At the core of this net, a shadow emerged!

It resembled the shadow seated at the council center in the Luminous Domain Mansion. This was a grand formation personally set up by the Control King, sealing all directions, a defensive formation!

Giant Axe had just charged in when chains lashed out at him!

Boom!

In an instant, Giant Axe was lashed until his skin split open. Fortunately, Su Yu had arranged for Destiny to accompany him. At this moment, Destiny opened the Heavenly Eye, and in an instant, pulled Giant Axe out as the chains descended!

Once out of the formation, Giant Axe was filled with lingering fear, looking at the mountains with shock!

What was this?

Meanwhile, Su Yu looked up at the sky. The Heaven Gate opened, and he saw the presence of that shadow. It should be some remnant will of the Control King, constructing this grand formation. This lineage still had such a powerful defensive formation!

It's a pity the Great Ming King isn't here; otherwise, he could study it.

At this moment, the God Empress and her group also sensed it. The God Empress coughed and quickly said, "That's the Eight Domain Heaven-Locking Formation! Eight main chains form the entire formation, possessing extremely strong offensive and defensive capabilities..."

The God Empress hadn't joined the battle. Seeing the situation, she quickly informed Su Yu.

...

"Eight Domain Heaven-Locking Formation?"

Su Yu murmured. The formation wasn't weak.

It could be broken, but breaking it might cause some trouble.

Su Yu smiled, "You won't let me in? Then I... won't go in!"

"Attack!"

Su Yu no longer attempted a direct assault. Instead, he quickly flew towards the distant battlefield. From afar, he punched out and shouted, "This corner is ours, myriad races, retreat!"

The Daofuse experts of the myriad races retreated one after another.

At this moment, on Su Yu's side, six Heavenly Venerables joined the battle.

Boom!

A top-tier Daofuse expert from the Control King's lineage also punched out, filled with despair and rage, charging at Su Yu. Just as they approached, boom!

Six Heavenly Venerables attacked simultaneously. At this moment, no one spoke of honor.

It was simply a slaughter!

In an instant, this top-tier existence was directly blown apart!

Six Heavenly Venerables attacking a second-tier Daofuse... it was truly like slaughtering a chicken.

Su Yu quickly said, "Don't kill them outright. Destiny, you trap them. Fat Ball, you devour them. I'll strip away the power of the Great Dao!"

"Alright!"

A group of people quickly joined the battle in this corner.

Boom!

Fireworks continuously erupted. One Daofuse expert after another fell. Here, all participants were Daofuse, dying like dogs.

At this moment, deep within the mountains, Yue Zhan's voice rose again, shouting, "Eternals of the clan, join the battle!"

In an instant, amidst the mountains, hundreds of Eternals soared into the sky, each carrying a sense of despair and a determination to fight to the death. Even the powerful figures like Yue Hao did not retreat into the grand formation. If they retreated now, the formation would soon be breached and unable to withstand so many powerful opponents.

"Kill!"

At this moment, the lineage of the Control King was also driven to madness. A powerful figure wielding an axe was surrounded by the three great Heavenly Venerables of the Dragon and Phoenix races. With a furious roar, he brandished his giant axe, his combat strength surging to its peak. Despite coughing up blood, he fought with a frenzied determination. There was no retreat possible now!

On the side of the Demon Race, two great Heavenly Venerables surrounded the white-haired elder who had been injured when the Gate of Hell exploded. Despite his injuries, the white-haired elder's combat strength remained formidable, holding his ground against two opponents.

However, the lineage of the Control King was falling into a disadvantage. Only the projection of the Dragon Beast managed to suppress the Saint Marquis, putting immense pressure on the Immortal Race. Meanwhile, on the side of the God Race, the Sun Corona and Moon Heavenly Venerables joined forces to suppress a sword-wielding woman, forcing her to retreat while spitting blood. The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger also suppressed two twins.

The white-haired elder surveyed the battlefield with a look of desolation. The Saint Race was incredibly powerful, yet they couldn't withstand the combined assault of three factions. Moreover, their ancestor had yet to join the battle, and the Supreme Control King had not returned. The white-haired elder sighed deeply.

Across from him, the Heavenly Venerable Mo and Demon Heaven were equally solemn, continuously suppressing the white-haired elder. The battle was fierce, with casualties on both sides. Many ancient beasts had fallen, and the myriad races' Daofuse cultivators were also perishing.

What was even more concerning was that on Su Yu's side, the six great Heavenly Venerables were rapidly slaughtering Daofuse cultivators. In the blink of an eye, they had already slain over ten Daofuse cultivators on the spot!

A large number of Eternals, driven by a reckless abandon, flew towards Su Yu's side like moths to a flame, yet they did so without hesitation. This was also about defending their homeland. Behind them lay their nation.

Su Yu continued to kill these people. For him, it wasn't particularly difficult, and the threat was minimal. Some even self-destructed, but they couldn't harm him. One had to admit, when the myriad races went berserk, their deterrent power was immense, truly suppressing the opposition.

At that moment, the axe-wielding powerhouse was on the verge of collapse, his bones shattered by a tail strike from the Dragon Heavenly Venerable. Just then, a powerful aura erupted from the depths.

Yue Zhan couldn't hold back any longer!

In an instant, Yue Zhan shattered the void, and a fist emerged from the void, striking towards the Dragon Heavenly Venerable. Su Yu initially intended to intervene, but seeing that Yue Zhan was targeting the Dragon Heavenly Venerable, he refrained.

Boom!

With a loud explosion, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable was sent flying. On the other side, just as the Divine Empress was about to act, the Sun Corona shouted, "I'll handle him!" He abandoned the Moon Heavenly Venerable and swiftly charged towards the emerging Yue Zhan.

He couldn't let the Empress join the battle; if she did, she would surely die once the battle concluded. Meanwhile, Su Yu, seeing the situation, wasted no time and swiftly broke through the void, charging towards the opponent of the Moon Heavenly Venerable, the sword-wielding woman.

Both the Moon Heavenly Venerable and the sword-wielding woman were startled, fearing that Su Yu would target them. However, Su Yu's massive palm descended, aiming directly at the woman. In the blink of an eye, March, Giant Axe, and Thunderstorm joined the fray!

The sword-wielding woman wore a look of despair. There were too many of them! Such strength could contend with a ruler of laws, let alone her! The Moon Heavenly Venerable secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, they weren't targeting him!

The sword-wielding woman, seeing Su Yu and his allies approaching, realized that her ancestor was being held back by the Sun Corona, and her allies were all engaged with formidable foes, unable to assist her. Despair filled her eyes, quickly turning to resolve.

She glanced at the Moon Heavenly Venerable, who was still entangled with her, and the Moon Heavenly Venerable's heart sank. But it was too late!

Boom!

A thunderous explosion echoed throughout the Upper Realm! The explosion shattered Su Yu's descending palm, and the sword-wielding woman, with resolute determination, unleashed the decisiveness of a Heavenly Venerable at its fullest!

I will die! But even in death, I will ensure a victory.

Boom!

The deafening explosion spread, and nearby, seven or eight Daofuse cultivators, regardless of friend or foe, were instantly blown to pieces, perishing in an instant! Not only that, but the Moon Heavenly Venerable, closest to her, was torn apart by the explosion, his Great Dao trembling. He wanted to escape, but it was too late, too fast!

Su Yu arrived quickly, and the woman's self-destruction was equally swift. Not only her Great Dao but her physical body and sea of will were all detonated. She understood that with Su Yu and his allies present, even if her sea of will remained, she couldn't escape. With a single self-destruction, everything was obliterated!

A Heavenly Venerable detonated the entire power of the Great Dao, and the violent explosion suppressed everything! The Moon Heavenly Venerable was blown to pieces, his sea of will exposed. At that moment, from afar, the Divine Empress swiftly reached out and grabbed the sea of will, pulling it back!

Su Yu seemed to have no intention of saving anyone! Indeed, after being caught in the explosion, Su Yu immediately withdrew, showing no concern for the Moon Heavenly Venerable's fate! It was the Divine Empress who sensed the danger and quickly retrieved the Moon Heavenly Venerable's sea of will, though her arm was slightly damaged by the powerful explosion.

A Heavenly Venerable's self-destruction! This was the first time. Despite several self-destructions of physical bodies and Great Daos on Su Yu's side, no Heavenly Venerable had self-destructed before. Previously, when two Heavenly Kings self-destructed their Great Daos, they had blown a top-tier Heavenly Venerable to pieces!

Let alone a Heavenly Venerable!

If Su Yu hadn't blocked part of it, and if the Divine Empress hadn't pulled away the Moon Heavenly Venerable's sea of will, the Moon Heavenly Venerable would have been killed by the explosion!

"Sword Servant!"

At this moment, the powerhouses of the Control King's lineage roared in fury! Dead! This was the second Heavenly Venerable to die in battle since they emerged from seclusion. The first was killed by Su Yu and his allies, an unexpected death, but today, it wasn't unexpected. If this continued, they might all die!

And the death of this Heavenly Venerable was also related to Su Yu! If he hadn't intervened, the Sword Servant wouldn't have despaired, wouldn't have self-destructed. The Moon Heavenly Venerable alone couldn't have taken her down!

In that instant, the Control King's lineage directed their hateful gazes at Su Yu! It was all because of this beast! Today, the first Heavenly Venerable had fallen in battle, too quickly!

Boom!

Another loud explosion echoed as the Sun Corona was sent flying, his skin torn and flesh split by Yue Zhan's punch! Yue Zhan's aura was now violently raging!

His long hair fluttered as he coldly glared at Su Yu, his voice icy, "Su Yu, you're courting death!"

Su Yu looked innocent, "It wasn't me who killed her!" How innocent I am! She self-destructed, and besides, the myriad races are killing your people. We're just killing a few Daofuse cultivators. Why are you targeting me?

"Die!"

He suddenly roared, and the Gate of Hell appeared. This Gate of Hell wasn't meant to kill but to trap the enemy. In an instant, it enveloped the Sun Corona, and the next moment, Yue Zhan swung his fist towards Su Yu!

Kill Su Yu!

The powerful burst of energy intimidated the heavens and earth! Su Yu's side was slightly solemn, but he wasn't truly afraid. There were six Heavenly Venerables here! Yue Zhan had trapped the Sun Corona, facing seven Heavenly Venerables alone. Even if he were a true ruler of laws, it wouldn't be enough!

Unless he was of the top-tier kind!

The Divine Empress hesitated, wanting to intervene but ultimately refrained. Su Yu's side could handle it, but if she intervened, she might easily fall. On the side of the God Race, the Moon Heavenly Venerable was severely injured, and the Sun Corona was trapped. However, their previously determined formidable foe had self-destructed. Unless something unexpected happened, the God Race wouldn't need to pay any more price in this battle.

And at that moment, as Yue Zhan erupted to his peak, his voice overshadowing everything, the situation changed once more. The Divine Empress's expression shifted, and she quickly turned her head to look into the distance. Then, disregarding the risk of falling in battle, she swiftly turned and struck!

Behind her, a presence filled with demonic energy suddenly appeared! It was a woman, a female demon! Incredibly powerful! Her purple hair fluttered as she wielded a ball of thunderous power, punching towards the Divine Empress.

Further away, the Heavenly Venerable Mo and Demon Heaven instantly joined forces with the white-haired elder, and the three powerful figures charged towards the Dragon Heavenly Venerable, who had been sent flying by a punch!

At this moment, Tiangu and the Origin Saint Marquis also attacked together, targeting the axe-wielding powerhouse! The Demon Race had betrayed them!

Tiangu had been worried about this, and now it had truly happened. He had warned the Divine Empress, but she was blocked by a top-tier demon powerhouse who suddenly attacked!

Tiangu chose not to rescue the Dragon Heavenly Venerable but instead took advantage of the axe-wielding powerhouse's severe injuries, leading the Origin Saint and Nether Heavenly Venerable to kill the axe-wielding powerhouse!

A trade-off!

This was Tiangu's intention. Rescue... after all, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable wasn't one of their own.

Everything happened too quickly. So quickly, it was unbelievable! The Dragon Heavenly Venerable's face was filled with horror. He had just been sent flying by Yue Zhan's punch, severely injured. Now, three powerful figures were charging at him, and he was terrified, letting out a desperate cry, "Save me!"

Someone could save him! Tiangu's side could, and nearby, Giant Axe and Destiny weren't far away, including Fat Ball, who could save him! But... no one saved him! Yes, no one saved him. Everyone coldly watched or continued fighting, not caring about his life or death.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Four consecutive loud explosions echoed. On one side, it was Su Yu and Yue Zhan, on another, the Divine Empress and the demon woman, on yet another, Tiangu and his allies against the axe-wielding powerhouse, and finally, the Heavenly Venerable Mo and his allies against the Dragon Heavenly Venerable!

The four massive explosions instantly caused some weaker individuals to vomit blood, and nearby Eternals were directly blown apart!

In that instant, Su Yu retreated, Yue Zhan staggered, but Su Yu's side had more than one person. The Divine Empress struck back the demon woman, while on the other side, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable was torn apart by the three Daofuse cultivators, and similarly, the axe-wielding giant was torn apart by the Origin Saint and his allies!

Both sides' seas of will appeared almost simultaneously! This scene changed too quickly, so quickly that others barely reacted before the bodies of two Heavenly Venerables were shattered.

"Swallow Heaven!"

A thunderous roar echoed across the heavens and earth. At that moment, a colossal mouth appeared above everyone, and with a deafening boom, it began to wildly inhale, instantly swallowing two seas of will!

It was Fat Ball!

Fat Ball, acting on Su Yu's command, had crazily absorbed the seas of will of two Heavenly Venerables in one swift move.

In the blink of an eye, all eyes turned to Su Yu.

Su Yu, meanwhile, was being sent flying by the Control King Ancestor's strike. He grabbed Fat Ball and turned to flee with his people.

Two Heavenly Venerables' seas of will... I'll take them!

No matter who you are!

This sudden turn of events caused the entire battlefield to fall silent for a moment. In the blink of an eye, the four Heavenly Venerables, including the Sword Servant and Moon Heavenly Venerable, were either dead or incapacitated.

It was too fast!
