Chapter 821: Unworthy! (Please Subscribe)

In the rear.

At this moment, Su Yu resembled a villain, hunting down a protagonist of destiny, slaughtering the loyal followers who stood in his way. In truth, Su Yu never considered himself a good person. In this era, who could truly be called a good person? Who was the villain? Everyone had their own goals and stances. One's hero could be another's enemy.

To people like Chang Mei and Chang Qing, Su Yu was the greatest villain. As for Su Yu, he held no particular grudge against them. As Chang Mei had said, everyone served their own masters. It was just that their master wasn't strong enough.

After integrating with the Book of Time, Su Yu's strength in his own world was roughly equivalent to a third-tier ruler of laws. All those rulers of laws had merged their paths into the world, and Su Yu's strength surged once more, perhaps nearing the second tier. Of course, the stronger one became, the harder it was to improve.

However, with the Human Emperor's world augmenting him, Su Yu might have truly reached the second tier in this realm. Of course, this was only temporary. After all, the Human Emperor's world belonged to the Human Emperor.

But at this moment, Su Yu was indeed incredibly powerful! Borrowing strength had always been Su Yu's strategy, from leveraging the Book of Time in the past to now drawing upon the Human Emperor's Great Dao. Su Yu saw nothing wrong with it. When one's strength was insufficient, borrowing power was also a skill!

That Yu wasn't weak. He was probably on par with the Martial Emperor! In ancient times, he would have been a top-tier existence. But now, with Su Yu using his own world as a foundation, integrating multiple rulers of laws, merging with the Book of Time, and receiving the Human Emperor's augmentation, his strength was terrifying!

At this moment, his world expanded, continuing the pursuit! Once outside his own world, things would become difficult!

If Su Yu truly left his world, he would lose the augmentation of the Human Emperor's power and his own world's enhancement. In that case, his strength would rapidly decline, possibly dropping to a weaker third-tier level. In such a scenario, he could only contend with Hundred Battle King, and while he might defeat him, he would surely lose against Yu.

Only within this world was Su Yu the strongest in the Myriad Realms!

"If I don't resolve these troubles today, they'll only multiply..."

Su Yu murmured, and in the next moment, he silently chanted. Boom!

In the distance, Lei Bao, who was being dragged away by Hundred Battle King and the others, suddenly had a surge of thunder power erupt from within him. With a bang, the thunder power exploded, causing Hundred Battle King to stagger.

Lei Bao spat out blood, his face filled with sorrow. He looked back at Su Yu and sighed, "Emperor Yu... what a calculation!"

Inside him, there was a thunder power that didn't belong to him, and it suddenly erupted!

He realized when it had appeared. Last time, when dealing with Yue Hao, Su Yu had collaborated with March and Lei Bao. In Su Yu's world projection, Su Yu had infused him with a lot of thunder power to help kill Yue Hao. Afterward, Lei Bao had checked himself and found nothing wrong.

But now, today, he discovered that a large amount of thunder power, originating from Su Yu's world, had been lurking within him.

At this moment, this thunder power exploded, severely injuring him and even implicating Hundred Battle King, causing him to stagger.

Behind them, Su Yu's face was calm. "My enemies will never gain any advantage from me. Knowing you were Hundred Battle King's man, how could I not prepare?"

It was such a normal thing!

Last time, when Lei Bao entered his world, Su Yu had bestowed a lot of thunder power. In such a situation, how could he not restrict this person? The opportunity was rare, and of course, he had to restrict him!

Lei Bao was bitter!

Su Yu!

A terrifying guy!

Not only terrifying but also ruthless. That day, he was still Su Yu's ally, yet Su Yu had already started plotting against him.

Lei Bao was severely injured by the explosion. Moreover, at this moment, a large amount of thunder power in the void was sweeping towards him, constantly erupting with the thunder power within him, showing signs of losing control.

Lei Bao sighed, suddenly shaking off Hundred Battle King's grip.

Hundred Battle King, who had just been staggered by the explosion, was slightly stunned. Lei Bao sighed, "Your Majesty, go first! Whether it's the Holy Mother or Your Majesty, both are the hope of the Giant Race... Here, Su Yu is unbeatable! Let me buy you some time!"

He broke free from Hundred Battle King and flew towards Su Yu. Not only him, but at this moment, Yue Luo suddenly broke away from Hundred Battle King and quickly flew towards Lei Bao.

Hundred Battle King's face changed.

Yue Luo's laughter echoed, carrying a seductive tone, "Holy Mother and Your Majesty, leave the world first. Lei Bao and I will join forces to fight him. Even if Su Yu is strong, it will take time to kill us, enough for you two to leave this place!"

Two rulers of laws were going to hold the rear for them.

Hundred Battle King's expression fluctuated as he looked at Yu. "Join forces to fight Su Yu, there's still hope!"

If they hadn't fled at the start, with Chang Qing and Chang Mei still around, there might have been more hope.

But even now, as long as Yu was willing to make a move, there was still hope!

Yu was indeed very strong!

Yu's face was cold as he continued flying towards the edge of the world. Su Yu's world now almost covered the Upper Realm, the area was vast, and they were suppressed within his world.

Their flying speed wasn't very fast!

There was still some distance to the area not covered by Su Yu.

Upon hearing this, Yu's eyes turned cold as he looked at Hundred Battle King, transmitting his voice while flying, "Foolish! Once outside, if Su Yu dares to come out, I'll kill him alone! Here, insisting on a death battle with him, are you an idiot?"

From a pros and cons perspective, indeed, fighting Su Yu outside was more cost-effective.

Fighting him within Su Yu's world was giving Su Yu all the advantages of time, place, and people.

Using their weakest state to fight Su Yu's strongest state was extremely unwise!

"While Yue Luo and Lei Bao can entangle him, we must retreat immediately!"

Yu glanced back, almost there, no big problem.

These two were also rulers of laws, enough to delay Su Yu for a while. If outside, Su Yu wouldn't be able to easily kill rulers of laws, but here, he could suppress two rulers of laws, weaken their strength, and strengthen his own. The gap between them would widen.

At that time, killing the two would be much easier.

Not only that, Yu thrust his spear, shattering the void. "If you want to delay longer, you and I should bombard his world, depleting his strength. It's better than fighting him to the death now!"

Yu's choice wasn't wrong either.

In this way, they could definitely leave Su Yu's world. At that time, moving Su Yu's world wouldn't be so easy. Last time, moving from Chaos to Ren Mountain took Su Yu seven days.

At this moment, wanting to run with the world, without a place like Chaos, such as entering the Myriad Realms, Su Yu's world would be repelled.

At that time, if Su Yu didn't come out, so be it. They could reach a balance.

If he came out, Yu was confident he could defeat Su Yu!

Hundred Battle King remained silent.

And at this moment, Yue Xiao suddenly shouted, breaking free from Hundred Battle King's grip, stunning him once more.

Yue Xiao, with white hair, was only a Heavenly Venerable, not very strong at this moment.

But he still quickly broke free from Hundred Battle King!

Without looking back, he quickly flew towards Yue Luo!

Hundred Battle King reached out, and the retreating Yue Xiao suddenly spoke with a smile, "A Luo, brother is here to save you!"

Brother!

Over there, Yue Luo, who was flying towards Su Yu, paused, turned her head, and suddenly showed a trace of sorrow in her eyes, "You... go back!"

"A Luo!"

Yue Xiao laughed heartily, "It's brother's fault for letting you be bullied all this time. Today, you and I, siblings, will fight together. Even if we die, brother will die before you!"

He didn't hesitate, quickly chasing after them!

In the distance, Su Yu's expression was calm as he continued to pursue them, saying indifferently, "What a touching sibling bond, what a noble sacrifice for one's master! I'm envious!"

No matter how deep the enemy's feelings, they were still enemies!

If I were defeated, I wouldn't fare any better than them.

Perhaps even worse!

Su Yu quickly suppressed the slight ripple in his heart.

If I were to die in battle, I wouldn't be alone. Everyone who merged into my world might die.

I bear more!

They trust me. At my command, everyone merged their paths into mine. If I were to abandon killing the enemy due to some thoughts, it would be cruel to myself and to my comrades.

Su Yu's heart instantly calmed, turning cold.

Just like when he killed Marquis Yunshui, he knew Marquis Yunshui might have regretted it later, but... he couldn't leave any potential threats. Even a second-tier marquis could lead to an irreversible disaster!

Never underestimate the enemy!

Su Yu never underestimated his opponents, even if they seemed foolish. Even now, with the Myriad Races' five rulers of laws besieging Control Qing and Yue Zhan, Su Yu remained cautious, never letting his guard down!

Trusting the enemy to keep their word?

Trusting the enemy to be merciful?

That's nonsense!

Today, I am the victor. If I were defeated, I'd be worse off than them!

...

Su Yu was about to catch up with Yue Luo and the others.

And at this moment, Hundred Battle King, who had been fleeing, suddenly paused. Beside him, Yu, who was still flying, didn't pay attention to him. Just as she was about to continue flying, suddenly, the stars shifted, and her vision blurred!

Hundred Battle King's 720 acupoints appeared, and one of them suddenly shattered, forcibly shifting the void!

In the blink of an eye, Hundred Battle King and Yu appeared beside Yue Luo and the others.

"Hundred Battle King!"

A thunderous roar echoed through the heavens.

Yu's aura erupted to the extreme, looking coldly at Hundred Battle King!

At this moment, Hundred Battle King was no longer fearful or afraid. His expression was calm, as if he had returned to the past, speaking calmly, "We can't escape now. Getting angry at me is useless! Better think about how to join forces to fight Su Yu! Or do you want to attack me and let Su Yu take advantage?"

At this moment, he seemed to have become the Human Lord who once swept across the world, looking at Su Yu approaching from the opposite side, smiling, "Su Yu, you're... really young!"

Envy!

Beside him, Yu's face was ashen. In the next moment, the Human Gate appeared, as if she wanted to escape again. However, the Human Gate of Hundred Battle also appeared instantly, suppressing the void and leaving her no chance to use her own gate.

"Yu!" Hundred Battle said calmly, "If you want to escape, the only path is death! If we join forces, there's still a chance! If we don't fight... there's only a dead end! If you want to flee, I'll join forces with Su Yu and kill you first!"

"You dare!" Yu shouted angrily, her voice filled with fury and pressure. "Zhou Qi, are you rebelling?"

Hundred Battle replied calmly, "Not at all! Since we've come this far, changing course would be even more foolish! We've already become rebels; rebelling again would be a disservice to our fallen brothers. There's only one path left, and that's to fight him with me!"

Yu's face turned even more ashen. "Fool! I told you, once we're out, he won't be able to defeat us!"

She was furious! They could have escaped. Once outside, Su Yu wouldn't be able to defeat them. This fool had chosen this moment to act stupidly!

Hundred Battle smiled faintly, "How do you know he won't be able to deal with us once we're out? Su Yu hasn't been famous for long, yet in such a short time, he's achieved such brilliance. How much do you and I truly understand about the power of the Heaven Opener? Don't always judge him based on your assumptions!"

Hundred Battle looked at Su Yu across from him and smiled, "I've always underestimated you. Even knowing you might have opened the heavens, I thought your heaven-opening with such weak power was laughable... But now, I see I've been a frog in a well!"

Hundred Battle sighed, "As you said, although I'm much older than you, my experiences may not be as many as yours."

"I don't think I've ever truly felt despair... Today, I might get a taste of it."

Hundred Battle laughed, "Today, I realized that compared to fear, the greatest despair is even more terrifying and hopeless!"

He laughed, "Back then, I feared Yu. Today, your appearance has shattered my fear of her!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Is what Long Brow said true? Were you really intimidated by a woman who's merely at the Martial Emperor level? If so, what kind of Human Lord are you? A mere Martial Emperor, a mere Yu, in the early ancient times, was only a third-tier existence! If you fear even her, how do you plan to fight those powerful enemies of chaos and the Heaven Gate?"

Just a relatively weak second-tier ruler of laws!

Yes, Su Yu was now out of the Luminous Domain Mansion, and even third-tier was difficult for him.

Indeed, he wasn't as strong as her!

But Su Yu had never been afraid, let alone terrified. In his eyes, such figures were merely ancient remnants clinging to life!

They might be strong now, but what are they?

When Su Yu first entered the Luminous Domain Mansion, he didn't know the strength of a Martial Emperor, but he knew they were immensely powerful. A casual roar could shatter an Eternal.

At that time, Su Yu didn't even have Eternal strength!

The power of a Martial Emperor was like a deity, capable of anything, able to kill him with a breath. Su Yu was afraid, but not terrified.

He feared the strong but wasn't terrified of them!

Hundred Battle, the ninth-generation Human Lord, the first in ten thousand years, was actually intimidated by a Yu?

Incredible!

Hundred Battle smiled self-deprecatingly and nodded slightly, "A mere Yu wouldn't make me this fearful... I... saw the projection of the Human Ancestor!"

Beside him, Yu's face changed drastically!

Hundred Battle ignored her and laughed, "Do you know how terrified I was when I saw that scene? Unbelievably terrifying! Even thinking about it today makes me break out in a cold sweat!"

"With a wave of his hand, realms were destroyed, and with another, great paths were severed! The strength of the Human Ancestor is beyond imagination! I asked some people if anyone in ancient times could do that. They all said no... Not even the Culture King or the Human Emperor had witnessed such a scene!"

Hundred Battle sighed, "Such a powerful Human Ancestor, yet his opponent was equally strong, too powerful! So powerful it made me despair! Thus, Yu's appearance gave me a glimmer of hope... If the Human Ancestor could come out early, maybe these troubles could be resolved!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Who was the Human Ancestor's opponent?"

"Unnameable!" Hundred Battle laughed, and Su Yu laughed too, "What nonsense is unnameable! Fine, I won't ask! The Human Ancestor is strong, and if he can't win, that's his business. Seeing these things made you despair, intimidated you?"

"Sort of."

Hundred Battle nodded slightly, "Actually, it's not just that. When I learned that the lineage of the Control King was also part of the Human Ancestor's faction, and that Yu was too, and that some ancient marquises were as well... I felt it was insurmountable!"

"You're quite useless!"

Su Yu laughed, "I'm not mocking you, but no matter how strong these people are, so what? Now, it's our world! Just like I know the Human Emperor is strong, the Culture King is strong, the Master of Time is strong... So what? They're not here, and here, I call the shots! When they truly return, when they truly appear, whether to be a grandson or a son, whether to beg for mercy or be wiped out with a wave, that's a matter for the future!"

Su Yu's smile was radiant, "I'm not afraid of their strength. At this moment, I'm the grandpa! Even if I shout that they're all grandsons, what can they do?"

I know they're formidable!

The Master of Time, without a doubt, is a terrifyingly powerful existence.

But... I still pluck his wool!

He's not here!

If you're capable, come back!

When you return, if I need to admit defeat, I will, but if you're not here, should I wet my pants just because I saw your projection?

If the Lord of the Undead appeared, should I have committed suicide? I've thoroughly offended the Lord of the Undead!

Hundred Battle smiled bitterly, "Maybe you're right! Maybe you and I are really different! Maybe I've had it too easy! From a young age, I was incredibly talented, winning every battle, never experiencing defeat... Yet, one defeat, and I couldn't recover!"

He laughed self-deprecatingly, "So, it's hard for me to experience your feelings, and it's hard for you to experience mine!"

Hundred Battle, undefeated!

But the moment he saw Yu, he was mentally and physically struck, suffering multiple blows, and his spirit was defeated. One defeat was too much for him!

Some people can rise again, but some find it hard to recover.

Hundred Battle, for so many years, never recovered. Today, speaking candidly about it all, he had finally moved on.

However... it was too late!

Su Yu sighed, "What a pity! I see you now, and there's not much fear or terror in you!"

"Yes, because I said, the best way to suppress fear is with greater despair and terror!"

Hundred Battle laughed, "And all of this... is thanks to you!"

"I'm not as strong as the Human Ancestor!"

"But... you can kill me... can't you?"

Hundred Battle sighed, "You killed Long Brow, killed Evergreen, and now you want to kill Thunderstorm, kill Moon Luo... Su Yu, they were all my comrades!"

Su Yu nodded, looking at him, then at the furious Yu, and laughed, "Why not join forces to kill Yu first?"

Hundred Battle laughed, "You have quite a few tricks up your sleeve, still trying to gain an advantage at this moment! Killing Yu would mean our deaths! I may hate her, but not enough to kill her... I can only blame myself for my lack of resolve. It's my fault, and now I need her help to deal with you. How could I turn against her?"

Su Yu laughed, "Yu, join forces to kill Hundred Battle, and I promise you can leave! If he doesn't die now, even if he wins against me outside, he'll turn against you. If you have any brains, you should understand!"

Yu's face changed slightly!

Hundred Battle's expression also shifted, "Su Yu..."

Su Yu smiled sinisterly, "What's wrong? Hundred Battle, do you think a fair fight is my way of respecting you? No, no, no, you're a traitor! Do you know how many people have fallen because of you?"

"If it weren't for your abandonment six thousand years ago, the Human Race wouldn't have lost so many people!"

"Hundred Battle, you've caused too many deaths, and now you want me to treat you like a hero... that's impossible!"

Su Yu's voice thundered, shaking the heavens, "You're a traitor, a sinner! You're a disgrace to the Human Race! Because of you, the Human Race's victorious momentum was wiped out in an instant!"

"Because of you, the Torchbearer lineage was nearly wiped out, and the Human Race's heritage almost completely destroyed!"

"Because of you, we've fought for five hundred years, countless people dying in battle!"

"Because of you, we couldn't physically merge with the Dao, stuck at Eternal!"

"Because of you, the Human Race was torn apart, ancient remnants dying in battle, ninety-nine percent wiped out!"

"Because of you, our allies were either destroyed or declined!"

Su Yu seemed to be sentencing him, his voice echoing through the heavens, "Now you awaken and want me to treat you like a hero? Ridiculous! Moreover, you're not truly awakened. If you were, you'd kill Yu instead of joining forces with them to fight me!"

"Hundred Battle, you're a hypocrite, pretending to be a saint, pretending to be a gentleman!"

"What kind of treatment do you want from me? What kind of courtesy? You're a traitor, a sinner, a disgrace, and you still want me to treat you well?"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Ridiculous! If you fought me one-on-one, I'd still respect you a bit. Though a sinner, you'd at least have some integrity! Now you're teaming up with your so-called enemy to fight me, the rightful Human Lord. What do you want from me?"

"I... am the hero!"

Su Yu's voice was cold, "I am the hero of this era, and you want to kill me, yet still want to be remembered as a hero? No, you're destined to be a disgrace, never forgotten, always remembered as the ninth-generation Human Lord, a traitor, a sinner!"

Hundred Battle's face turned pale.

Below the heavens, the Great Zhou King and others were slightly stunned.

When Hundred Battle returned, when he said he would fight Su Yu, Red Moon and Blood Shadow indeed had some psychological changes. The emperor... seemed to have returned!

When Su Yu, without any ceremony, loudly pronounced judgment upon him, everyone was stunned!

Today, due to Su Yu's overwhelming presence, many things seemed to have been overlooked. But now, with Su Yu's words, everyone suddenly realized—Hundred Battle... would not return!

No matter what he did now, some facts could not be changed. Wrong was wrong. It wasn't something that could be undone with a mere admission of guilt. He was a criminal! Because of him, the Human Race had fallen to its lowest point during this tide! Because of him, the Human Race had suffered heavy losses, struggling time and again to survive.

Red Moon and the others turned pale, lowering their heads in silence. According to Su Yu's words... they were criminals too.

...

In the midst of heaven and earth, Su Yu's aura surged with cold indifference. "The weak have always been pitied! Even if they make mistakes, some will say, 'To err is human.' But mistakes have their degrees! Hundred Battle, if you were merely cowardly, perhaps you could be forgiven! But you are not! You took everything the Human Emperor and others entrusted to you, you killed the Human Emperor's contingency plans, you destroyed the Torchbearer lineage... You are more detestable than the myriad races, more deserving of death!"

"I never thought the myriad races were wrong in our conflict! If I were in their shoes, and the Immortal Race wanted to unify the Human Race and make us slaves, I would resist too. It's a war of races, survival of the fittest!"

"If I'm ruthless, they are weak!"

"If they are ruthless, we suffer, it's that simple!"

Su Yu's voice was icy. "You are different! Hundred Battle, you are a hundred thousand times more detestable than them! Against the myriad races, I can simply kill without reasoning! But with you, I must speak, I must let everyone know, you are a criminal, not a hero! You are the Human Lord, the master of the Human Race, yet you betrayed your own country, your own home, your own race!"

"Someone like you wants to leave a good name before dying? Wants future generations to remember the Ninth Generation Human Lord as a hero who awakened at the last moment... Ridiculous! Don't delude yourself! As long as I, Su Yu, live, you will be the greatest traitor! I will engrave everything about you in the River of Time, the Celestial River of Death, the Land of Dao Origin, my world, and all the books!"

"I want you to be infamous for eternity, so future generations remember that someone like you doesn't deserve any good name!"

Hundred Battle's face turned pale instantly! At this moment, Su Yu's aura completely overwhelmed him! When he thought he had awakened, when he thought perhaps he wasn't so guilty, Su Yu told him no, you are more guilty than anyone!

You are the greatest traitor!

Su Yu didn't even treat the Control King this way, merely stripping him of his title. He didn't treat the myriad races this way, merely killing them. He didn't have much hatred for Yu, but for him... he was filled with deep hatred!

It was truly deep hatred!

At this moment, Su Yu's voice rose again, "I originally thought you had some hidden reasons! If you hadn't allied with the Sin Race, I would have thought you were just waiting for an opportunity. In that case, you wouldn't be a good person, but you would be a hero!"

"You just had a different inclination, preferring to preserve the elite and create greater achievements... At that time, in my eyes, you were still a person! I wasn't satisfied with your choice, but if your choice could defeat the myriad races and the Sin Race, then you would be a hero, a figure like a hero!"

"But now... when I learned you were in league with the Sin Race! Your purpose was merely to bring back the Human Ancestor, and the reason was just fear... Hundred Battle, you are a complete waste!"

Su Yu's words were piercing!

Indeed, when Hundred Battle first appeared, Su Yu guessed some of his intentions, thinking that although Hundred Battle was ruthless, he was also a hero waiting for an opportunity to create greater achievements!

Su Yu was dissatisfied, but he didn't hate him, just thought Hundred Battle's choice was different from his own.

But today, with everything exposed, Su Yu suddenly felt only anger, resentment, ridicule, and disdain!

So, he left Hundred Battle no dignity, because he didn't deserve it!

Opposite him, Hundred Battle's face turned pale.

And Yu, too, showed a faint hint of mockery.

Is this the result of your staying behind?

The result is that Su Yu doesn't see you as a hero for staying behind, only as foolish, only as an idiot!

Yu spoke at this moment, with a faint smile, "Su Yu, you are indeed different from others..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, "You dog, you'd better shut up! Intimidating the Ninth Generation Human Lord, inciting him to betray, you are also unforgivable! You are guilty as Hundred Battle! Of course, you are not a traitor because you are not of my race! For an enemy like you, beheading is enough! Hundred Battle is qualified to be infamous for eternity, but trash like you doesn't deserve any mention in the history of the Human Race!"

Yu's face changed slightly.

Su Yu's words were truly venomous!

And at this moment, as he spoke, Su Yu's myriad paths converged, his aura suddenly surged, carrying a cold indifference, "Since you foolishly chose not to flee, then die!"

"I am the Emperor, the universe is under my control!"

Boom!

Heaven and earth compressed, instantly shrinking!

Su Yu's aura grew even stronger!

Yu's face changed, cursing angrily, "Kill him!"

Since this idiot Hundred Battle chose to stay, then he must be killed!

What are you waiting for?

Boom!

A long spear, combined with 720 physical acupoints, erupted with infinitely powerful power of laws, breaking through the void with a single strike!

And Hundred Battle and the others also attacked simultaneously, charging at Su Yu!

"The Civilization River manifests civilization, myriad paths converge to break myriad paths!"

Boom!

The power of myriad paths converged, a long river encircling the four corners of heaven and earth. At this moment, from that Civilization River, countless Su Yus emerged, each holding a book, seemingly narrating the civilization of the myriad races, the civilization of myriad paths.

"I am the Demon, the Demon Path intimidates the myriad races, the Demon Fortune covers heaven and earth, summoning the Demon Ancestor!"

Boom!

In the endless void, a phantom seemed to appear, the Demon Race's racial ability, Demon Descent!

Summoning a powerful existence from the void!

In an instant, the Demon Path Su Yu became incomparably powerful, charging at the several great experts!

"I am the Immortal, seeking only longevity, not fame, immortality is the true Immortal..."

An Immortal Race Su Yu appeared, immortal aura ethereal, surrounded by the years, the years grow old, but I do not, immortality is the true Immortal!

"I am the God, sacred and inviolable, sitting high in the nine heavens, the God Ancestor suppresses the universe..."

One by one, Su Yus appeared, peerless experts emerged, seemingly summoning power from the void, immortality, inviolability, demonic flames burning the heavens!

In the distance, those myriad race experts were all stunned!

At this moment, they seemed to truly see the Demon Ancestor, the Immortal Ancestor, the God Ancestor... those who opened eras, who founded races!

Do they... truly exist?

At this moment, Su Yu, in his world, created one incomparably powerful existence after another.

Boom!

These incarnations of Su Yu narrated the civilization of myriad paths, elucidated the creation of heaven and earth, spread civilization, founded races, and opened eras!

Books covered the heavens.

The Demon Ancestor's flames burned the sky, instantly enveloping Lei Bao, Yue Luo, and Yue Xiao in his books, the God Ancestor targeted Hundred Battle, pulling him into his book of the God Path.

The Immortal Ancestor targeted Yu, instantly enveloping him in his book.

However, Yu was indeed powerful. Just as he was pulled in, a long spear directly shattered the book, and the Immortal Ancestor was killed on the spot, but soon, the Immortal Ancestor resurrected, "I am the Immortal, immortality is the true Immortal!"

That Immortal Race incarnation, destroyed in an instant, actually revived again!

However, in the void, Su Yu's face turned slightly pale, but soon, he snorted coldly, once again controlling the world!

One by one, incarnations appeared again!

At this moment, there were Nether, Dragon, Phoenix, Spirit, Soul...

These incarnations charged at the few people!

All holding books, elucidating the roots of the great Dao, the beginning of civilization!

Hundred Battle was insanely furious, his fists suppressing the world, shattering the God Ancestor in the book repeatedly, yet the God Ancestor was incomparably sacred, radiating light, and after several attacks, Hundred Battle himself was affected, his gaze slightly dazed!

...

At this moment, on the myriad races' side, Yu Qing and the others' expressions changed.

Su Yu... was too terrifying!

No, the opener of the heavens was too terrifying!

And Yu Qing, at this moment, her expression also changed, glancing back at the Gate of Hell, too many had died, and at this moment, there was some movement at the Gate of Hell. She transmitted, "Everyone, at this moment, on Su Yu's side, only he and the Undead Emperor have combat power. He is dealing with those people... If we join forces, we can definitely kill Su Yu! Su Yu will surely die!"

This time, the opportunity was too good!

So good that as long as these people took action, Su Yu would surely die!

Five rulers of laws from the myriad races, on her side, she and Mo Heavenly Venerable were both close, Yue Zhan was also close, so many experts, enough to join forces to blow up Su Yu!

Barely counted as eight rulers of laws!

Even if they all entered Su Yu's world, they could blow up Su Yu's world. One against more than ten, no matter how strong Su Yu was, unless he was at the level of the Human Emperor, otherwise, even if he was as strong as the Martial King, he couldn't possibly win against more than ten rulers of laws!

At this moment, on the myriad races' side, they all looked at Tiangu.

At this moment, indeed, the opportunity was too rare!

And Tiangu, his expression changed, speaking in a low voice, "Our people are all in his world, both in the Upper Realm and the Lower Realm... With his ruthlessness, even if he loses, your and my races will be exterminated! Even if we win, we will only have so many people left!"

They might win!

But Su Yu's ruthlessness was unimaginable, even if he lost, he would kill everyone, that was beyond doubt!

Tiangu transmitted to everyone, speaking in a deep voice, "Do we gamble for a chance, for Su Yu to release our people, let us take them away... or... gamble that Su Yu can't kill our people, and we kill him first!"

A few people's expressions changed slightly!

Do they gamble?

"Even if we kill Su Yu... if the Sin Race and Hundred Battle join forces, will they really not deal with us? They... might not even be as trustworthy as Su Yu!"

Tiangu finally transmitted his voice, "Kill Yu Qing and Yue Zhan. If we delay any longer... once Su Yu wins, we might face even greater trouble! Su Yu is currently unsealing, allowing us to advance... I suspect... he might choose to expel us, entering the Gate of Hell or the Heaven Gate... sealing the Gate of Hell, denying us the chance to cause trouble!"

Tiangu quickly added, "We, the five rulers of laws, might have a chance if we go in... but outside, we might not even have a single opportunity!"

The Divine Empress glanced over at Su Yu's side and transmitted her voice, "Tiangu... do you think he will expel us behind the Gate of Hell?"

"If he doesn't kill us, that's the best choice! At this moment, it seems only the Gate of Hell is fully located, allowing entry and exit! If Yu Qing and the others can enter, then so can we!"

The Divine Empress and the others quickly pondered. If this were true, what would be their fate after going behind the Gate of Hell?

Tiangu swiftly said, "There is certainly danger, possibly encountering powerful beings like the Control King! But the danger... might not be greater than it is now. With good luck, we might find a place to rest, waiting for the return of the Immortal Emperor and others... we might even be able to rally a group of Chaos Ancient Beast experts behind the Gate of Hell and return once more!"

Tiangu transmitted, "While we have the chance, eliminate Yu Qing and the others, demand our clansmen from Su Yu, and enter voluntarily... don't give him the chance to expel us! This way, we might avoid being manipulated by Su Yu!"

The rulers of laws hesitated for a moment, and Tiangu said heavily, "Have you forgotten... the South Heavenly King and the others have merged with the Dao, but they are not wasted, just weakened a bit, and they haven't moved! They are guarding against us!"

Have you forgotten about them just because you see Su Yu fighting alone?

They are slightly weaker than before, but with so many experts, even if they are weaker, along with the non-weakened Nether Heavenly Venerable, can a few rulers of laws really destroy Su Yu and his people?

Moreover, that Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger are lurking around; have you ignored them too?

Su Yu is guarding against them!

When it comes to the critical moment, these people can still fight. The final result might be the complete annihilation of Su Yu's people, but they... might also suffer heavy casualties, for this is Su Yu's world!

Everyone suddenly realized, the people were right under their noses, and they almost ignored them. This was a terrifying thing!

Su Yu seemed to be deliberately creating the impression that the South Heavenly King and others were powerless!

But is that really the case?

The next moment, the Divine Empress's expression changed, and she suddenly transmitted, "Kill!"

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed, as the Dragon and Phoenix experts instantly entangled Yu Qing. The Desolate Heavenly Venerable and Saint Marquis joined forces to attack Mo Heavenly Venerable, while the Divine Empress, with her long sword, unleashed the power of laws to the extreme once again, slashing towards Yue Zhan!

Yue Zhan's expression changed, and Yu Qing roared in anger, "How foolish!"

Too foolish!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded across the Myriad Realms. Yue Zhan roared furiously, and the shadow of the Gate of Hell appeared, only to be instantly shattered, a blood mark appearing on his forehead.

With a hint of unwillingness and despair, Yue Zhan suddenly turned to Yu Qing, his mouth opening slightly... Perhaps, if you had given me the chaotic will, and I had devoured it and advanced, the result wouldn't be like this!

Yu Qing... you all... have changed!

You have also abandoned your clansmen, more willing to use our lives to open the Gate of Hell!

He suddenly smiled, and the next moment, turned to look at Yue Luo and the others, large drops of blood falling from his mouth, roaring, "Yue Luo, Yue Xiao... remember, a race that sacrifices its own people to fulfill others... does not deserve to exist! Survive!"

Boom!

A loud explosion, Yue Zhan exploded, and in his dying moment, he saw through everything.

The so-called Holy Race was a joke!

Yu Qing and the others had long changed!

Welcoming the Control King, welcoming the Human Ancestor, that was the core, as for others dying, no one would care!

Such a race... does not deserve to exist!

We are actually not even as good as the myriad races, the myriad races are still fighting for their race, and we, who are we fighting for?

Pathetic!
