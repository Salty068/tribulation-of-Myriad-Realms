Chapter 795: The Grand Show Begins! (10,000-word update, please subscribe)

This time, the myriad races moved swiftly.

The power of 20 pseudo-daos wasn't much to speak of. Over the years, guarding the Source of the Dao, various races had acquired plenty of these unclaimed powers of the Great Dao. The key issue was that many people didn't want to switch paths. Some of these daos appeared weak and insignificant, making it pointless to exchange for them.

Could Su Yu create 20 Daofuse experts with these? It was unlikely! Even if he could, they would be weak Daofuse experts, unlikely to rival top-tier Eternals. The myriad races weren't truly afraid of Su Yu gaining a few more weak Daofuse experts.

Thus, this transaction proceeded smoothly.

...

The other party arrived at night, and by midnight, someone had come knocking.

They delivered the Daofuse power!

The one bringing the items this time wasn't just anyone—it was Thunderstorm. The myriad races were indeed worried. Worried about what? Worried that if someone else came, Su Yu might turn them against their own, or something else might happen.

Thunderstorm... if you want to turn him, go ahead.

Now, Thunderstorm was an open card! Everyone knew this guy was with Hundred Battle, but they didn't say it. It was meaningless! They just treated him as a hired thug!

...

Bamboo Mountain.

Thunderstorm's expression was slightly complex. The domineering Su Yu not only gave the myriad races a show of force but also took away the Iron Devourer Race. And now, the myriad races were even sending him treasures to make him act. Although not particularly precious, 20 strands of Daofuse power were not insignificant. To the Heavenly Sovereigns, they might seem trivial, but if given to a small race, they could produce 20 Daofuse experts. Even if weak, they would still be Daofuse experts, instantly elevating a small race to a major one!

"Emperor Yu, the Myriad Race Council hopes you can act as soon as possible..."

Thunderstorm conveyed the myriad races' request.

The sooner, the better! This time, the myriad races weren't dragging their feet.

Su Yu smiled.

"Alright!"

Su Yu nodded. "Tomorrow morning then. I don't like night raids, but... I have a request!"

"Please, Emperor Yu!"

Thunderstorm was quite courteous.

But Su Yu was not polite, speaking indifferently, "I want all the Heavenly Sovereigns of the myriad races to see me off tomorrow morning!"

"Hmm?"

Thunderstorm was taken aback. What kind of request was this?

Su Yu continued coldly, "The Emperor is going to war, and these guys won't see me off? In ancient times, this would be akin to the emperor personally leading an expedition! I want the strong from all races to come and line up to see me off. What I want is face!"

"......"

Thunderstorm was genuinely stunned. Damn you! This request was truly unexpected.

He wanted the myriad races to see him off!

Damn!

What kind of request was this?

"Emperor Yu, this..."

Su Yu coldly replied, "A small request, and the myriad races can't fulfill it? You want me to be the vanguard? Do you really think I have to cooperate with the myriad races? Tell them, not only do they have to see me off, but Tiangu, Jiwu, and Demon Halberd, the leaders of the three races in the lower realm, must wear ancient general uniforms tomorrow. Yes, and everyone else must change into ancient attire! Those who are marquises must wear marquis robes, and those who are nobodies must wear ancient military uniforms..."

"......"

Thunderstorm was dumbfounded!

This... he frowned and said, "Emperor Yu, this might be difficult!"

Su Yu coldly replied, "Difficult? Not at all! The three great races aren't the kind to care about face, are they? They aren't, but I am!"

Su Yu arrogantly declared, "Tomorrow, I'll wear the ancient emperor's robe! Before going to war, I want to experience what it's like to be an ancient Human Emperor! Tiangu and the others... let them wear the emperor's robes of the ancient races!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Yes, just like that! Not just them, but all the leaders of the races must do the same! I want to experience the ceremony of the myriad emperors paying homage!"

This time, Thunderstorm truly couldn't handle it!

This... this was even more unacceptable than having a few Heavenly Sovereigns see Su Yu off.

My heavens!

This madman Su Yu actually wanted the myriad races to restore the ancient rituals, to see him off, and to use the ancient emperor's ceremony to send him off to war.

For a moment, Thunderstorm was conflicted. This... I can't even bring this up when I go back.

Su Yu, however, said coldly, "Don't resist! Go back and explain it well! Also... one more thing, do you have any contact with Moon Luo?"

Thunderstorm was startled and quickly laughed, "Emperor Yu, you misunderstand. How could I have any contact with Moon Luo?"

Su Yu calmly said, "Good! I'm giving you a chance. Tomorrow, if I kill Moon Luo, when you meet Hundred Battle, don't forget to tell him it wasn't my intention to kill her, but because Moon Luo didn't know her place!"

"If you can contact Moon Luo, tell her that if I go to war tomorrow, she'd better find an excuse not to show up in front of me... Otherwise, I despise coquettish women like her and won't hesitate to kill her at all costs!"

Thunderstorm laughed awkwardly, "Of course, of course... but I really don't speak with Moon Luo, Emperor Yu, don't misunderstand!"

Su Yu sneered, "Honestly, the woman from your race who married into Hundred Battle, who is she to you? Are you deliberately trying to get me to kill Moon Luo? To eliminate a rival for your daughter or sister?"

"Emperor Yu, you really misunderstand..."

Suddenly, Su Yu stopped being serious and, with a gossipy tone, said, "There's no one else here, who are we kidding? Come on, Thunderstorm, tell me, who is she to you? Also, who is the child born to Hundred Battle? After all, he's a direct descendant of the Human Ancestor, how come there's no news? Hundred Battle hides it so well, I don't believe he's a waste with no abilities."

Su Yu smiled slyly, "Could it be... he's become a master of the rules? Stronger than Hundred Battle? Hundred Battle hasn't been around for years, yet those ancient experts aren't anxious at all, not a peep from them. They can really endure!"

"One can endure, but I don't believe a group of warriors can endure for 6,000 years without a sound!"

"Also, it's impossible to seal all those ancient experts. That's not normal; they would have rebelled long ago. If that's the case, there must be some people who can restrain them from rebelling!"

"Not only not rebelling, but also giving them hope!"

Su Yu smiled slyly, "I think this Hundred Battle's crown prince isn't weak!"

Su Yu stroked his chin, "Honestly, I didn't pay much attention before, but recently, I've started to care."

Thunderstorm remained silent, extremely quiet, but inside, he was feeling waves of emotion.

Su Yu chuckled, "Don't stay silent! Nine is the extreme, Hundred Battle's intelligence, talent, and martial prowess are all extremely strong! But they don't match his strength!"

"What?"

Thunderstorm was surprised, "Emperor Yu... thinks Hundred Battle King... isn't strong enough?"

Su Yu laughed, "How many people gave way to Hundred Battle back then?"

Thunderstorm said nothing.

Su Yu laughed, "Alright, I won't talk about that. Let's talk about something else. How many strong people in the Human Race are still walking the path of the physical body?"

Su Yu looked at Giant Axe, "Are you?"

Giant Axe shook his head.

"Is Dingjun?"

Giant Axe continued to shake his head.

"Is the Human Race's physical body path strong?"

Giant Axe nodded!

Su Yu stroked his chin, deep in thought, "So many people gave way, Daofuse, Heavenly Kings, Heavenly Sovereigns... those who didn't give way were killed! Anyway, are there any strong people alive who walk the path of the physical body?"

Giant Axe shook his head again.

Su Yu looked at Thunderstorm and suddenly said, "Strange... the Giant Race walks the path of the physical body, right?"

Thunderstorm was momentarily silent.

Su Yu frowned, "The Giant Race also walks the path of the physical body, the Giant's physical body path? But the Giant Race, ancient overlords, didn't seem to produce many strong people, certainly not as many as the Immortal, Demon, and God races!"

Su Yu continued, "The physical body path... merging paths!"

"If one person walks some of the Human Race's physical body path and some of the Giant Race's physical body path, is that possible?"

Giant Axe shook his head.

Su Yu sighed, "You guys... if the Great Zhou King were here, he'd talk to me. You guys just nod and shake your heads, nothing else!"

Su Yu laughed, then quickly said, "I said Hundred Battle isn't strong, but that's based on a premise. The physical body path isn't restricted by the master of rules, so many strong people gave way to Hundred Battle, how come he's only this strong?"

"He doesn't dare to fight the Control King's lineage, doesn't dare to fight the myriad races, which means even if he's strong, he's only so strong, at most just reaching the level of a master of rules!"

"Honestly, the first person in 90,000 years!"

"The first person not restricted!"

"Just like some ancient physical body Human Kings, isn't that a waste of his title? The physical body path isn't like other paths that can't become masters of rules, and so many people gave way to him, and he's still a descendant of the Human Ancestor... he's a descendant of the Battle King, right? The Battle King should also be a descendant of the Human Ancestor, right?"

"Since it wasn't mentioned before, what does that mean? It means Hundred Battle is more like the Human Ancestor, not the Battle King!"

Su Yu kept talking, raising his eyebrows, "But he's only barely reached the level of a master of rules... it's disappointing, something's not right, this isn't right!"

Su Yu was just gossiping, but suddenly felt something was off.

At this moment, Thunderstorm smiled, "Emperor Yu, are you overthinking?"

"Shut up!"

Su Yu scolded, displeased, "Don't interrupt me. I like to make reasonable deductions based on existing clues, don't disrupt my train of thought!"

"Scholars, you know, take one step, think one step ahead, it's a good thing!"

Su Yu smiled, "Also, since Hundred Battle is a descendant of the Human Ancestor... it's said the Giant Race is too, so why not walk the Giant Race's Great Dao? Can the physical body path be merged, does Hundred Battle know?"

"Also, is the Giant Race's physical body path and the Human Race's physical body path both opened by the Human Ancestor?"

"Did the Human Ancestor actually open two physical body paths?"

Su Yu murmured, "Then how did Hundred Battle gain your recognition, he said he's a descendant of the Human Ancestor, and you believed him? Are the Giant Race so stupid? If I said I was, would you believe me?"

Thunderstorm laughed dryly, "It's all rumors, we actually have nothing to do with Hundred Battle..."

Su Yu coldly said, "Shut up, say one more word, and I'll let you leave lying down!"

March and the others quickly surrounded him.

Thunderstorm's face completely changed!

Su Yu continued, "So, there must be something that maintains your relationship... like Hundred Battle's son! A figure who walks the path of the Giant Race's physical dao, and perhaps even the Human Race's physical dao!"

"Everyone made way, but Hundred Battle didn't seize it... I think Hundred Battle is ambitious, but asking others to make way and then taking it himself doesn't fit his character... unless it's for his descendants! Like his son!"

"His son was too young to compete with everyone, so the areas everyone vacated were given to his son!"

"And maybe his son is a genius, a super genius! He possesses the talents of Hundred Battle and the Giant Race. On one hand, he can walk the Human Race's physical dao, and on the other, the Giant Race's physical dao!"

"Perhaps his son even has the ambition to merge the two paths!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "Wow, that would be incredible! The Giant Race isn't a weak race! And for so many years, apart from you, Thunderstorm, no other Heavenly Sovereign has emerged..."

March raised a paw!

Su Yu was puzzled, "What's wrong?"

March, this big guy, raised his paw like a primary school student, looking pitiful.

March whispered, "Your Majesty, only I have reached the Heavenly Sovereign level in my race. Isn't it normal not to reach Heavenly Sovereign?"

"Nonsense!"

Su Yu retorted, "How can it be the same? Is the Iron Devourer Race an ancient overlord?"

"No."

"An ancient overlord?"

"...No..."

"Then how can it be the same?"

Su Yu laughed, "Overlord races are different! A starved camel is still bigger than a horse! The Ancient Giant Race wouldn't be much weaker than the Immortals, Demons, or Gods. Thunderstorm's strength is average, and the number of Daofuse experts in the race is also average! The physical dao, theoretically..."

Su Yu paused, "Wait, Thunderstorm, are you walking the physical dao?"

Thunderstorm was silent.

Su Yu frowned, "Thunderstorm, are you not walking the physical dao? The physical dao... isn't it unrestricted?"

Thunderstorm replied solemnly, "There are restrictions. Our race's physical dao isn't the same as the Human Race's physical dao. The Human Race's physical dao is powerful and seems unrestricted, but our race's physical dao is weak, far inferior to the Human Race's physical dao..."

"Is that so?"

Su Yu looked at him suspiciously, "You wouldn't have made way for Hundred Battle's son, would you?"

"Emperor Yu, you're overthinking!"

Thunderstorm said in a deep voice, "These are all baseless rumors!"

Su Yu pondered, "Suppose Hundred Battle has a powerful son, suppose... I'll give him a name, Bai Da! Hundred Battle, Bai Da, sounds good!"

March whispered, "Hundred Battle's surname isn't Bai!"

"Mm!"

Su Yu nodded, "I know, the Human Ancestor's surname is Zhou, right?"

"All the same!"

Su Yu laughed, "Let's say this little Bai Da, if he was a prodigy from a young age, even showing signs of atavism, reverting to the era of the Human Ancestor... maybe... I can understand why Hundred Battle has been waiting for 6,000 years, sparing no effort!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "Is he waiting? Waiting for his son?"

Su Yu's eyes kept changing, "Actually, Hundred Battle wasted 6,000 years! I'm thinking, would a top existence really spend 6,000 years waiting for a few Heavenly Sovereigns to appear under his command? Can a few Heavenly Sovereigns change the situation? But if he's waiting for his young son, 6,000 years can change a lot!"

Su Yu marveled, "Could it be... stronger than the average ruler of laws? If so, Hundred Battle's wait is actually worth it! This is a trump card! A power so strong that it might... rival the Martial Emperor?"

"If the Human Emperor doesn't return, that's an invincible existence!"

"Even if the current rulers of laws appear, they might not be able to match little Bai Da, right?"

Su Yu said, frowning slightly, "But... logically, no matter how talented, he should fight, so who is this Bai Da fighting? Could it be... I wonder, could it be that Hundred Battle's subordinates are actually hiding in the Giant Race, not idle, but accompanying Bai Da in battle? Using dozens of Daofuse experts to fight him, honing his combat will?"

"If so... then he should really fight a few times with real weapons! Hundred Battle isn't a fool; he should understand that flowers in a greenhouse are useless!"

"So who is this Bai Da fighting?"

Su Yu kept rubbing his chin, "That would require a place unknown to anyone, with many strong individuals, chaos?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "Could it be? Did he enter chaos to fight? There are many ancient beasts in chaos, quite a few strong ones, and beings like the Chaos Dragon should exist. If that's the case... if he fights deep in chaos, and he's on the physical dao, the physical dao isn't too suppressed by chaos!"

"Because the physical body is strong!"

Su Yu said, raising an eyebrow, "Do you know the Eight-Winged Tiger? Have you seen it? The Chaos Dragon has been in seclusion for many years, but the Eight-Winged Tiger seems to have been active in chaos!"

"If so... it means Hundred Battle knows that chaos can lead to the Upper Realm!"

Su Yu added, "Also, the first time I unsealed Hundred Battle, he and Moon Luo fought to the end of chaos and then disappeared... Damn, could they have gone to see his son?"

Su Yu marveled, "No way!"

"......"

A group of people listened silently to his words.

Su Yu spoke as if it were true!

The key is... listening to it, why does it feel like it's true?

It seems like there really is such a Bai Da!

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly looked at Thunderstorm, his eyes strange, "Is this Bai Da still in chaos?"

"Huh?"

Thunderstorm seemed bewildered.

Su Yu's eyes changed, "Is he there?"

"What?"

Su Yu sneered, "I said Bai Da!"

"Emperor Yu really misunderstood!"

Thunderstorm said helplessly, "I admit, Hundred Battle King has a descendant in my race, but his strength is weak, just an Eternal in the lower realm Giant Race..."

"What's his name?"

"I don't know..."

Su Yu coldly said, "Nonsense, I remember the Great Zhou King telling me that Hundred Battle King and the daughter of the Ancient Giant King have a descendant, who is the current prince of the Ancient Giant Race, and you know nothing!"

"And the prince of the Ancient Giant Race... seems to have no reputation, not even as good as your race's Gushan, a Sunmoon Realm expert!"

"Moreover, your Ancient Giant Race, would you dare to choose anyone as a prince? You're a clan leader, and you know nothing? Even if you didn't know before, this time you descended to the lower realm, you didn't return to the Ancient Giant Race, and when you did, you still didn't know the name of Hundred Battle's descendant?"

Su Yu said coldly, "Is that possible? Thunderstorm, you're pretending to be ignorant, and it's a bit too much!"

Sweat appeared faintly on Thunderstorm's forehead, quickly disappearing without a trace.

Su Yu frowned, "Could it be that I guessed right, and he's really a dual physical dao expert? Damn! If so, that might be a bit terrifying. Could this be Hundred Battle's trump card?"

"I was wondering before, even if Hundred Battle defeats the myriad races, defeats the Control King's lineage, how would he deal with other crises? Like the Martial Emperor, does Hundred Battle really not know about the Martial Emperor's existence? Like the Undead Emperor, does he not know about the Undead Emperor's existence? Like the rulers of laws in the Control King's lineage... Moon Luo is his person, would he not know about these people's existence?"

Su Yu sat down, tapping the table, with some doubts, "If this Bai Da really exists, and he's in chaos... then Hundred Battle can actually ascend to the Upper Realm, he knows chaos can lead to the Upper Realm!"

Thunderstorm remained silent.

Su Yu suddenly shouted coldly, "Chaos can lead to the Upper Realm, and you're not curious at all?"

"......"

Thunderstorm quickly said, "Emperor Yu, I... I dare not ask too much."

Su Yu sneered, "You're the strongest of the Giant Race, and you don't dare to ask a single question? You're too cowardly, aren't you? Fine, I'll tell the myriad races, tell the Control King's lineage, tell them how strong Hundred Battle is, how strong his subordinates are, how powerful his son is..."

Thunderstorm said in a deep voice, "The myriad races... they won't believe it."

Su Yu sneered, "Idiot! Then I'll open the lower realm again, and I'll take the myriad races to fight Hundred Battle first!"

"......"

Thunderstorm was stunned!

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Yes, fight Hundred Battle first! Just say it's to prevent future troubles, I'm worried Hundred Battle will backstab us, so we'll take out Hundred Battle first, and after that, we'll fight the Control King's lineage. Do you think the myriad races would be willing?"

Thunderstorm said in a deep voice, "The myriad races would worry if Emperor Yu is plotting against them!"

Su Yu grinned, "Plot or not, I'm going to fight Hundred Battle, will they fight or not?"

"......"

Thunderstorm remained silent.

And Su Yu, observing his reaction, frowned slightly, "Damn it, there really is one! Judging by your expression, you're not too scared, but rather worried... fear and worry are different!"

Thunderstorm continued to remain silent, I have no expression, how did you see through it?

Marquis Tongtian seemed to know what he was thinking and laughed, "Explaining is covering up, silence is acquiescence! Silence is also a guilty conscience! Thunderstorm Heavenly Sovereign, it seems His Majesty guessed right!"

Marquis Tongtian looked admiringly, "His Majesty is amazing! It seems there really is such a little Bai Da!"

Su Yu murmured, "We know Hundred Battle has descendants, but no one paid attention!"

Saying this, Su Yu frowned, "Of course, it's just my speculation, whether it exists or not, it's hard to say now, maybe Hundred Battle is really quite useless, so many people made way, and he hibernated for 6,000 years, and this is all he has!"

Is Hundred Battle really useless?

Giant Axe and the others thought for a moment, and couldn't say for sure.

Su Yu took a deep breath, "I'm just gossiping, did I overthink it?"

I'm just curious, what's Hundred Battle's son's name, who is his woman, what does he look like, and then I gossiped for a while, suddenly thinking of many things.

The key is, Su Yu looked at Thunderstorm, meaningfully, "I thought so much, Thunderstorm Sovereign deserves credit, I ask you, at this point, just say it, satisfy my curiosity, why are you still hiding it?"

Su Yu squinted and said, "You act like you don't know about this! I know, yet you even hide a name! Thunderstorm, are you feeling guilty?"

Thunderstorm opened his mouth, hurriedly saying, "Emperor Yu, you've misunderstood. I just... I'm just worried that the Myriad Races will target me!"

Su Yu laughed, "Why would they? The Myriad Races already target you. Saying a name would make it worse?"

He chuckled, "So, what's the name of Hundred Battle's son?"

Thunderstorm laughed awkwardly, "Well... it's nothing special, just an ordinary Eternal named Zhou Ji."

"Zhou Ji? What Ji?"

"Uh... Ji as in the Ji of 'Sheji'!"

Su Yu's eyes shifted slightly, "That's a good name! Sheji, in ancient times, even the Son of Heaven had to worship Sheji. Ji, the god of grains! People live by food, and everyone needs to eat, even us. Even though we practice fasting, we still need to absorb source qi, which is essentially eating. That's Ji!"

Zhou Ji! The god worshipped by the Myriad Races!

"Zhou Tian Sheji, Zhou, that surname isn't simple. Paired with Ji, it's clear they have ambitions!"

Su Yu murmured, "My name is Yu, which isn't common either, but it's quite ordinary. Ji, on the other hand, isn't common!"

"What is his strength?"

"Eternal!"

Su Yu's eyes turned cold, "Are you stupid, or do you think I am? Hundred Battle's son, six or seven thousand years old, and you tell me he's just an Eternal? Is Hundred Battle a failure, or did that woman from your race put a hat on him?"

Su Yu sneered, "Hundred Battle, someone who was close to becoming a master of laws six thousand years ago, and his son is just an Eternal? So, is this Zhou Ji not his son? Or is he yours? If your son is such a failure, I might believe it!"

Thunderstorm was extremely embarrassed! What kind of talk was this!

Su Yu sneered, "A potential throwback, and you all make him out to be a complete failure! I've realized, does the Hundred Battle lineage enjoy self-deprecation? Hundred Battle was called a failure, a brute, impulsive, easily angered... but is that true? Now his son is also called a failure. Do you believe that Hundred Battle's son, after six thousand years, is still just an Eternal?"

Thunderstorm remained silent.

Su Yu frowned, "What is his real strength?"

Thunderstorm stayed silent for a while. Suddenly, Su Yu stopped paying attention to him, and in an instant, he began calculating with his fingers. In a flash, a divine character appeared, and then, with a boom, it shattered!

Su Yu murmured, "So that's it. Damn, even his name is hidden to avoid being calculated! And you actually revealed his real name!"

Thunderstorm was even more shocked, "Emperor Yu... you know divination?"

How could it be! You're so young, how do you know everything!

At this moment, a bit of blood oozed from Su Yu's finger. His expression changed, "Thunderstorm, you guys really know how to play! Impressive! Layer upon layer, huh? Alright, even if Hundred Battle is exposed, there's still a son... impressive!"

"Your schemes are really one after another! Moon Luo, Hundred Battle, Giant Race, Human Ancestor, Zhou Ji... tsk tsk, you're really top-notch at scheming, but... isn't it too troublesome?"

Su Yu grinned, "If you have the strength, why not try being a bit more forceful?"

Thunderstorm's expression changed unpredictably. After a long time, he spoke, "Emperor Yu, you've really misunderstood. I should return now. You won't stop me from going back, will you?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "I will!"

"......"

Thunderstorm was stunned!

Two armies at war do not kill envoys! Moreover, we are cooperating!

Su Yu squinted, "Forget it, I won't make it difficult for you. Just one request! Promise me, and I won't make it difficult for you!"

"Please speak, Emperor Yu!"

Thunderstorm was almost sweating!

Su Yu smiled, "Simple. Tomorrow, during the send-off, act as my man and lure Dragon Heavenly Venerable aside, away from the other Heavenly Venerables. At the critical moment, we'll make a move on Dragon Heavenly Venerable, and you hold him down for me!"

"......"

Thunderstorm's mouth gaped open, "Emperor Yu wants to make a move on the Myriad Races?"

What the hell! Are you crazy?

Su Yu shook his head, "No such thing. I just don't like him. When I first arrived, he dared to make a move on me. Before I leave tomorrow, I want to beat him up!"

Do you think I believe that?

But... aside from beating him up, could Su Yu really kill him in front of everyone?

Thunderstorm was momentarily confused!

Su Yu chuckled, "Will you do it or not? If not, I'll spill everything! If you do it, I'll take the blame for you. Just pretend to be my man. I'm not afraid!"

"......"

At this moment, Thunderstorm's face changed unpredictably. Su Yu laughed, "Alright, I'll take it as you agreeing! If you do it tomorrow, I'll say you're my messenger. Otherwise, I'll spill everything about Little Hundred Battle and Hundred Battle. Do you think the Myriad Races will believe it? Even if they don't, will they take it seriously? Will the Control King's lineage believe it? The affair between Moon Luo and Hundred Battle, even if no one believes it, do you think the Control King's lineage won't investigate? Is there no trace at all?"

Thunderstorm was silent for a while, then said in a deep voice, "Emperor Yu... think twice before acting! We are all of the Human Race..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu said coldly, "Those I recognize are the Human Race! Those I don't are enemies! Giants aren't human, understand? If you really want to talk about the Human Race, maybe the Immortals, Demons, and Gods are all Human Race! Among the Myriad Races, humanoid creatures might have all been Human Race at the start! Since they've separated, they're not the same race anymore, understand?"

Thunderstorm fell silent again. After a long time, he nodded, "I understand. I will convey Emperor Yu's words to the Myriad Races!"

"That's for the best!"

Su Yu chuckled, "I just divined Little Hundred Battle. Did he notice? If he did, it's good. Scare Little Hundred Battle a bit. My big nephew is quite strong, but I'm of the same generation as his father, so he can call me uncle! Maybe he's even of your grandson's generation, and since we're of the same generation, he can call me grandpa, right?"

Thunderstorm said nothing and turned to leave.

March said in a low voice, "Your Majesty!"

Thunderstorm paused in his steps. Su Yu laughed, "What? Do you really want to keep him? Forget it, I'm just guessing wildly. Let him go! Thunderstorm, remember, if you don't do a good job tomorrow, I'll lose my temper!"

Thunderstorm quickly left!

Watching him leave, Giant Axe finally said in a daze, "Your Majesty... you... were just telling a story, right?"

It felt like listening to a heavenly book!

Su Yu said calmly, "Not a story, an incident!"

At this moment, Xuelan, who hadn't spoken much, suddenly said, "Why are you so sure that Hundred Battle's son is a genius?"

It had been mentioned before that Hundred Battle had a son. But why was Su Yu so certain the other party was a genius?

Seeing Su Yu look over, she was silent for a while before saying coldly, "My mother is also a Human King, and over the years, I've only reached the Heavenly King realm! My mother is also strong, probably stronger than Hundred Battle... why can't his son be an Eternal?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "You might just be a bit useless!"

"......"

Silence!

Su Yu, however, seriously said, "First, your mother can't compare to Hundred Battle! Hundred Battle is the number one person in the past hundred thousand years! At least, in these hundred thousand years, apart from our generation, he is the most outstanding!"

"If it weren't for the current era being inferior to ancient times, Hundred Battle's achievements wouldn't be inferior to the Martial King! Remember, actually now, due to the lack of competition from peers, many people are achieving less than in ancient times!"

"Second, Hundred Battle was accepted by the Giant Race, but Dou Wang wasn't. This shows that, in the eyes of the Giant Race, Hundred Battle is more excellent and has a purer bloodline than Dou Wang!"

"Third, Hundred Battle's son is a result of a strong union, one being Hundred Battle, and the other must be the most outstanding woman of the Giant Race! Your father... might not be strong!"

Xuelan's face stiffened.

Su Yu continued, "Fourth, I was just guessing, but Thunderstorm was evasive and seemed guilty, why?"

"Fifth, I divined, and the divine character shattered instantly, which is rare for me!"

"Sixth, Hundred Battle waited six thousand years, just to wait for a few Heavenly Venerables? Is it really necessary?"

Su Yu laughed, "How old was Hundred Battle when he was sealed last time?"

March knew and calculated, "Not even a thousand years old!"

"Yes, someone not even a thousand years old, waiting six thousand years for one chance, just to wait for a few Heavenly Venerables, is it worth it?"

Xuelan frowned, "But... maybe he reached a limit and couldn't improve anymore!"

Su Yu nodded, "That's possible!"

Xuelan breathed a sigh of relief, finally getting some recognition from Su Yu.

But Su Yu quickly laughed, "Then that means Hundred Battle is still a failure, and failures... don't deserve loyalty! Why do those ancient powerhouses stay loyal to him?"

"......"

Xuelan didn't know what to say.

Su Yu continued, "Do you know how many powerhouses he has under him? Is there no one rebellious?"

"There are!"

Su Yu laughed, "Then why do they stay with him, willing to lie low for six thousand years! Are all ancient powerhouses so stupid? And they'd rather give up the Human Emperor's inheritance to turn to the Human Ancestor? Why?"

"......"

Xuelan couldn't explain.

Su Yu sighed, "It's hard to say! Maybe his son has always been there, and he's even more outstanding!"

Saying this, Su Yu laughed, "Forget it, who doesn't have a backup plan these days?"

"Except for some idiots, everyone has a backup plan. Look, don't I have one?"

Saying this, Su Yu raised the bracelet on his hand and laughed, "Tell all my guesses to the Great Zhou King and the others! Also, ask the Eight-Winged Tiger if it has encountered a tough guy in the chaos!"

From the bracelet, Lantian's voice quickly came, "I'll convey it immediately. Your Majesty, will there be any problems?"

Su Yu laughed, "What are you afraid of! Even if Hundred Battle and his son join forces, they don't dare to show up, which means even if his son is strong, he's limited! Maybe slightly stronger than Hundred Battle, but probably not as strong as the Martial Emperor... aren't they just two masters of laws?"

He made it sound simple!

Lantian was also helpless, very powerful, okay!

Su Yu chuckled, "It's fine. There are still many formidable enemies out there. Hundred Battle won't show himself easily! Just some plans need a bit of tweaking. As expected, plans can't keep up with changes! If it really doesn't work... I might have to make a trip to the Death Realm and have a chat about life with the Martial Emperor! Initially, I wanted to kill him, but on second thought, forget it. The Martial Emperor is just a simple brute, truly a kind soul! Hundred Battle, on the other hand, is a fake brute, just like me, not a good person at all!"

"......"

Everyone looked at him. Was this... self-deprecation?

No, was it self-awareness?

Meanwhile, Su Yu laughed heartily, "It's getting more and more interesting, you know? This is just an appetizer. I think soon, the Human Ancestor, Human Emperor, Master of Time, Lord of the Dead, and Culture King will all make their appearances! This era is too thrilling! Hundred Battle and his son are just minor players; the big fish are yet to come. Maybe there's even a Lord of Chaos! Besides, there's the Gate of Hell, Heaven Gate, and perhaps even a Heaven-penetrating Gate, right?"

Su Yu glanced at Marquis Tongtian, who nodded vigorously, beaming with joy, "Your Majesty, as long as you help me grow stronger, I'll assist you in sealing all these people behind my gate! From then on, the entire world will belong to your era alone, and all these guys will be kicked in!"

"You ungrateful thing!"

Su Yu jokingly scolded, "The Culture King helped you too, yet you have no conscience. Maybe one day you'll seal me as well!"

"......"

Marquis Tongtian looked embarrassed, realizing his flattery had backfired!

Su Yu stood up, chuckled, and gazed into the distance towards Ren Mountain!

At this moment, Ren Mountain was likely not peaceful either!

"This era will only get more interesting and more dangerous... I wonder how long you foolish bunch can survive?"

Su Yu murmured softly.

The grand show had begun!
