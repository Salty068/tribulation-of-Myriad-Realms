Chapter 792: Calm Amidst the Madness

Bamboo Mountain.

At this moment, Bamboo Mountain was deserted. Some peaks had been excavated, and the dojo was sealed off. It felt somewhat desolate. Although the Iron Devourer Race had only left recently, the place already seemed barren, lacking any sign of life.

March opened the seal, and a group of people entered. To call it a group... well, there weren't many of them. Xuelan remained silent, Fat Ball looked around curiously, and only Marquis Tongtian was bustling about, busy with chores. At this point, he was the only one suitable for such tasks, being too weak. Even the weakest among them, Xuelan, was at the level of a Heavenly King. As a second-tier Daofuse cultivator, what else could he do but handle chores?

Quickly, he cleared a space for Su Yu and the others, setting up a bamboo house. Marquis Tongtian was busy but content. Coming to the Upper Realm was great! Here, they could kill Yue Hao, defeat the ancestors of the Control King lineage, and if they succeeded, Marquis Tongtian would prosper! Without coming to the Upper Realm, he could only hope to defeat the Martial Emperor. But having been neighbors with the Martial Emperor for so long, it was more satisfying to defeat the Control King lineage.

As he busied himself, March hesitated and asked, "Your Majesty, when should we take action? Should we wait for the myriad races to make the first move?"

"Of course not!" Su Yu replied with a smile. "Let's wait a few days, give the Control King lineage some time to summon their ruler of laws. Of course, if they seem indifferent, we need to apply some pressure!"

"The Eight-Winged Tiger misunderstood!" Su Yu chuckled. "If the Control King lineage isn't in danger, why would they hurry? But once they face a crisis, they'll rush, even at a cost, to summon their ruler of laws!"

March nodded and asked, "What about the Tea Plant and the others?"

"They're not in a hurry!" Su Yu laughed. "Right now, everyone has no real goals, so they have time for idle thoughts. Once the war breaks out, no one will have time for idle thoughts. That's when the Tea Plant and the others will make their move! Currently, Tiangu and those bastards are all guarding against me!"

If the Tea Plant suddenly appeared now, it might make those guys overthink. Su Yu wasn't in a hurry. He would wait. Once the war started and losses occurred, when both sides were engaged, there would be no time to consider whether the opportunity was a trap.

Su Yu had a knack for psychological warfare. Playing hard to get, creating false impressions, making opportunities seem hard to come by—these were good strategies. If opportunities came too easily, they wouldn't be cherished.

"So... Your Majesty, what should we do next?" Giant Axe was still confused. Should they wait or not? What exactly were they supposed to do?

Su Yu felt helpless. It was exhausting! This time, he hadn't brought any smart people, only those who could fight. None of them were thinkers. March wasn't stupid, but he tended to think from the perspective of the Iron Devourer Race, which didn't align with Su Yu's line of thinking. Asking March for advice wasn't reliable.

Forget it, he'd have to rely on himself. If only the Great Zhou King or Wan Tiansheng were here, it would be much easier. Unfortunately, strength and wisdom often don't go hand in hand.

Su Yu smiled and said, "Our fighting and killing are all for the purpose of strengthening ourselves, understand? That's the essence, the core!"

He continued meaningfully, "Fighting and killing aren't just for the thrill; they're to enhance us!"

"We've progressed too quickly. In the short term, it's hard to make further progress... So now, the best and simplest way to strengthen ourselves is for me to become stronger!"

Everyone nodded, including Fat Ball and Marquis Tongtian, who nodded enthusiastically.

"When I become stronger, those who have integrated into my dao will also become stronger!"

"And my strength depends on two things: first, the perfection of the Great Dao; second, the perfection of the world!"

Giant Axe was puzzled. "Aren't the Great Dao and the world the same?"

Su Yu sighed and explained, "They're not the same! The perfection of the Great Dao is about the Great Dao itself. Of course, perfecting the Great Dao helps strengthen the world, but the world can also strengthen itself!"

"How does it strengthen itself?" Giant Axe asked. Su Yu smiled, "That's a good question! There are several methods. First, devour the chaos origin, like the Eight-Winged Tiger and the others, to strengthen the world. Second, devour ancient beasts, as they are strong members of the Chaos Race, so killing them helps strengthen my world. Third, kill those who cultivate the chaos path. Fourth, kill myriad dao experts and strip them of their dao power to fill my own!"

Giant Axe summarized, "So, kill more people?"

"That's one way to put it," Su Yu nodded.

Giant Axe felt exhausted. Why couldn't he just say that directly? All this roundabout talk.

Su Yu was a bit helpless. "I'm explaining the purpose of killing, not just killing for the sake of it. It's different."

Giant Axe nodded perfunctorily. Still killing, isn't it?

Su Yu had no choice. Forget it, he wouldn't say more. Of course, it was different! Simply put, one kills without purpose, while the other kills with a goal. Without a goal, failure is certain. Only with a goal, faith, and a plan can one succeed!

Giant Axe didn't want to say more, and Fat Ball wasn't keen on thinking either. Curiously, it asked, "So, does that mean we can kill anyone, and killing them will make you stronger?"

"Not exactly!" Su Yu laughed. "Killing them isn't enough. You have to strip their dao power. If you kill them and their dao explodes, what do I gain? A corpse? It doesn't mean much! The key is to preserve as much of their dao origin power as possible after killing them!"

"How do we do that?" Fat Ball asked helplessly. "When we kill them, their dao explodes. How do we preserve a lot?"

"That's why it has to be quick and precise!" Su Yu smiled. "You have to be fast, so fast that they can't react, minimizing the consumption of their dao power, preserving the corpse intact, and allowing the dao to be stripped..."

Got it!

This time, Marquis Tongtian understood. "Your Majesty means to teach us how to kill? To kill with art and taste?"

Su Yu: "..."

How was he supposed to respond to that? That's what he meant, but not quite in the way Marquis Tongtian put it. Well, close enough.

Marquis Tongtian continued, "Your Majesty dislikes how Giant Axe and Fat Ball kill too crudely, leaving no corpses. It's not good, right? March too, smashing everything with one bamboo strike. Not ideal, right?"

Su Yu remained silent.

Marquis Tongtian went on, "I understand now. Your Majesty prefers Xuelan's method, freezing the enemy, right?"

His eyes lit up. "Is that what you mean, Your Majesty?"

Su Yu hesitated for a moment, then nodded after a pause. Damn it! You're mostly right, but it sounds different coming from you.

Now, Giant Axe understood too, feeling a bit helpless. "But we only know how to chop directly!"

Marquis Tongtian added, "For this kind of killing, Xuelan and Consort Qi are quite suitable. Women kill more elegantly, one freezes, the other petrifies. It's more artistic!"

Su Yu didn't bother to say more, quickly stating, "It's not about how many you kill, but about killing them completely. That's correct!"

"So, no matter how many we kill next, we must gain something from it. We can't kill for nothing!"

Su Yu continued, "We need to put pressure on the myriad races and the Control King lineage! Without pressure, they won't know we're serious. We must force them to bring the Iron Devourer Race here!"

"So now we..." Giant Axe looked at Su Yu. Su Yu smiled, "First, turn Bamboo Mountain into our rear base, then move the entire Bamboo Mountain to the front lines. Once it's there, we'll start our revenge! The slogan is to avenge the last incident! If the Control King lineage sends few people, we'll devour them. If they send many, we'll retreat to Ren Mountain!"

The group exchanged glances. So aggressive? Starting with a fight?

"What if the Chaos Ancient Race intervenes?"

"Kill them all the same!" Su Yu wasn't concerned. "Among the ancient beasts, only a few are intelligent. Most are not, so we don't need to worry! The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon will restrain them. Their purpose in gathering ancient beasts is to use them as cannon fodder to besiege the ruler of laws!"

After speaking, Su Yu quickly added with a smile, "So, our persona is simple: reckless!"

Personas are crafted by oneself. Let the myriad races guess! Guess all you want, but I have one word for you—reckless! It was the same last time, and it will be the same this time.

"So now, let's move! Establish a base, bring the Iron Devourer Race here, and when Marquis Giant Bamboo returns, they can train with the Iron Devourer Race..."

Alright! The group understood. The first day here was for moving. So, let's move!

Soon, the strong ones began moving, not just ordinary moving, but relocating the entire Bamboo Mountain dojo to the front lines, to stand alongside Ren Mountain. Su Yu wanted to establish a foothold there.

...

That day, at Ren Mountain, several top experts were seen carrying an enormous Bamboo Mountain, flying towards the front lines. The various races hadn't even digested some of the news yet. Su Yu had already moved Bamboo Mountain over.

Not only that, but on this day, Su Yu directly entered the outskirts of Chaos Mountain, relocating one chaotic divine mountain after another towards Bamboo Mountain. He intended to build a base there. In fact, it was to let everyone know where to find him.

...

At the peak of Ren Mountain.

At this moment, a group of experts looked across the distance at Bamboo Mountain, less than a hundred miles away. Su Yu was truly preparing to go to war with the Control King lineage.

At this time, someone spoke, "When do you think he'll come to discuss cooperation with us? If he does, what terms might he offer, or how can we use him?"

"It's hard to say. Maybe in three to five days, he'll come!" Several Heavenly Sovereigns discussed.

As they spoke, over there, Su Yu and his group, their auras surging, flew directly into Chaos Mountain, crossing the Chaos River.

Su Yu's voice thundered across the heavens, filled with wrath and ferocity, as he roared, "Yue Hao, come out!"

"You killed my people. I swear I won't rest until I kill you!"

His aura surged through the world, carrying a savage and ruthless presence. "You beast! I kill you, and you dare to resist? You even dared to kill my people. Yue Hao, kill yourself, and then kill that Yu Xi, and I might spare your worthless life!"

Boom!

With a resounding crash, Su Yu shattered a mountain with a single palm strike, exuding an overwhelming aura of menace. "Flatten the inner perimeter of Chaos Mountain, clear all obstacles. I want to see the lair of these beasts!"

"Yes!"

With Su Yu's command, a rumbling echoed as mountains were leveled one after another. Su Yu and his powerful allies demolished mountain after mountain. Even the Chaos Ancient Beasts on some of these mountains were mercilessly slaughtered on the spot!

At this moment, a tiger and a dragon from the north and south looked at each other from afar, accompanied by numerous ancient beasts, yet they did not intervene. Meanwhile, Su Yu and his top-tier companions rampaged unchallenged, flattening mountain peaks one after another.

Su Yu laughed harshly, "Once I flatten your den, let's see where you can hide!"

Boom!

Su Yu punched the heavens, shattering a figure in the void. At that moment, Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, a massive gate covering the sky, reflecting across the myriad realms!

"Ambush me? Spy on me? Dream on! Do you think your pathetic Gate of Hell can spy on me?"

"You dogs dared to kill my people. Do you know when I, Su Yu, have ever suffered a loss in the Upper or Lower Realms? I've killed dozens of Daofuse cultivators and multiple Heavenly Kings. Who dares to kill my people? You have some nerve!"

"You're courting death!"

The frenzied Su Yu was truly mad, his aura boundless, sweeping across the world. The entire inner perimeter of Chaos Mountain was stirred into a storm of dust, the scene of giant mountains being blasted apart!

...

At this moment, within the inner perimeter of Chaos Mountain, surrounded by mountains, a grand hall stood filled with powerful figures. Yue Hao's face was grim, and the old ancestor's expression was not much better. "He's back!"

Su Yu!

He had inquired about the heavy losses last time and found out who was responsible.

Su Yu!

The Human Lord of the Lower Realm!

The new Human Lord of this tide.

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis knew, and so did they.

This invincible presence in the Lower Realm had suffered his first setback here, although their losses were greater, losing a Heavenly Sovereign, multiple Heavenly Kings, and dozens of Daofuse cultivators.

But now, clearly, this madman felt he had been wronged.

It seemed he had never suffered such a loss before.

Now, he had returned with his subordinates for revenge.

"March, Giant Axe, Xuelan, Tongtian, and last time, that dog from the Culture King!"

"This Su Yu himself is stronger than last time, having reached the Heavenly Sovereign domain!"

"Indeed, such a child of destiny, if not killed, only grows stronger with each battle!"

Those who become Human Lords are all children of destiny.

They just didn't expect the revenge to come so quickly. The troublesome part was that once they acted, besieging Su Yu and his group would inevitably provoke the myriad races to act as well.

The old ancestor frowned slightly and said, "The urgent task is not to deal with these people but to receive the Senior Sister!"

Senior Sister!

Yes, to receive the one behind the Gate of Hell, the Control King's direct disciple.

A true master of the power of laws!

But now, Su Yu was causing chaos, pushing forward relentlessly, making it difficult to decide whether to intercept him or not.

The old ancestor frowned slightly, then quickly said in a deep voice, "Yue Hao, Yue Luo, you two go over there. Don't aim to solve the problem, just block them! If they truly flatten everything on the front line, it will be even more troublesome! Also, what are the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Tailless Dragon thinking? They said they would help us block the myriad races, but now that Su Yu has acted, why haven't they?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon claimed they were here to help block the myriad races, giving them time to receive their Senior Sister.

After all, she was a powerful chaotic presence behind the Gate of Hell.

Naturally, a chaotic powerhouse could be considered an ancestor of the Chaos Ancient Beasts.

But at this moment, those two had not stopped Su Yu and his group.

Was it not part of the plan, or what?

Below, Yue Luo and Yue Hao exchanged glances. Yue Luo giggled, "Old Ancestor, there are more than just two Heavenly Sovereigns."

"Just block them. If there's real danger, someone will naturally assist!"

Alright.

The two exchanged a glance, and Yue Luo chuckled, "Then let's follow the Old Ancestor's orders."

...

Soon, Yue Luo and Yue Hao flew out from the Control King's lair, swiftly heading towards Su Yu and his group.

...

At this moment, Su Yu sensed two powerful auras and immediately laughed, "Damn, they look down on us, huh? Only two came?"

Too few!

Although both auras were strong, Yue Luo's aura seemed comparable to Fat Ball's when it was blackened, perhaps even stronger.

Indeed, the Control King's lineage still had many powerful figures.

And Yue Hao's aura, Su Yu had encountered it before. He knew the opponent was strong. Last time, Fat Ball hadn't blackened and wasn't a match, getting beaten half to death!

"Good, Yue Luo is mine. Fat Ball, you guys, kill that Yue Hao. Let them underestimate us. Maybe on the first day, we can kill a Heavenly Sovereign for fun!"

Su Yu tore through the void, heading straight for Yue Luo!

At the same time, March, Giant Axe, Fat Ball, Xuelan, and Tongtian all flew towards Yue Hao.

Their speed was incredibly fast!

In the blink of an eye, Su Yu shattered the void, arriving in front of Yue Luo, who, upon seeing Su Yu, brightened her eyes and smiled charmingly, "Such a handsome young man... Sister..."

"Screw you!"

The moment Su Yu saw Yue Luo, he disliked her. No other reason, just disgust.

Just thinking of Lantian raising an orchid finger at him made Su Yu want to beat Lantian to death. Unfortunately, Lantian was one of his own, and recently, Lantian rarely transformed into a charming woman, preferring to become a little girl.

"I'll smash you to death!"

Su Yu hadn't used a big hammer in a long time. At this moment, the big hammer appeared instantly, the Expanding Spirit Hammer, once Su Yu's signature battle technique.

Now, he swung the hammer out!

Boom!

The void shattered, the Expanding Spirit Hammer targeting the sea of will. At this moment, the hammer was ablaze with sky-burning flames, scorching the sea of will. With one swing, the world seemed to collapse!

Boom!

Yue Luo had just finished smiling when she was met with a massive hammer. She quickly retreated, letting out another charming laugh, "Little brother..."

"Die!"

Su Yu instantly went berserk!

Boom!

The big hammer shook the world, a thunderous roar, and all around, giant mountains collapsed, the universe quaking!

With a splutter!

Yue Luo retreated thousands of meters, spitting blood, her face bewildered.

Crazy!

I'm so polite, so cute, so kind. This smile, this laughter, it's all a kind of dao, a power of the Great Dao, specifically to influence others. Even a Heavenly Sovereign would be disturbed by it.

Yet, this madman Su Yu, the more you influence him, the crazier he becomes.

"Disgusting!"

Su Yu roared in anger, "I hate your kind the most, neither male nor female, hideous and disgusting scum! I'll slaughter you!"

Yue Luo was almost infuriated to death!

You're the disgusting one!

And from afar, Giant Axe's voice came, laughing heartily, "His Majesty's taste is indeed the same as mine. This woman is too ugly, truly disgusting!"

This was the first time Yue Luo had been called disgusting by two men in succession.

Giant Axe was one thing; Yue Luo found him disgusting too.

But Su Yu, this young man, this handsome guy, actually found her disgusting as well.

Yue Luo was furious, her aura shifting, instantly becoming gentle. In an instant, countless illusions appeared around Su Yu.

"Brother Yu..."

"Ugh!"

Su Yu almost vomited, his rage boundless, "You wretch, you're courting death!"

Boom!

The big hammer shattered the world!

It crazily attacked Yue Luo!

Yue Luo was dumbfounded. Why?

Could it be that Su Yu isn't a man?

Moreover, these are illusions, all of Su Yu's thoughts, all in line with Su Yu's desires. Why is it like this?

"Blue Yue Luo, I'll slaughter you!"

Boom!

The hammer of the Great Dao, frantically pounding, drove Yue Luo to madness. Why?

Her power of the Great Dao was almost useless against Su Yu!

In an instant, Yue Luo fell into a disadvantage.

In the blink of an eye, a massive hammer struck her, causing her to spit blood madly. She let out a furious cry, and a long sword flew out. As soon as it flew out, Su Yu roared, and the big hammer transformed into thousands!

Boom!

With a crash, the long sword was smashed to pieces.

Yue Luo immediately looked pitiful and weak, "Emperor Yu..."

"Screw you, here it comes again!"

"Die!"

At this moment, Su Yu went berserk again, here it comes!

Blue Yue Luo, don't think I don't know you're an old man. I'll kill you!

Boom!

The thunderous roar echoed across the heavens. In an instant, more intense than the battle of the four Heavenly Sovereigns on the other side, with a thunderous boom, Su Yu seemed stimulated, erupting, and with a thunderous roar, a hammer sent Yue Luo flying millions of meters, blood gushing out!

Yue Luo was stunned!

Why?

Also, my surname isn't Blue!

"Old Ancestor!"

She had no choice but to scream. This madman, not only powerful but also not a man. A normal man, seeing her Great Dao influence, would have long fallen into the trap. Yet, the more she exerted her Great Dao, the more Su Yu went berserk!

Driven to madness!

He had been infuriated by Lantian many times, and each time, Su Yu wanted to hit him, but in the end, he held back.

Today, Yue Luo dared to pull this trick on him!

I'll beat you to death!

The big hammer covered the heavens, driving Yue Luo into constant retreat. Yue Luo fled, and at this moment, Yue Hao was also fleeing madly. Last time, Fat Ball had beaten him up, and today, it went berserk.

Instantly blackened!

After blackening, the powerful Fat Ball lifted its boots with both paws and charged at him.

This time, it wasn't just boots!

In the void, collars, balls, chains, all sorts of treasures erupted, even pots and pans appeared, transforming into weapons. In the blink of an eye, Yue Hao was battered and bruised!

Yue Hao and Yue Luo had barely joined the battle when it became clear that without reinforcements, they were doomed. Deep within the chaos, even the ancient ancestor was shocked, urgently shouting, "Reinforcements, assist in the battle!"

What madness!

These four lunatics were far stronger than anticipated.

...

On Ren Mountain, everyone was in a daze.

They... they just charged in?

They had just ascended to the Upper Realm!

These lunatics truly had no fear of death!

In an instant, everyone exchanged glances, unsure whether to join the fray.

It was completely unexpected!

Su Yu and his group had not only initiated a fight but had directly attacked the enemy's stronghold!

This was sheer madness.

The enemy's ancestor was still there!

And that was a supreme powerhouse!

...

In truth, Su Yu wasn't afraid of that ancestor.

He hadn't even used his full strength yet.

But why reveal everything on the first encounter? Just to entertain the myriad races?

At this moment, he quickly transmitted a message, "Force them to use the Gate of Hell. Tongtian, be ready. Once they use it, latch onto it, and no matter what, take a bite out of it. Killing them might be hard, but devour the Gate of Hell for me!"

Tongtian was instantly overjoyed, quickly replying, "Rest assured, Your Majesty. Even if I die, I'll take a piece of them with me!"

The projection of the Gate of Hell was a treasure!

Would Yue Luo and Yue Hao use it?

Of course!

The ancestor hadn't arrived yet, and they were on the verge of being beaten to death by these lunatics. They were overwhelmingly powerful, and without reinforcements, they were truly finished. The two quickly retreated, initially thinking Yue Luo and Yue Hao were strong enough to face the four Heavenly Sovereigns. But it turned out, among Su Yu's group, the supposedly strongest, Giant Axe and March, were actually the weakest.

What a nightmare!

At this moment, Yue Hao's head was nearly split open by a boot, his hair disheveled, his body covered in blood. He roared furiously, and a portal appeared, opening wide to trap the boot within!

And at that moment, Marquis Tongtian's eyes gleamed brightly!

There it was!

He knew it—following His Majesty meant there was meat to eat!

Indeed, on the first day in the Upper Realm, there was already something to feast on.

Last time, he hadn't had the strength to partake, nor the means. But this time... the opportunity had come!

In that instant, Marquis Tongtian swiftly transported himself to the portal, transforming into a massive gate, larger than the shadowy portal, and swallowed the Gate of Hell whole!

Yue Hao was stunned!

In shock, he attempted to shake the Gate of Hell, but a bamboo, an axe, and a giant mouth attacked him simultaneously!

Yue Hao was terrified!

He fled in haste, trying once more to control the Gate of Hell, but the three powerful figures pursued relentlessly, forcing him to abandon control and flee again.

Yet at that moment, a thunderous roar erupted from Marquis Tongtian's direction!

"Devour!"

Boom!

Inside, the Gate of Hell exploded, and a vast amount of special power surged into Marquis Tongtian's body, causing him to roar continuously.

At this moment, where the true Gate of Hell resided, it suddenly trembled!

...

Simultaneously.

Yue Hao's forehead suddenly burst open, and he screamed in disbelief.

"Impossible!"

The Gate of Hell wasn't a tangible object, merely a force. Yet now, this special power had been devoured!

With a bang, his brow exploded again!

Boom!

Seizing the moment of his explosion, the three powerful figures attacked. A bamboo shattered his head, an axe cleaved his body, and the massive mouth swallowed his flesh. Just as his sea of will was about to be devoured, a piercing cry rang out, Yue Luo's shrill scream echoing painfully.

Everyone's eardrums vibrated!

Yue Luo appeared instantly, grabbing Yue Hao's sea of will. Meanwhile, Su Yu swung a hammer, smashing Yue Luo's left side into pieces.

With a hum, Yue Luo vanished.

The ancestor swiftly approached.

"Retreat!"

Su Yu grabbed Marquis Tongtian from behind, and in the blink of an eye, they vanished with the other Heavenly Sovereigns.

At that moment, the world fell silent!

And the ancestor roared in fury, "Su Yu!"

It had all happened in an instant!

Yue Hao's Gate of Hell was shattered, his body destroyed, his sea of will saved by Yue Luo, who wasn't much better off, her left side pulverized by Su Yu's hammer!

It was too fast!

Completely unexpected!

"Hahaha! Old fool, you killed Yue Hao and Yue Luo for me. Yes, now add Yue Luo to the list!"

Su Yu's voice echoed through the heavens, "This is just interest! You dared to kill my people! Courting death! I will kill you, and if you can't, then obediently let us go. How dare you retaliate and kill my people!"

Su Yu roared like a madman, "This is just a small interest, the first time. Today, I've just ascended to the Upper Realm. This time, I've sealed the lower realm passage and will fight you to the end! Let's see how it goes!"

"If you don't kill Yue Hao and Yue Luo and send them over, I will never open the lower realm passage. Do you think I'm like those soft-hearted myriad races? In the lower realm, I fought a thousand battles in three years, once a day. Just wait!"

"......"

Such a frenzied declaration, at this moment, even the ancestor's expression changed.

...

Simultaneously.

On Ren Mountain, the Heavenly Sovereigns hadn't even decided whether to intervene when the battle ended.

Yue Hao was severely injured!

Yue Luo was lightly injured!

At this moment, Mo Tianzun couldn't help but ask, "Is he always this crazy?"

Demon Halberd thought for a moment, nodding, "Always! As long as he can fight the opponent, he'll keep fighting, keep killing, keep attacking!"

This was no lie.

As long as Su Yu felt he could gain an advantage, he would keep fighting.

Demon Halberd sighed, "He's been this relentless before! Back when he hid in the ancient city, he would come out to kill whenever he could, until he couldn't kill anymore! He's both crazy and calm, as you saw. When the ancestor appeared, he fled instantly, without hesitation. He's always been like this!"

Su Yu was crazy, but also very calm!

Once he gained an advantage, he would retreat instantly.

Demon Halberd smiled bitterly, "He'll strike again, this won't be the last time. He's full of energy, never tires, today is just the beginning!"

Everyone was speechless.

The Heavenly Sovereigns exchanged glances, momentarily at a loss for words!

No wonder the lower realm couldn't handle Su Yu!

Facing such a relentless opponent was indeed a headache.

The myriad races knew Su Yu had borrowed their momentum; otherwise, the Control King's lineage would have pursued him. But... wasn't it satisfying?

At this moment, the myriad races felt quite pleased.

Let Su Yu borrow momentum!

They hadn't done anything, and Su Yu's group had already crippled two Heavenly Sovereigns!

These two weren't weak!

And at that moment, a booming sound erupted, an aura surged, and in the distance, after devouring the Gate of Hell, Marquis Tongtian advanced!

A Heavenly Sovereign's Gate of Hell, cultivated over many years, was devoured, allowing this second-class Daofuse to advance to Heavenly King!

"Hahaha!"

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian's wild laughter echoed.

"Kill!"

"Your Majesty, kill them!"

"Do it!"

"Take down that ancestor, devour his Gate of Hell, and I can become a Heavenly Sovereign!"

"......"

This was Marquis Tongtian's voice, and Fat Ball, at this moment, was also extremely excited, "Kill that Yue Hao, kill him, he hit me last time!"

At this moment, less than a hundred miles from Ren Mountain, these people were screaming madly, their voices echoing across the entire mountain.

In an instant, millions of people turned to look in that direction.

Madmen!

A whole group!

They advanced during battle!

Now, Su Yu's side had four Heavenly Sovereigns and two Heavenly Kings!

And at this moment, Su Yu's voice resonated, "Release the Iron Devourer Race, or else, declare war!"

"Declare war!"

"Declare war!"

"......"

The voice shook the heavens.

Echoing across Ren Mountain!

At this moment, Tiangu appeared, frowning slightly, "He's doing it on purpose!"

Yes, Su Yu was definitely doing it on purpose.

But... Tiangu knew that without releasing the Iron Devourer Race, this lunatic, though intentional now, would certainly find other ways to cause trouble, even if the enemy was the Control King's lineage!

Saint Marquis appeared, with a heavy expression, "He's not weak, not much weaker than me. Should we release the Iron Devourer Race?"

At this moment, several Heavenly Sovereigns looked at each other.

Release or not?

Su Yu and his group had come and given everyone a show of strength!

We are powerful, we are crazy, we are not afraid of death, we advance during battle, we fear nothing!

Four Heavenly Sovereigns, two Heavenly Kings.

Unrestrained!

No burdens!

They came alone!

At this moment, someone sighed, "Release them! Keeping the Iron Devourer Race is useless, can we really restrain them? Would these people really be restrained? Besides March, who else would be restrained?"

"But if Su Yu's recklessness gets these people killed, March will turn against Su Yu... should we try..."

Someone had just spoken when Su Yu's laughter echoed from afar, "Release them quickly, or else... we'll attack Ren Mountain! Control King's lineage, how about we cooperate to destroy the myriad races first?"

"......"

Damn it!

This lunatic!

Do you believe we'll join forces with the Control King's lineage and take you down first?

Do you really think it's impossible?

And the next moment, Su Yu laughed again, "Control King's lineage... hahaha, Marquis Tongtian devoured your gate and seems to have obtained some incredible information. Are you trying to bring out the ruler of laws? Big secret, huh? Work with me, and I won't expose your secret!"

"......"

Boom!

On Ren Mountain, auras surged.

Deep within Chaos Mountain, the ancestor's face changed, suddenly looking at the just-emerged Yue Hao, his face turning livid!

Yue Hao's expression was stiff; Marquis Tongtian had devoured his Gate of Hell projection and could actually obtain some information!

Damn it!

This was more troublesome than his severe injuries!

...

"Su Yu, is this true?"

At this moment, from Ren Mountain, Yue Tianzun's voice echoed, and Su Yu laughed, "You guess if it's true?"

"......"

No guessing!

Nine out of ten, it's true!

If so, joining forces with the Control King's lineage against Su Yu would be a joke, impossible to ally with!

The next moment, the voice of Moon Heavenly Sovereign echoed, "Release them! Su Yu, there's no need for conflict between us at this moment. The Iron Devourer Race are not prisoners; they merely reside here. If they wish to leave, then... let them go!"

In the blink of an eye, Marquis Giant Bamboo and his companions swiftly carried a massive mountain, flying towards Bamboo Mountain!

"Hahaha!"

A group of powerful beings laughed heartily, their voices shaking the heavens and earth, utterly unrestrained and wildly exuberant.

...

At this moment, atop Ren Mountain, Thunderstorm couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy. Cultivation, cultivation—reaching the level of Su Yu and his group was truly liberating.

Release them or not?

If not, then I'll fight!

Yet, Su Yu had chosen the perfect moment. If you turned against him now, you couldn't afford the consequences!

Because the Control King's lineage was actually summoning a master of laws!

This news immediately made the myriad races wary.

No, they couldn't allow it!

So at this moment, they absolutely couldn't turn against Su Yu and his group.

Thunderstorm felt envious. March had openly betrayed them, yet the myriad races dared not touch a single hair of the Iron Devourer Race, for on that side, there were a few powerful madmen.

As for himself... the Giant Race, he couldn't take them away. It was impossible!

Even though Hundred Battle was strong, it was useless; the myriad races did not fear Hundred Battle.

Hundred Battle might not even be that crazy.

...

Meanwhile, Tiangu glanced towards Su Yu's side, understanding in his heart that Su Yu wasn't actually insane.

But so what?

He wasn't insane, but would you dare not release them?

The people of the lower realm knew that if you truly refused, Su Yu was genuinely capable of attacking Ren Mountain.

"We are constrained at every turn... because we are too cautious, not crazy enough, not crazy enough to remain calm!"

Tiangu muttered softly, "Madmen aren't frightening. What's frightening is that this madman, while being crazy, is also incredibly calm. Just one mention of the Control King's lineage releasing a master of laws instantly dispelled the myriad races' hostility towards Su Yu!"

This is true capability!
