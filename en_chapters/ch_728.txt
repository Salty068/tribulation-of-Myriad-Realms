Chapter 728: The Sacred Race (Request for Monthly Votes)

While Su Yu was reaping opportunities in the Luminous Domain Mansion, events were unfolding in the Upper Realm, at the Source of the Dao.

After a day of waiting, both Mo Tianzun and Yue Tianzun found it unbearable to remain any longer. The immense impact of the River of Time was draining, even for them. After a day inside, they had to withdraw due to the significant consumption of their strength. As for whether Su Yu was dead or alive, they had no idea.

In the Upper Realm, the fall of a powerful figure did not cause any phenomena. All phenomena occurred at the moment of death, when the Great Dao collapsed and the power of laws exploded, creating a vortex of rules. If someone died elsewhere, unless they were of the same race or path, it was impossible to detect.

To them, Su Yu appeared to be a powerhouse of the Chaos Race. Whether he was dead or alive, only those of the Chaos Race, or those on the same path, could truly know.

...

Mo Tianzun and Yue Tianzun emerged from the River of Time. They were unsure of Su Yu's fate. Logically, he should be dead, but if he had truly opened the Heaven Gate... such a peerless genius might have a large destiny, making him hard to kill.

At this moment, they had no other choice. The two of them stepped out of the River of Time. In the blink of an eye, several figures appeared around them. These included Ming Tianzun from above the Great River, Huang Tianzun who had been buried in the earth, and Mo Tian, a Tianzun-level powerhouse who had been in a sealed slumber on the Mountain of Seals.

Including the two of them, there were five Tianzun-level powerhouses present.

Mo Tianzun stepped out, frowning slightly as he grasped the situation. He asked, "Did he escape?"

Huang Tianzun, who had awakened from his slumber in the earth, nodded slightly, exuding an aura of authority without anger. "He escaped. After all, he is Hundred Battle, the limit under the rule of the Lord of Rules. Even if one seal remains unbroken, he is not someone who can be easily killed."

He continued, "However, he paid a significant price. In the short term, he probably won't be able to act. The only thing he can do is break that last seal."

Speaking of this, Huang Tianzun added, "That seal is not simple. The so-called Chaos Lineage... could it be related to the Control King's lineage?"

He looked at the others, uncertain. "Back then, that woman sealed Hundred Battle. I suspect her methods might be the sealing technique of the Control King. For so many years, Hundred Battle has been unable to break free. Now, with the emergence of the Chaos Race... could there be a connection between the two?"

He felt it resembled the style of the Control King from back then. The sealing technique was extremely powerful! This was evident from the Control King's sealing of the February Great Dao, rendering it impossible to manifest or cultivate.

Ming Tianzun frowned slightly, "Regardless of whether it is or not, this lineage... is very terrifying! Moreover, Hundred Battle managed to escape..."

He smirked coldly, "Let him escape! Hundred Battle is impulsive by nature and has been sealed for many years. If he seeks revenge on the Chaos Lineage, that would be ideal! If not, given his character, he might gather all the human forces together... which would be even better, allowing us to capture them all in one fell swoop, preventing a repeat of the events from six thousand years ago!"

Letting Hundred Battle escape was no big deal. If he sought trouble with Chaos Mountain, that would be best. If not, Hundred Battle, unable to contend with them now, would likely try to rally his old troops. Marquis Dingjun and others had mingled with Chaos Mountain and might all be dead now.

Hundred Battle might also seek allies or simply wait for the Lower Realm to open, to gather the humans there, though there might not be many strong ones left.

But these people knew that Hongmeng and others had gotten involved with the humans of the Lower Realm.

It would be best if Hundred Battle exposed all the humans' trump cards and foundations, allowing them to be captured all at once, preventing a repeat of the past six thousand years where humans were scattered and hard to eradicate.

Upon hearing this, Yue Tianzun softly said, "Hundred Battle's strength is still formidable, so we must be cautious!"

Ming Tianzun replied indifferently, "That was six thousand years ago. Back then, the soldiers' den and others have all died! Now, he stands alone. What can he achieve by relying on himself?"

Mo Tianzun chuckled, "What if he allies with Chaos Mountain?"

At this, the group exchanged glances and suddenly laughed.

"That would be a great joy!"

Even Yue Tianzun couldn't help but laugh, "If he allies with Chaos Mountain, that would be ideal! If Hundred Battle joins Chaos Mountain, the hidden Chaos Mountain can no longer remain hidden. Hundred Battle is impulsive and accustomed to leadership. Who would lead Chaos Mountain? If he leads, there's nothing to fear. If not, can he really bow down and serve as a vanguard for Chaos Mountain?"

The group laughed heartily.

However, the next moment, they all restrained their laughter. Mo Tianzun softly said, "Chaos Mountain... this lineage might be more terrifying than we imagined! We once speculated that there might be some people hidden in the shadows, but now, you've seen it..."

This time, eight Tianwang-level powerhouses were killed. The other side only lost one Tianwang.

Of course, two others might have died as well. Even so, an 8 to 3 ratio was a huge loss.

But if that one truly opened the Heaven Gate, it might be a different story, perhaps not a loss.

As he spoke, Ming Tianzun asked, "What about those guys?"

Mo Tianzun shook his head, "They rushed to the end of the Giant Wave Land. Yue Tianzun and I guarded for a day, but we couldn't withstand the impact of the giant waves. The other side vanished without a trace."

"Then they must be dead."

Ming Tianzun said, but Yue Tianzun did not give a definitive answer, softly saying, "Not necessarily. The end of the Giant Wave Land is unknown to anyone. I once suspected it might be related to the River of Time or have some special significance, the true River of Time? Or the River of Time of the Lower Realm? In any case, without seeing a corpse, we cannot be sure they are dead."

The group pondered, nodding slightly.

Soon, Huang Tianzun exhaled, causing waves of rules to ripple, and said solemnly, "Alright, since those people have been forced to the end of the Giant Wave Land, let's consider them non-existent!"

Huang Tianzun said gravely, "I sensed in the Sealed Mountain that a quasi-king named Ziyan from the other side died! The strength of the Chaos Lineage is currently hard to determine, but they should not be stronger than us, or they would have emerged long ago!"

He continued heavily, "But they are indeed not weak. The Myriad Race Council must convene quickly to decide on dealing with the Chaos Mountain Lineage! Otherwise, the loss this time is too great, and it will be hard to explain to the various races!"

He added, "This time, our races lost eight quasi-kings, while the other side lost three, plus several Daofuse-level... though the losses are severe, the other side also suffered significant losses!"

Huang Tianzun concluded, temporarily characterizing this attack, and soon added, "Additionally, we must pay attention to one thing... the later rules of the Great Dao... there are some issues."

At this, everyone frowned.

Huang Tianzun said gravely, "You all sensed it too. At the last moment, the aura of Hongding and others plummeted, and even the power of the Great Dao dissipated..."

He was heavy-hearted, "The later replaced Great Dao, we had examined before, seemed somewhat superficial, but we didn't think it was too problematic and could even provide an opportunity to enhance everyone's strength. Now it seems we underestimated the trouble within! The Chaos Lineage might have a method to target this. If so... we must eliminate them, or else, the number of strong ones who have switched Daos is not just one or two!"

Everyone was somewhat solemn; this matter needed attention!

They had indeed sensed it!

If the Chaos Lineage could truly target those who switched Daos, then the Chaos Lineage must be exterminated. Many strong ones from various races had switched Daos, some with extremely high strength, and the increase in quasi-king-level powerhouses was greatly related to these rules of the Great Dao.

If targeted, at least one-third of the Daofuse Realm would be unable to exert their combat power, which would be an enormous loss.

Mo Tianzun also nodded, "This matter indeed deserves attention! Additionally, March and Tianming need to be watched carefully. Tianming is fine, as he never had any involvement with Hundred Battle back then, but March, who came here earlier, might have intentions of rescue."

The group looked towards the distance, where there was a mountain, the mountain of March.

Mo Tian cackled, "Since Hundred Battle escaped, why don't we join forces and kill March first, to prevent him from having other thoughts!"

Mo Tianzun softly said, "March is simple-minded but cunning, not easy to kill! If we really want to kill him, it's not impossible, but... the Chaos Mountain Lineage hasn't been thoroughly investigated yet. If we engage March now, and one of us falls, it would only benefit Chaos Mountain! March might be willing to help the humans, but not necessarily Chaos Mountain, especially since the sealing of Hundred Battle back then was closely related to this lineage. Moreover, the depletion of human foundations was also their doing..."

At this, Mo Tianzun chuckled, "Spread the news, the grudge between Hundred Battle and Yue Luo, the truth of the human race's downfall, let it all be known! Back then, to maintain the dignity of the various races, this matter was sealed. Since Hundred Battle has escaped... let it be spread! I want to see, with the Myriad Races knowing, the humans knowing, that the Chaos Mountain Lineage is the culprit behind the depletion of human foundations, whether Hundred Battle has the face to ally with them?"

"If they do ally, I don't believe the humans have all turned spineless, with none daring to resist? If there's internal strife, that would be best!"

"Hundred Battle trusted human traitors, blinded by lust, leading to the collapse of the human race. I want to see if the current humans still dare to remain loyal to him!"

Mo Tianzun smiled faintly, "Those human allies, including this March, would they dare choose Hundred Battle? Having lost once, squandering the human foundations, losing again, how much more of the human heritage is there for him to squander?"

The group exchanged glances and all smiled.

To kill and destroy the heart!

Spread the news so that the Upper Realm knows, the Lower Realm knows. Is there not a single human with a backbone?

If there is, then the Chaos Mountain Lineage and the humans cannot unite.

Even though the human strength is not as strong now, who knows if there are still hidden foundations?

Just like this Source of the Dao, who can guarantee there are no dormant powerhouses among the humans?

The Lower Realm's human race, previously capable of killing Marquis Meteor and others, undoubtedly still possesses some Daofuse Realm experts, including figures like Doubao and Hongmeng. Would they dare to ally with the Hundred Battle King?

"Agreed!"

Several individuals nodded, deciding on this course of action. If the Hundred Battle King had escaped, they would spread the news to create chaos. If he hadn't been unsealed or escaped, there was no need to say anything. With him sealed, many believed he was dead. Spreading the news might instead lead to the rise of a new Human Lord, a new savior.

With the consent and manipulation of several Heavenly Venerables, the news quickly spread throughout the Upper Realm. The Chaos Race officially emerged. Three quasi-kings and numerous top-tier Daofuse experts entered the Source of the Dao to unseal the Hundred Battle King. In the ensuing battle, eleven quasi-kings died, and more than a dozen Daofuse experts perished. All those who unsealed the Hundred Battle King fell!

Moreover, secrets from the battle six thousand years ago began to circulate. Back then, the Hundred Battle King trusted the Chaos Race's expert, Yue Luo, and was betrayed, leading to his sealing in the River of Time. This betrayal resulted in the deaths of over a hundred Daofuse experts from the human race and its allied races!

Now, the Chaos Race unsealed the Hundred Battle King merely to use him and the remaining humans as their pawns and vanguard! To provoke the Hundred Battle King, rumors even suggested that despite his downfall due to Yue Luo, he might still cooperate with her, risking another defeat for the human race just to win her favor, willingly serving as the Chaos Race's vanguard!

These rumors spread like wildfire, even causing disdain among some powerful figures of the myriad races. The Hundred Battle King! Wasn't one betrayal enough? Would he really escape only to collude with Yue Luo again and betray the human race once more?

The news was the talk of the Upper Realm. The affairs of the Hundred Battle King and the Chaos Race overshadowed even the deaths of numerous quasi-kings. As for the Hundred Battle King's escape, this was not the past. Alone, he couldn't support the entire situation. Moreover, after his sealing, the myth surrounding him was shattered. The myriad races no longer feared him as much.

Let him escape! With rumors of his betrayal and lustful nature, he was naturally looked down upon, losing much of the reverence once held for him.

---

Iron Devourer Race.

When the news broke, Marquis Giant Bamboo's expression changed. In the grand hall, several Daofuse experts also looked grim.

Dead?

They all turned to Jiuyue, who seemed indifferent and shook his head. "It's definitely a rumor. Emperor Yu's strength aside, his means of survival are numerous and terrifying. How could he fall so easily?"

He continued with a smile, "If he truly fell, there would be some commotion, the power of laws would explode. Now, there's no such commotion. They say he perished in the River of Time, but I don't believe it! Emperor Yu opened the Heaven Gate and sees the River of Time clearly. Others might die there, but not him!"

Jiuyue added, "Even if he couldn't escape, with Emperor Yu's character, he would fight to the death. Those pursuing him would be killed, even if it meant mutual destruction!"

Jiuyue didn't take the rumors seriously at all. If Su Yu truly had no way out, he would self-destruct and take a piece of the enemy with him, not remain silent without causing a ripple.

Marquis Giant Bamboo pondered and asked, "Do you trust him that much?"

Jiuyue shook his head. "It's not about trusting him. The ancestors should trust what they see. Initially, our Iron Devourer Race didn't believe he could win. Ancestor June helped him only due to our alliance and because he learned the Iron Devourer Seventy-Two Castings... We never expected the outcome to be like this!"

"Before, did Ancestor Giant Bamboo believe Emperor Yu could kill eight Heavenly Kings? As for the deceased Ziyan, she was actually an enemy, making it nine! To this day, the myriad races remain in the dark, foolishly targeting the Chaos lineage..."

Jiuyue chuckled, "So why worry? Rest assured, if Emperor Yu is fine, he might soon come to Bamboo Mountain! There are still many humans in the Upper Realm, and Emperor Yu won't abandon them."

Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others remained silent.

Beside Jiuyue, Full Moon expressed concern, "Jiuyue, I heard the Hundred Battle King has been unsealed. If he comes to our Iron Devourer Race, how should we handle it?"

Jiuyue laughed, "Serve him good food and drink, then inform Emperor Yu and let him decide! Just stall for time. There's no need to befriend or oppose the Hundred Battle King. As for alliances, there's no need to bother!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo laughed, "So just stall him?"

"Of course!"

Jiuyue replied matter-of-factly, "Not to mention his unclear ties with the Control King's lineage, even if he had none, between choosing the Hundred Battle King and Emperor Yu... the ancestors know who to choose! Moreover, the news suggests Emperor Yu might have reached the Heavenly King Realm. If so, why care about the Hundred Battle King?"

"Our alliance with the human race isn't to court death!"

Jiuyue spoke confidently, "Since our alliance with the human race, Emperor Yu has brought only benefits. As for the Hundred Battle King... he owes me my grandfather's life! And the Control King's lineage killed my second ancestor, a deep-seated grudge! How could we cooperate with the Hundred Battle King?"

His grandfather, July, was killed while aiding the Hundred Battle King, a fact Jiuyue remembered well.

April nodded slightly, "Indeed, it's unwise to ally with the Hundred Battle King. Jiuyue's words make sense. Just stall him. If he truly comes, there's no need for hostility. After all, the Hundred Battle King is powerful."

The Iron Devourer Beasts quickly reached a consensus. As for whether Su Yu was dead or not, they decided to wait and see. Jiuyue firmly believed he was alive, and after some consideration, Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others agreed it was quite possible. This new Human Lord was a ruthless individual. When tasked with killing three Daofuse experts, he killed eight Heavenly Kings instead.

If they assumed he was dead and acted accordingly... they had to be cautious of the consequences.

---

The entire Upper Realm was abuzz with discussions about these events. Meanwhile, the Chaos Race and the Control King's lineage, at the center of the controversy, were in turmoil.

---

Deep within Chaos Mountain, in a vast valley plain resembling a new world, an ancient hall echoed with angry shouts!

"Useless!"

"A bunch of useless fools!"

"Damn it, why did this happen?"

"Ziyan is dead. How did she ascend?"

"If she ascended, why didn't she contact us?"

"They say Ziyan unsealed the Hundred Battle King. Where did the other two quasi-kings come from?"

"......"

The roars continued.

Though the Control King's lineage was extremely low-key in the Upper Realm, they weren't completely cut off from information. Otherwise, they wouldn't have known about the previous attack on the Dragon Race.

At this moment, the powerful figure referred to as the ancestor was furious. "I felt something was amiss with the Dragon Race attack! I didn't expect that in just a few days, everything would change, and the entire Upper Realm would know of our existence!"

"After ten thousand years of patience, why couldn't we endure the final moments?"

The ancestor was enraged. Soon, someone softly said, "Ancestor, please calm down. This tide was something our race planned to act upon. It was hard to conceal. Aunt Yue Luo's actions back then already alerted the myriad races..."

"Nonsense!"

The ancestor's angry shout interrupted the middle-aged man, "Knowing is one thing, but the myriad races didn't know the details. They thought we were only a few dozen or a few hundred, with perhaps only a few Daofuse experts! Now, after killing nine quasi-kings and eight Daofuse experts... even a fool knows our race is powerful and will be on high alert. Is that the same?"

Yue Luo's actions back then did expose some things. However, it was just Yue Luo alone. How could the myriad races know the true strength of this lineage? For so many years, they hadn't discovered much, thinking this lineage consisted of only a few individuals hiding somewhere. Who could have guessed the true strength of this lineage?

Now, after killing nine quasi-kings of the myriad races, who would believe you if you claimed to be weak?

The ancestor, still furious, coldly said, "Something's not right. Ziyan is dead, but the specifics are unknown! However, how did Ziyan ascend? That's one question! Second, if Ziyan truly ascended, she wouldn't act rashly unless coerced. Otherwise, why would she risk her life to save the Hundred Battle King?"

"Third, who are the other two quasi-kings? Did they come from the Lower Realm? If so, does the Lower Realm have quasi-king level existences?"

"Fourth, the myriad races are now convening a council to discuss how to deal with our race. This is our greatest loss!"

"Fifth, the Hundred Battle King has been unsealed... With his character, he will surely seek us out for revenge on Yue Luo! Although still sealed, his strength remains formidable. Escaping from several Heavenly Venerables, even sealed, he is terrifyingly powerful..."

They had been schemed against!

The ancestor had already guessed as much. Taking a deep breath, he looked at the silent crowd in the hall and asked, "Who do you think is orchestrating all this against us?"

The crowd found it difficult to determine.

Did the Lower Realm possess such strength to scheme against them?

Soon, a young woman softly suggested, "If we were truly schemed against, could it be the last member of the Torchbearer lineage?"

Her words caught everyone's attention.

The woman continued softly, "Don't forget, there are only two paths from the Lower Realm to the Upper Realm. The first is through the Fate Clan, and the other... the Torchbearers should control one!"

The ancestor nodded slightly, "The Torchbearers had three leaders. Bingku and Danyu have fallen, but the core figure is said to be alive and hasn't appeared! Back then, Yue Luo asked the Hundred Battle King to invite this person out of seclusion. Bingku said that person was the true leader of the Torchbearers, and they could die, but not him... In the end, the Hundred Battle King had no choice but to give up."

The Ancestor furrowed his brows slightly. "If that's the case, then the situation in the Upper Realm of Ziyan can be explained. The leader of the Torchbearers, with the power of a Heavenly Sovereign, might not be weak... Capturing Ziyan and using her as leverage makes sense."

"As for the two quasi-kings assisting Ziyan... they might be remnants of the Torchbearers!" The Ancestor took a deep breath. "Based on these clues, Ziyan was likely captured by the third person of the Torchbearer lineage, or she outright betrayed us, leaking information and leading to today's scheme!"

With a mix of anger and helplessness, he realized they had been outmaneuvered.

In the grand hall, the middle-aged man who had spoken earlier spoke again, "Ancestor, even if we try to argue now, it might be... difficult to make our case!"

"Argue?" The Ancestor replied coldly, "Would you believe your enemy's argument? Would you believe the words of those who have hidden for a hundred thousand years? Would you believe those who sealed the Hundred Battle King are good people?"

In truth, if they were the myriad races, they would dismiss it as nonsense!

Ridiculous!

They had hidden for a hundred thousand years, made numerous moves, sealed and unsealed the Hundred Battle King, and killed many quasi-kings. Now, claiming to be the good guys, who would believe them?

The old man didn't dwell on it further and said sternly, "Summon everyone outside to return immediately! Those in seclusion, prepare to emerge! Once the Myriad Races Council convenes, dealing with us might soon be on the agenda! Previously, the myriad races dared not venture deep into Chaos Mountain, but now, they might!"

"Try to stir up the ancient beasts on the periphery, gather them together to prevent the myriad races from picking them off one by one. If they unite, the myriad races will have to pay a hefty price to kill them!"

"Prepare for war!" The old man said coldly. "Moreover, whether the myriad races believe it or not, leak the information. At least let both the myriad races and us be prepared for the possible existence of a third party, namely the Torchbearer lineage!"

He continued, "Also, be wary of the Hundred Battle King..."

The middle-aged man hesitated, "Should we... let Yue Luo try again with the Hundred Battle King..."

The old man was silent for a moment before nodding, "I'll notify Yue Luo. Even if she can't subdue the Hundred Battle King, she must at least keep him occupied to prevent him from causing us trouble!"

"Since we can't hide or conceal... let the world know just how strong our Sacred Race truly is!"

The old man suddenly stood up, his aura immensely powerful, filling the grand hall. "In the past, our king, the Control King, made great contributions to the Human Race! He pacified the Devil Realm, suppressed the Abyssal Realm, and quelled the Dragon Race... His merits were no less than those of the Culture King! Yet, the Culture King, that sycophant, bullied others with his power. The Human Emperor failed to recognize talent, listened to slander, and punished our king, showing incompetence!"

"Since the Human Race does not accept us, we shall establish our own race, the Sacred Race!"

"Now, the world has changed. Our race has accumulated a hundred thousand years of history, with countless strong individuals. This myriad realms... should respect our Sacred Race!"

The old man spoke passionately, "Six thousand years ago, the Hundred Battle King was incompetent, leading to the Human Race's defeat! Over the past six thousand years, the Human Race's fortune has declined, while our race has flourished. The Human Race's fortune has shifted to us, and our land is rich with talent, filled with powerful individuals! Now, since we can't hide, we shall emerge and let the myriad races know that our Sacred Race is the true master of these myriad realms!"

In the grand hall, the powerful figures were also filled with momentum, their excitement palpable as they echoed his sentiments loudly.

The middle-aged man laughed heartily, "Whether it was a scheme or not, the fact remains that nine quasi-kings of the myriad races have fallen, and two quasi-kings of the Torchbearer lineage have perished, reducing the number of quasi-kings by eleven in an instant. These are facts! The power of the myriad races has been significantly weakened, and heaven favors our Sacred Race!"

Whether it was a scheme or not, it was no longer the time to investigate.

However, on the side of the myriad races, including the Dragon Race's Blood Dragon Marquis, nine quasi-kings had indeed died!

They were dead, which meant their strength had weakened, and that was true.

Otherwise, if this third party hadn't emerged, these people could still fight.

The old man laughed!

From this perspective, it was much more comforting. Yes, regardless of the circumstances, the myriad races' strength had been greatly reduced, and that was a fact!

It's just a pity about Ziyan...

No, she deserved it!

That useless person might have betrayed them; otherwise, how could the Torchbearers have framed them so easily?

It's unknown whether the plans to unseal some powerful beings in the Death Realm and subdue the West Heavenly King and others were completed.

The old man thought to himself and stopped pondering further.

Ziyan was dead, and now everything was unknown. Once the lower realm opened, the situation would naturally become clear.

The old man quickly dismissed everyone, considered for a moment, and stepped into the void.

Moments later, he appeared in an extremely dark place.

There, a massive black portal was present.

Near the portal, many powerful auras were revealed.

Here was the core of his lineage.

It was also the place the Control King guarded in the past, the Gate of Hell!

In the darkness, as the old man arrived, some opened their eyes, some greeted him, and some were curious...

But the old man walked straight ahead.

Soon, under the massive portal, a woman with an exceptional figure appeared before him.

Sensing the old man's arrival, the woman opened her eyes, filled with unparalleled tenderness, looking at him. Without speaking, her gaze alone was captivating.

"Ancestor..." The woman's voice was soft, carrying an indescribable sense of pity.

The old man glanced at her, a hint of desire in his eyes, quickly replaced by calmness. He spoke softly, "Yue Luo, your strength is becoming more terrifying."

"Ancestor, you flatter me."

The woman smiled gently, causing the old man to show a hint of infatuation again, but he quickly regained his composure, taking a deep breath. "The Hundred Battle King has been unsealed! Except for your last seal, all the myriad races' seals have been broken by him!"

Yue Luo spoke softly, "Has he... come out?"

With a touch of tenderness and some nostalgia, she said softly, "That's wonderful. I regretted sealing him back then. Ancestor, has he come out?"

The old man pretended not to hear Yue Luo's words. Don't take her words seriously!

"I came to find you..."

"Ancestor, no need to say more."

Yue Luo sighed softly, "I'll go see him. Back then, it was my fault. Let him do as he wishes, as long as he understands my heart. I did it for the race, and he did it for the race... It's just unfortunate that we were destined to be apart..."

The old man suppressed his agitation and quickly said, "Prepare yourself. Even if you can't suppress him, you must keep him occupied!"

He continued quickly, "Moreover, the third person of the Torchbearers might have appeared! They schemed against us. If possible, have the Hundred Battle King deal with him... Of course, if it's not possible, forget it..."

Yue Luo said softly, "Ancestor, how can you be so heartless? The Hundred Battle King has just been unsealed and needs to recuperate."

The old man didn't respond. He knew Yue Luo's situation and didn't want to say more. Finally, he said, "Leave the Hundred Battle King to you. The myriad races might enter Chaos Mountain. Our race currently lacks the energy to deal with the Hundred Battle King..."

After speaking, the old man turned and left. Behind him, Yue Luo said somewhat resentfully, "Ancestor is leaving so soon? Yue Luo hasn't even had a chance to be intimate with Ancestor..."

The old man left even faster!

In the entire dark place, others were cultivating together, but only Yue Luo occupied the Gate of Hell alone, with no one else around.

After leaving the Gate of Hell's range, the old man shouted, "Prepare for battle! Be ready to emerge at any time!"

"Understood!"

Around him, voices responded.

The old man felt much more at ease and quickly departed.

He had just left when, in the darkness, the delicate Yue Luo emerged, and the surroundings fell silent.

"A bunch of heartless people!" Yue Luo spoke with a tender, coquettish tone, mixed with some resentment. How could you treat me like this?

Instantly, some felt pity, desire, and impulsiveness, wanting to respond.

Soon, someone nearby coughed lightly, shaking the void, instantly calming those people down.

Yue Luo, with a heartbroken expression, said resentfully, "Forget it, forget it. I'll go find the Hundred Battle King. You heartless people are truly bad!"

After speaking, Yue Luo's face showed a charming smile, completely different from her previous delicate demeanor.

Once she disappeared, a sigh of relief echoed around.

Someone exhaled, "Yue Luo is finally gone. She's becoming more terrifying!"

"The Hundred Battle King has been unsealed? Well, Yue Luo will have her fun now. It's good; let Yue Luo play with the Hundred Battle King."

"The Hundred Battle King might even fall for it... that fool..."

"Let's not talk about him. It seems a great war is coming. Everyone, prepare yourselves!"

The voices gradually faded.

In the depths, as Yue Luo left, several eyes seemed to appear on the massive portal, gazing out from behind the door.

The eyes were cold and filled with chill.
