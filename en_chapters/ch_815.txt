Chapter 815: A Strike to the Heart! (Please Subscribe)

On this day, Su Yu dealt with two powerful beings using a unique method. Unlike his previous direct and aggressive approach, this time he declared, "I command the heavens and earth! Within my domain, I am omnipotent. Those weaker than me, those whose power of laws is inferior, will be easily suppressed by me!"

At this moment, Su Yu thought of the Myriad Realms and the Death Realm. Was this how the Lord of Time and the Lord of Death operated? Yes, it must be so! In their domains, they were invincible, easily suppressing anyone weaker than themselves. To transcend them, one must open the heavens! Without doing so, one would be easily suppressed, for their paths still lay within the River of Time.

...

Within the heavens and earth.

The Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger sealed themselves, faces full of despair. They had been captured so easily, it was frustrating. Moreover, Su Yu hadn't even made a move. Was this the speed at which those who opened the heavens progressed?

Moments later, Su Yu's domain contracted, transforming into two chains that bound the dragon and tiger together. The Eight-Winged Tiger lamented, "Emperor Su, we've already sealed ourselves. Why bind us?"

"Because you're not trustworthy," Su Yu replied nonchalantly.

The Chaos Dragon glanced at the Eight-Winged Tiger with frustration. Did you hear that? Because of your untrustworthiness, we're bound!

The Eight-Winged Tiger, equally frustrated, chose not to pursue the topic further. Being dragged along by Su Yu, it sighed, "Emperor Su, what do you want us to do? We are willing to go through fire and water for you!"

"You want to devour Yu Qing, don't you?" Su Yu asked.

"Not devour her. We don't eat people; we consume chaotic will!" the tiger clarified cautiously, fearing a misunderstanding that might lead to their demise.

Su Yu didn't care for their explanations and nodded slightly. "You two know too many of my secrets."

"Understood!" The Eight-Winged Tiger quickly responded, "Knowing too much leads to a quick death unless one is an insider. We are insiders now! Whatever His Majesty commands, we shall do!"

Su Yu smiled, "The wise adapt to circumstances..."

"To become heroes!" the Eight-Winged Tiger interjected.

Su Yu cast a silent glance at it and said after a long pause, "Interrupt me again, and I'll have a feast of dragon and tiger."

Silence fell.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was dejected, and the Chaos Dragon almost slapped it. Show off again, and you'll get us killed!

Ignoring them, Su Yu continued, "Chaos Dragon, you've fought against the ancient Human Kings. Your strength isn't weak. Against an average ruler of laws, it might be difficult, but with the Eight-Winged Tiger, you could contend with a fourth or fifth-tier ruler."

"Fourth or fifth tier?" the Chaos Dragon pondered.

"The ancient Human Kings' physical bodies are considered fifth-tier."

The two powerful beings understood. The Chaos Dragon thought for a moment and said, "We could manage, as long as the opponent's path isn't too unique. Some paths are special, with many methods despite not being strong in combat. We can't handle those! Most of the Chaos Ancient Clan follow martial paths."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "So, you two just need to intimidate the Divine Consort for me."

"The Divine Consort? She's weak..." the Chaos Dragon began, but Su Yu interrupted, "She's become a ruler of laws!"

"How is that possible?" The Chaos Dragon was shocked, and the Eight-Winged Tiger was equally surprised, "Your Majesty, how could that be?"

"I helped her advance," Su Yu explained.

The dragon and tiger were momentarily stunned. What did this mean? You helped her advance, and now you want us to intimidate her? What kind of logic is this?

Su Yu added, "I also released the Martial Emperor."

Well, they had guessed that much.

Su Yu smiled, "This task is simple, isn't it? Just intimidate her. If the Divine Consort acts, you two handle her. It's easier than dealing with the Martial Emperor and me, right?"

The implication was clear: if they disagreed, they'd have to face Su Yu and the Martial Emperor together.

The Eight-Winged Tiger, feeling hopeless, resigned itself to dealing with the Divine Consort. "Naturally, we will follow Your Majesty's orders, but we would prefer to deal with Yu Qing..."

"That can wait!" Su Yu chuckled, "First, deal with the myriad races, then Yu Qing! Once you reach the Human Mountain, apply pressure step by step. I'll keep the myriad races under pressure, but once you're there, follow the Great Zhou King's orders!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger cautiously suggested, "Your Majesty, I have some wit. The Tail Dragon listens only to me and isn't friendly to others. Perhaps I should command..."

Su Yu turned back, looked at it calmly, and said, "Fine, I still need a pot of dragon and tiger soup."

The Chaos Dragon quickly interjected, "I'll follow anyone's orders!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger wanted to drag the Chaos Dragon down with it, but the dragon refused. Too risky!

Su Yu ignored them and continued, "Once you're sent there, will you run?"

"No!"

"Will you rebel?"

"Absolutely not!"

The dragon and tiger answered firmly. No, rest assured! We will obey!

Su Yu said nothing more.

Moments later, back in his domain, Su Yu suddenly reached out, and two light points appeared. He looked at the dragon and tiger and said, "Since you won't betray me, I'll place a tracking mark on you. No problem, right?"

The dragon and tiger exchanged a sorrowful glance. This was too pitiful!

"If you think you can escape my pursuit or even kill me, feel free to try!" Su Yu smiled, "In the current Myriad Realms, there are still a few factions, like the Hundred Battle King, the Sin Clan, and the myriad races!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger quickly replied, "We wouldn't dare! How could they compare to Your Majesty!"

This time, the Eight-Winged Tiger was earnest, "Your Majesty is an opener of the heavens. If we don't submit to you, we certainly won't submit to them! If we won't serve an opener of the heavens, why would we serve them?"

It wasn't foolish. If they were to submit, it would be to someone with greater potential and strength in the future. Ignoring an opener of the heavens to submit to the Hundred Battle King would be foolish.

"You do have some wisdom!" Su Yu laughed, "Alright, head to the Human Mountain now!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Once there, follow the Great Zhou King's orders and pressure the myriad races!"

"Understood!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon were indeed eager to leave Su Yu's presence. The pressure was immense, especially within Su Yu's domain, where they felt even more endangered. Previously, they were only within the range of Su Yu's domain, not truly inside it. Now they were directly within it!

They had no doubt that here, Su Yu could easily kill them.

The dragon and tiger were eager to leave, desperate to escape the overwhelming pressure of being near Su Yu.

Su Yu nodded slightly, and two light points landed on them, disappearing instantly. The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger dared not resist, feeling helpless. It was over for them.

"Go!" Su Yu waved his hand, and the two vanished instantly. The pressure was too great to stay.

...

Watching their disappearing figures, Su Yu smiled.

Would they rebel? Hard to say! But as long as Su Yu himself was unharmed, the possibility was low. Unless something happened to Su Yu, they would undoubtedly rebel at the first opportunity.

"We must gradually increase the pressure on the myriad races!" Su Yu chuckled, letting the myriad races slowly feel the threat of extinction.

...

Before the Human Mountain.

The duel continued.

This time, the duelists were Xia Longwu and a third-tier Dao-fusion expert from the God Race. Xia Longwu followed the path of the blade, while the opponent followed the path of ice and snow.

In the void, ice and snow covered the heavens and earth.

Xia Longwu seemed to be frozen!

The entire sky was frozen for miles, snowflakes falling, each one a harbinger of death. Xia Longwu was completely encased in ice.

Below, the Great Xia King wore a grave expression.

Xia Longwu had not long ago reached Dao-fusion, then directly fused with Su Yu's domain. Within Su Yu's domain, Xia Longwu possessed the power of a third-tier, nearly second-tier Dao-fusion expert, but that was within Su Yu's domain. Outside of it, Xia Longwu could only be considered a weaker third-tier.

The opponent, however, was a top-tier third-tier expert.

The path of ice and snow covered miles.

Xia Longwu seemed completely suppressed!

At that moment, a blade light reflected across the heavens and earth.

"Open the heavens!"

A soft shout echoed in all directions.

In the void, the expert of the ice and snow path's expression changed. The next second, the ice shattered, and a blade light sliced through the heavens and earth!

Buzz!

The void shattered, and with a squelch, the expert of the ice and snow path, encased in ice, couldn't withstand the blade and was cleaved in two, their body shattered.

In the sky, Xia Longwu stepped out, shattering the ice around him, coldly gazing at the opponent, and slashed again!

Destroying the body wasn't enough.

The opponent's path hadn't been severed!

Severing the path was the true way to kill!

On the Human Mountain, someone gasped, while Tiangu's people frowned slightly. Some wanted to intervene but hesitated, not daring to act rashly.

On the God Race's side, the Sun Corona Heavenly Venerable also frowned.

A third-tier Dao-fusion wasn't weak.

If killed, it would be a significant loss.

Should he intervene?

Just as he thought about it, his expression suddenly changed, choosing to remain silent.

Boom!

A loud noise erupted as Xia Longwu slashed again, turning the heavens and earth into chaos, a massive firework rising.

But at this moment, the top experts of the myriad races couldn't care about this.

With some uncertainty and a sense of foreboding, they looked towards the depths of chaos.

Soon, everyone saw two powerful auras rising.

The next moment, a dragon and a tiger flew swiftly. At this moment, there was some commotion in the Human Race's camp, but it quickly subsided as the Great Zhou King shouted, "Stay calm!"

He could communicate with Su Yu.

Lantian was here!

Indeed, Lantian nodded slightly but still transmitted, "Be cautious, stay alert!"

The Great Zhou King understood.

The next moment, the dragon and tiger, their massive bodies covering the heavens, arrived, the Eight-Winged Tiger roaring, "From the Luminous Domain Mansion, the Dragon and Tiger Kings come to aid in battle!"

Silence fell in all directions!

On the Human Mountain, Tiangu's people changed color.

The aura of the Chaos Dragon was overwhelmingly powerful. At this moment, its roar reverberated through the heavens and earth, "Dragons of the Myriad Realms, why do you not submit? I am the Chaos Dragon, the progenitor of your kind. Do you intend to betray your ancestors?"

On the Mountain of Men, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable furrowed his brows slightly. The Chaos Dragon wasn't lying. However, countless years had passed, and such claims need not be taken too seriously. Yet now, the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger had pledged allegiance to Su Yu! That was the truly terrifying matter!

The Divine Empress's expression also shifted slightly, her voice low, "If this dragon and tiger join forces... I'm afraid... it will be difficult to defeat them!"

Despite her recent advancement, dealing with these two would be challenging. Before her breakthrough, she had struggled against Moon Battle, and even in a life-and-death struggle, she could only hope to injure or severely wound Moon Battle, at the cost of her own life. Now, although she was much stronger than before, the Chaos Dragon alone was no weaker than Moon Battle, let alone with the Eight-Winged Tiger by its side.

Tiangu's expression changed. The pressure was mounting. Su Yu himself hadn't even arrived yet! At this moment, if a battle were to break out, the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon would face off against the Divine Empress, while Fat Ball was incredibly powerful. The Sun Corona and the Saint Marquis might not be able to match it alone and might have to join forces.

On Su Yu's side, there were still seven Heavenly Venerable-level beings. On their side, there were also seven: Moon Heavenly Venerable, Desolate Heavenly Venerable, Dao Heavenly Venerable, Dragon, Phoenix, Nether, and Origin Saint. However, Moon Heavenly Venerable and Dragon Heavenly Venerable had not reached their peak combat strength.

From a purely current perspective, the strengths of both sides were almost evenly matched, perhaps even slightly inferior! That was the terrifying part! There were surely more powerful beings on Su Yu's side yet to arrive.

...

At this time, outside the Kingdom of the Control King, Wu Ji and the others were also inhaling sharply. Su Yu had subdued the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger? This made things formidable!

Beside him, Thunderstorm's eyes were complex, his thoughts shifting unpredictably. Su Yu subduing these two wasn't surprising; after all, he was an opener of the heavens, more powerful than anyone had imagined.

Wu Ji inhaled and said, "How did these two Chaos Ancient Beasts come to serve Su Yu? Could it be a feigned allegiance?"

It was hard to speculate! But with this development, the pressure on the Myriad Races was bound to increase!

Wu Ji grinned, "If this continues, when Su Yu arrives, will he launch a full-scale attack?"

It was hard to say! No one could predict Su Yu's intentions. This was only the second day of besieging the Myriad Races. Yet on the second day, the Myriad Races already felt immense pressure, and it was still early in the three-month period.

...

This was the second day. On the third day, under the shocked gazes of the crowd, another Heavenly Venerable aura erupted from the Soul Burying Mountain region. A low chuckle reverberated in all directions!

"From the Luminous Domain Mansion, Wan Tiansheng, here to assist in the battle!"

Another Heavenly Venerable joined the ranks, and suddenly, the pressure on the Myriad Races reached its peak. Another Heavenly Venerable combatant from the Luminous Domain Mansion had arrived! Wan Tiansheng had truly stepped into the Heavenly Venerable realm.

On the Mountain of Men, Tiangu closed his eyes, deep in thought. Another one had come! They hadn't all arrived on the first day to exert immense pressure but were coming one by one. What was Su Yu trying to do?

Soon, he realized something, opened his eyes, and said calmly, "He wants to extinguish our fighting spirit!"

Everyone felt a chill. What did he mean?

The Divine Empress, however, understood and sighed, "He's gradually dismantling our will to fight! If all these powerful beings had arrived on the first day, we would either fight to the death or prepare for annihilation. Whether we fought or not, we would know how strong his side truly was..."

"But now, the duel continues, and we have no reinforcements, while their side grows stronger and stronger..."

In this way, it would cause a psychological blow to everyone! Invincible! Moreover, during the duels, the newly advanced powerhouses on Su Yu's side were not weak, contrary to what one might imagine.

These newly advanced powerhouses had all fought their way up; there were very few who had risen purely by luck.

The Divine Empress looked at Tiangu, "Do you think they have more powerhouses?"

Tiangu thought for a moment and nodded, "There must be more. Hongmeng hasn't appeared yet!"

Now, on Su Yu's side, there were already ten Heavenly Venerable-level beings: Fat Ball, Lantian, Wan Tiansheng, the Great Zhou King, March, Giant Axe, Destiny, Tongtian, plus the Dragon and Tiger duo. Are there more? There must be!

Moreover, they wouldn't all come at once but would arrive one by one, dismantling the fighting spirit of the entire Myriad Races. As Wan Tiansheng's aura surged, there was already some commotion on the Mountain of Men.

Restlessness began to spread across the Mountain of Men. Could the Luminous Domain Mansion of the Human Race be matched?

These arrivals did not engage in battle but hovered in the sky, intimidating all directions. The more they did so, the more despairing it became. If it had been the first day, not knowing their strength, they might have dared to fight. But by the third day, they were hesitant to fight.

On the first day, everyone had the mindset of breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats. Today, however, was the third day of the duel, and according to the Great Zhou King's words, the duel would last for three months! After three months, there would be a decisive battle.

So, should they resist now or wait for an opportunity three months later? At this moment, even among the Heavenly Venerables, some were uncertain and found it difficult to choose.

Tiangu glanced around and sighed. He knew that this might be the only opportunity. But... should they gamble? He didn't dare! He could only delay, waiting for a change to occur. But he also knew that if this continued, things would become increasingly difficult, and something would eventually happen.

At this moment, Tiangu felt an overwhelming pressure that made it hard to breathe. He struggled, several times wanting to say, "Charge out and seize an opportunity." Charging out might prompt the Control King's lineage to take action, or Hundred Battle might act against Su Yu, but... he didn't dare.

Tiangu's eyes were filled with bitterness. After all these years, had even his courage been worn away? If it were just him, he would dare. But here, on this Mountain of the Myriad Races, lay the foundation of the various races, the roots of the Immortal Race, and tens of millions of powerful beings. If they were annihilated, the lower realm would become nothing more than lambs to the slaughter!

What to do?

...

On the third day, Wan Tiansheng arrived. On the fourth day, another incredibly powerful aura erupted. Su Yu's side welcomed the 11th Heavenly Venerable powerhouse!

Hongmeng!

Hongmeng's true form appeared, a massive Old Turtle that blotted out the sky and the sun.

"From the Luminous Domain Mansion, Hongmeng!"

The 11th Heavenly Venerable powerhouse had arrived! His aura shook the heavens and earth! A giant mountain hovered, the Dragon Coil Mountain from before.

...

"Wow, so many?"

At this moment, Wu Ji and the others were also shocked. How many had come already? There were already 11! Su Yu's side hadn't been accumulating for long, so where did all these powerhouses come from? Although many were ancient powerhouses, their side also had ancient powerhouses, and these guys weren't this formidable before!

Wu Ji was surprised, "Do you think there are more?"

The familiar ones seemed to have all arrived, right? Were there more Heavenly Venerables under Su Yu's command?

Everyone looked at each other, unsure. Blood Shadow hesitated slightly, "Probably... no more, right?"

Would Su Yu appear personally tomorrow? And then, would the full-scale attack commence soon? None of them could be sure!

Suddenly, Wu Ji said, "Do you think that woman on Su Yu's side, the one in the fire armor, does she look familiar to you?"

Everyone looked at each other, and after a long while, Marquis Nanshan suddenly said, "Familiar!"

Very familiar! But it was hard to guess, and they didn't dare to guess. Because... she looked very much like the long-dead Marquis Lanshan from years ago. Moreover, her aura was powerful, vaguely possessing the combat strength of a Heavenly King.

Not only that, but beside her was a strong fire dao expert. Some ancient beings, if they saw him, would also find him familiar. He was the Heavenly Fire of the long-extinct Fire God Clan. Of course, not many recognized him now, but Heavenly Fire's aura was also extremely powerful. His aura was comparable to Lanshan's, vaguely resembling a Heavenly Venerable, but his specific aura was more like a Heavenly King peak.

Regardless, the two of them together could certainly contend with a Heavenly Venerable, everyone thought. It was a terrifying strength!

At this point, everyone was curious whether more powerhouses would arrive on Su Yu's side on the fifth day. The Myriad Races' side was already so tense that it could almost drip water!

Each powerhouse was incredibly heavy-hearted. Hongmeng had arrived, but were there more?

...

Yes! The fifth day arrived in the blink of an eye. Today, another formidable aura soared into the sky.

"From the Luminous Domain Mansion, Qi Rong!"

A faint, cold voice echoed, and a surge of thunderous power rose. Qi Rong, the Consort of King Qi! Qi Rong appeared in all her splendor, stepping through the air. In Su Yu's world, she was second only to the South Heavenly King, her strength surpassing both Marquis Lanshan and Heavenly Fire. She had emerged and vaguely possessed the power of a Heavenly Venerable!

She walked through the air, looking into the distance, towards Wu Ji and the others, with a hint of coldness and disdain!

"I am Qi Rong! I have returned!"

"Consort of King Qi!"

At this moment, Wu Ji and the others' expressions changed slightly. The Consort of King Qi was still alive! She was a powerful figure executed during the third tide, the consort of the third Human Lord. Not only was she alive, but she had also stepped into the Heavenly Venerable realm and had joined Su Yu!

Back then, most of the ancient powerhouses who forced Yue Gang to kill Qi Rong had perished, but some still lived. Wu Ji had never forced Yue Gang, but Long Brow under Hundred Battle had. And now, the Consort of King Qi had arrived!

Qi Rong, in her splendid attire, with a formidable aura, looked towards the Myriad Races' direction and let out a cold laugh, "Why do you not return!"

Under the astonished gazes of the crowd, suddenly, from the Myriad Races' direction, seven or eight pseudo-dao powerhouses struggled. In the next moment, someone roared and flew out of the Mountain of Men, while another let out a shrill scream, and their dao suddenly flew out from within, their aura disappearing instantly!

A pseudo-dao flew out of the Mountain of Men! Consort of King Qi reached out, and seven or eight pseudo-daos fell into her hand. She examined them and nodded slightly, "Not bad, well-nurtured!"

At this moment, everyone's expressions changed. Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others remembered something! Yes, Su Yu had once said that he could control pseudo-daos, but nothing had happened since. Whether it was intentional or truly overlooked, no one had mentioned it again.

Today, the Consort Qi made her appearance, instantly dealing with seven or eight Daofuse cultivators!

At this moment, Tiangu shouted, "Qi Rong, the Emperor Yu's Mansion agreed to a battle of generals. What are you doing now?"

Consort Qi replied indifferently, "Why all the noise? These pseudo-daos were gifts I intentionally gave them back then to nurture for me. They were mine to begin with. Taking them back is only natural, isn't it? His Majesty Emperor Yu did not seize any other pseudo-daos! Tiangu, are you unaware of this? Back then, His Majesty mentioned to Eclipse Moon and the others that he could control all pseudo-dao experts!"

Consort Qi continued calmly, "His Majesty, out of consideration for past promises, is unwilling to seize these pseudo-daos. That's why you all still exist. Otherwise, not a single pseudo-dao cultivator would survive! But that's His Majesty. As for my belongings, of course, I will take them back. Do you have any objections?"

"Impossible..."

"Is this true, my lord?"

At that moment, a group of pseudo-dao experts changed their expressions.

Could it be true?

Among the crowd, a six-winged member of the Divine Race wore a grim expression. He knew it was true! Back then, Su Yu had controlled him, forcing him into battle. Later, Su Yu relinquished control, allowing him to regain his senses. However, the higher-ups had kept this a secret, even issuing a gag order on him!

But today, it was exposed!

On the side of the myriad races, following the betrayal of the Demon Race and the withdrawal of the Fate Clan and others, coupled with the casualties from the last great battle, there were only about 150 Daofuse cultivators left.

That's still a lot!

Previously, at their peak, there were nearly 300!

But now, at least a third of them are pseudo-daos!

There are at least 50 pseudo-dao experts!

Among them, there are even two or three Heavenly King-level existences!

Now, everyone was in a panic. Could pseudo-daos be controlled?

Previously, if it was just talk, people wouldn't believe it.

But now, they had no choice but to believe. Consort Qi casually stripped seven or eight Daofuse paths, which was terrifying. Even in front of some Heavenly Venerables, they were stripped away!

At this moment, Moon Heavenly Venerable's expression changed as well. He said solemnly, "Su Yu once promised not to harm pseudo-dao cultivators..."

Consort Qi replied indifferently, "His Majesty will naturally keep his promise! We never said we would harm them... But that's His Majesty. I said these people were cultivated by me back then! These few paths are my private property!"

She smiled coldly, "Tiangu, you know, back then, I was executed by the Human Race! The reason was these pseudo-daos! They were the key to my execution. Given that, is there a problem with me taking them back?"

Tiangu's expression was grave as he said solemnly, "I have heard of that incident! Su Yu said that as long as we attacked the Sin Clan, he would not harm pseudo-dao cultivators... Last time, we killed many strong Sin Clan members! Since you, Qi Rong, want to take back your things... we acknowledge it! But will Su Yu break his promise next?"

He was worried too!

This matter was too unsettling!

A third of the strong are pseudo-daos, including himself. If Su Yu could truly control them... Honestly, he thought it would be troublesome and difficult for Su Yu to control them.

Even now, he still thought so.

But Qi Rong's casual gesture, causing seven or eight Daofuse to fall, was too terrifying!

It would shake people's hearts!

At this moment, denying it would be useless and would only make everyone more afraid.

More afraid!

So, he could only find a way to make Su Yu's promise public, to let everyone know that Su Yu had promised not to harm pseudo-dao experts!

Qi Rong smiled faintly, "That's His Majesty's business! Since His Majesty said it, he won't break his promise!"

Though she said so, people's hearts were truly uneasy!

Especially those pseudo-dao cultivators, each one was both shocked and afraid, fearing that the next moment they would end up like the others, suddenly dead, dying without knowing why!

Their paths were stripped away; how could they not die?

Qi Rong had no kindness in her heart. After stripping their paths, she didn't even help suppress the rampaging power of laws within them. The moment their paths were stripped, they either exploded to death or their sea of will collapsed directly!

Dead is dead!

Intimidating the myriad races is a good thing.

...

On Mount Ren.

A group of people wore grim expressions. Arrogant Heavenly Venerable could no longer hold back, gritting his teeth, "Let's fight! When will this end? Three months... I'm afraid we won't last three months before everyone collapses on their own!"

A battle of the hearts!

Su Yu, too ruthless.

Qi Rong must have done it on purpose, definitely!

Over a hundred Daofuse, a third have issues. How can these people dare to fight?

Moreover, 12 Heavenly Venerables have come from the other side!

Are there more?

If there are, everyone might despair.

Such pressure, one wave after another, relentless, leaving everyone breathless!

...

"So ruthless!"

Wu Ji clicked his tongue!

At this moment, Red Moon and the others nodded, each with a solemn expression. Su Yu's side truly had many methods.

Wave after wave of pressure, even as bystanders, they felt the despair of the myriad races.

The strong are increasing!

Pseudo-dao cultivators have no heart to fight!

On the fifth day, 12 Heavenly Venerables appeared. Are there more?

...

There are!

On the sixth day.

Another aura rose!

This time, the aura was even stronger, a presence that intimidated the heavens and earth, vaguely spreading.

"Emperor Yu's Mansion, Yu Ziqi!"

An icy voice spread!

South King!

This time, the four directions shook, and someone exclaimed, "South Heavenly King!"

"Revived from the dead!"

When South King appeared, everyone realized a problem they dared not think about: the dead, revived!

This is South Heavenly King!

Few knew the name Yu Ziqi, but that didn't mean no one knew.

When she announced her name, hearts trembled instantly.

On Mount Ren, even the Divine Empress was shocked, instantly floating to look at South Heavenly King, with some shock, "Yu Ziqi, you've been revived?"

South Heavenly King stepped through the air, carrying a faint coldness, "Revived! Did you just realize?"

It wasn't just realized; it was previously unbelievable!

South Heavenly King said indifferently, "Thanks to His Majesty's kindness, he brought us out from the Celestial River of Death, revived us. Dying in battle... is not frightening! The generals of Emperor Yu's Mansion, dying once, as long as they can be guided... they can live! The connection between the upper and lower realms, you wouldn't think it's just to make it easier for you to be surrounded and killed, right? Connecting the upper and lower realms is just to let the Celestial River of Death spread... to guide the fallen soldiers of Emperor Yu's Mansion!"

This statement was like a thunderbolt!

Heavens!

The other side can die and revive, which is equivalent to having two lives. If they die and revive, and die again, can they live again?

If they can, wouldn't that mean infinite revival?

Then... what's the point of fighting?

Fighting spirit, collapsed!

At this moment, even Tiangu couldn't suppress it. Below, a group of people was utterly desperate, and someone screamed madly, "This is impossible... they can revive after dying, what about us?"

"Then what's the point of fighting?"

"Heaven wants to destroy our myriad races!"

"What to do?"

"Surrender?"

"Surrender, and they won't accept us!"

"......"

Truly desperate, infinitely desperate.

The other side has 13 Heavenly Venerable-level existences, pseudo-daos can be controlled, and they can revive after dying...

These pieces of news completely shattered them!

Tiangu and the others' expressions changed.

This... the hearts of the people have collapsed, the morale has collapsed. Once a great battle breaks out, facing Su Yu's camp, there's no way to fight, the pseudo-dao experts are wasted, and the true dao experts probably don't dare to fight either.

Killing the other side is useless!

Tiangu roared, "Even if you revive, it's not that easy..."

South King waved her hand, and suddenly, nearly 20 strong figures appeared behind her.

Hetu appeared, Xia Chen appeared.

Hetu laughed eerily, "It's not easy, quite difficult. Last time, we only revived over 20. Marquis Lanshan and Senior Tianhuo, they all revived, and we were lucky to revive too!"

Hetu's laughter was cold, "I am Hetu, lucky to revive! In the first tide, you all didn't spare me, and now, I'm back!"

Tiangu took a step back, his face pale.

Not because of Hetu, but because... all the strong behind South King were revived!

All of them!

As if to confirm they wouldn't believe it, or to show that revival was difficult, but at this moment, over 20 strong were revived, what a joke, over twenty!

Is it really difficult?

Even Hetu revived!

Su Yu... too ruthless!

This isn't a battle of generals, Su Yu is waging a battle of the hearts, killing without killing!

He hasn't killed anyone yet, but he's already shattered their hearts!

The other side isn't afraid of death, they can revive after dying!

The other side is strong, with 13 Heavenly Venerables!

The other side still has people who haven't come, like Su Yu himself, he hasn't come. The key is, does Su Yu have more Heavenly Venerables under him?

Can't guarantee, can't be sure!

No one knows if Su Yu has more, even if not, at this moment, the myriad races are desperate, plus Su Yu, 14 Heavenly Venerable-level existences, even if they have a ruler of laws, can they match the other side?

South Heavenly King appeared, her aura was incredibly strong, vaguely similar to Fat Ball, Chaos Dragon, and others.

This is the terrifying part!

Is Su Yu preparing to win without fighting?

Tiangu looked up at the sky, with confusion, despair, pessimism... the myriad races, even the last bit of hope is gone, the hearts are scattered, the strong are afraid, they don't dare to fight to the death...

Because is fighting to the death useful?

Is self-destruction useful?

Blow up the other side, they can revive, who will revive you if you die?

Dying is dying for nothing!

And on the Human Race's side, morale was soaring, spirits were high, each one filled with killing intent!

Yes, we are too powerful!

We have over a dozen Heavenly Venerables!

We can die and revive!

What are we afraid of?

At this point, the gap between the two sides is too big, not just in strength, but also in morale, fighting spirit, in a battle of the strong, these things are also key, key to influencing victory or defeat.

The Human Race isn't afraid of death, the myriad races feel dying is dying for nothing, how can they continue to fight?

...

Not only the myriad races are desperate!

When South Heavenly King appeared, bringing over 20 revived strong, Wu Ji and the others fell silent instantly.

The Undead have revived!

Terrifying!

Or perhaps, it’s a catastrophic blow!

They suddenly wondered, can the Hundred Battle King and Su Yu's side win against this?

Most likely... most likely not, right?

Thirteen Heavenly Venerables!

That's five more than their side, no, counting Su Yu, six more. And on their side, they still have His Majesty, but can His Majesty really match up to six or seven Heavenly Venerables?

Wu Ji looked grave. "This South Heavenly King... is very strong! And that Fat Ball, the Eight-Winged Tiger, they're all very strong!"

By strong, he meant he might not be able to win!

As for the Chaos Dragon, he was definitely no match.

And he was considered the strongest under the Hundred Battle King, yet over there, he might barely make it into the top five.

"Don't forget... there's also the Martial Emperor!"

Red Moon said in a low voice, "With this Human Lord, we can only cooperate... not turn against him. I hope Chang Mei and the others won't incite His Majesty to make the wrong decision!"

Su Yu's side was now a force to be reckoned with!

At this moment, no one dared to underestimate Su Yu's side anymore, no one thought they lacked the ability to stand on equal footing with the Hundred Battle King!

They did!

Not only did they have it, but... they might even surpass the forces of the Hundred Battle King.

"Six thousand years of dormancy... and this is the result?"

In the crowd, Blood Shadow suddenly sighed, filled with confusion.

We have been dormant for six thousand years, and this is the result?

A human race without inheritance, without the protection of powerful figures, has erupted under Su Yu's leadership into a force stronger than ours!

This is the most terrifying part!

Six thousand years have become a joke!

The dormancy decision of the Hundred Battle King has also become a colossal joke!

...

At this moment.

In front of the Gate of Hell.

Mo Heavenly Venerable wore a complex expression, speaking in a low voice, "Can we... match them?"

Here, there are two rulers of laws, one being close to a ruler of laws, and himself, but... can they match the thirteen Heavenly Venerables on the other side?

At this time, the Poro Dragon Beast also became more solemn, quickly sneering, "Without becoming a ruler of laws, what are Heavenly Venerables?"

Of course, he said this, but if a real fight broke out, it would be troublesome!

The Poro Dragon Beast bared its teeth, "Yuqing, how about... we take out those guys outside and bring in one or two more!"

Take out Wu Ji and the others!

Bring in more rulers of laws!

Wu Ji and the others are just six Heavenly Venerables.

He alone wasn't afraid!

They must bring in more companions, otherwise, even the Poro Dragon Beast felt uncertain. Damn it, how did the human side suddenly have so many Heavenly Venerables!

In ancient times, the other side had many rulers of laws, and many ancient beasts trying to exit the Gate of Hell were killed.

In this era, the Poro Dragon thought it was very safe now.

He was supposed to be an incredibly powerful existence!

But when he really came out... he wanted to curse, damn it, humans are all beasts!

They said there were only a few strong ones, and in the blink of an eye, a bunch of Heavenly Venerables appeared!

Su Yu, this guy, is not easy to kill.

With so many subordinates, how to kill him?

"Also, contact the Myriad Races, see if we can cooperate..."

The Poro Dragon still suggested, having lived to this point, he wasn't stupid, at this time, maybe cooperation was the way!

Without cooperation, a single side really couldn't fight against them!

Yuqing remained silent, while Mo Heavenly Venerable's eyes were filled with complex emotions.

Originally, they thought the Control King's lineage was strong, but... after the Demon Race defected, two Heavenly Venerables died, and not long after, these two rulers of laws were considering cooperating with the Myriad Races.

If that's the case... what was the point of betraying the Myriad Races back then?

The two Heavenly Venerables who died, didn't they die in vain?

Had they known, they might as well not have defected!

Anyway, now they have to cooperate.

At this moment, Mo Heavenly Venerable was also feeling depressed, the two Heavenly Venerables of the Demon Race probably died for nothing, gaining nothing at all!
