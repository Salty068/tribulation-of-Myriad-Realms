Chapter 677: Awakening and Advancement (Seeking Subscription)

The encirclement of the North King's Domain continued unabated. Su Yu merely taunted them with words, never truly launching an attack, which gradually put the experts within the North King's Domain at ease. 

Thankfully, it seemed that this new Human Lord was temporarily unable to do anything to the North King. The so-called stripping of the throne had not succeeded, which somewhat reassured everyone.

Su Yu lingered for a while longer before speaking indifferently, "North King, I'm heading to the Realm of the Living to have some fun above your head. Leave the North King's Domain early, or else a few feet might come crashing down from above at any moment!"

With those words, Su Yu vanished.

...

Inside the North King's Domain, the North King frowned. Su Yu had left, but not without a parting threat. Was he really going to hover above them?

Among the fourteen Necrolord Princes, a demon race Necrolord Prince couldn't hold back and said in a low voice, "Heavenly King, he might be going to gather reinforcements. Why not take this opportunity while he's gone to break out? At worst, we can hide in the Celestial River of Death..."

They weren't even considering victory anymore! Although it seemed like they were evenly matched with the other side, both having a Heavenly King-level expert and over a dozen Necrolord Princes, the deaths of the East King and West King, along with that earth-shattering stomp, made these Necrolord Princes feel that victory was unattainable!

Even if they managed to defeat the South King and the others, it would still be difficult to claim victory. 

That dog hadn't even shown up!

The North King remained silent, leaning back in his chair and gazing at the sky. After a long while, he said calmly, "Escape to the Celestial River of Death?"

Below, another Necrolord Prince spoke up, "If that's not possible, then we should flee to the Endless Abyss!"

The North King furrowed his brows. An immortal race prince said solemnly, "My lord, I know you don't want to abandon the North King's Domain, as it's your fief! However... even if we win the war against the South King and the others, Su Yu will not let it rest. He might as well break the balance of the entire Death Realm! Rather than that, we should preserve our strength, break through, and enter the Abyss!"

The Abyss, also known as the land beyond the Four Kings' Domains, was an unclaimed territory. The Spirit Suppression Domain and the Reverent King Domain were surrounded by the Celestial River of Death, forming the center, with the Four Kings' Domains distributed around it. Beyond that lay the Abyss, the unclaimed land.

The North King was silent for a moment before speaking slowly, "The Abyss is even more dangerous! In the past, the Martial King led several Human Kings to conquer the Death Realm. The Martial King once ventured into the Abyss, but later returned and chose to abandon further conquest of the Death Realm, establishing the Four Kings' Domains..."

He continued, "The Abyss... I actually know a bit about it."

Everyone looked at the North King; they hadn't lived as long as the Four Heavenly Kings. They were ancient princes, but the North King existed even before ancient times.

A curious Necrolord Prince asked, "My lord, we've sent people to explore the Abyss before, but it only lacks some suppression from the power of laws. As for the undead, I don't think they're necessarily stronger than those in the Four Kings' Domains."

In the Abyss, there were no rules like those of the North King's Domain or the West King's Domain. The ancient imperial court's rules only governed the Four Kings' Domains and the Spirit Suppression Domain.

The North King said solemnly, "You don't understand! Back then, when the Martial King and the others came, they killed a large number of powerful beings, causing a change in the Celestial River of Death, with many powerful undead emerging from it! The Martial King was indeed powerful, leading several Human Kings and slaughtering countless undead, including several, if not dozens, of Heavenly King-level experts!"

Everyone was shocked. Was this true? They really didn't know!

The conquest of the Death Realm by the Martial King and the others was something the Human Kings did alone. Several Human Kings came to kill, and the myriad realms were unaware of the situation.

The North King continued, "The South King and I, recognizing the situation, chose to submit! But you must understand, during that period, there were countless powerful beings. Even though many Heavenly Kings were killed, it led to the emergence of even stronger beings!"

"The Death Realm has only one path, and everyone cultivates the Necro Dao. When many powerful beings are killed, some top-tier experts have the hope of advancing further!"

The North King spoke softly, "As far as I know, at that time, deep within the Abyss, a top-tier expert was born. I don't know if the Martial King killed them when he ventured in, but I do know one thing... no more Heavenly Kings were born afterward."

Someone was puzzled. What did that mean?

However, a clever individual had a change in expression, "My lord, do you mean that even if the Martial King could kill them, he wouldn't? Once they're killed, it would be endless. The Necro Dao is here, and stronger beings would continue to emerge! Killing and killing might eventually create a peerless expert, so... he chose to seal them?"

The North King finally felt some relief. Thankfully, not everyone was completely foolish.

He nodded, "That's right. I also suspect that back then, the Martial King didn't kill those experts. It's not that he couldn't, but that he shouldn't!"

If they were killed, the path would be cleared, and even stronger beings would continue to emerge!

The fewer top-tier beings, the more hope there is to reach the peak.

The Necro Dao is immensely powerful and cannot be severed!

In this way, the only option is to suppress!

At this moment, everyone understood the North King's meaning. A Necrolord Prince said solemnly, "So, my lord, are you saying that in the Abyss, there is one or several top-tier experts sealed?"

The North King nodded and sighed, "There probably are! They've been sealed! If they were dead, the South King and I should have made progress, perhaps even matching those ancient Human Kings who cultivated the physical Dao, but unfortunately, we haven't!"

The physical Dao could give birth to Human King-level experts, let alone the Necro Dao.

However, the Necro Dao had more fused Dao experts, and the accumulation over countless years meant the Four Heavenly Kings hadn't improved much.

Until the East King died, the West King died, and the North King and South King's strength began to rise.

"Sealed..."

Many Necrolord Princes looked at the North King. The North King said indifferently, "Don't even think about it. Even if they're sealed, it's not something you or I can handle. I'm just saying that the Abyss is more dangerous than you think! If those beings break the seal... going there would be seeking death! The Martial King has been gone for many years; does the seal from back then still exist?"

He wasn't sure.

In fact, over the years, he had sent people to the Abyss, but none had returned alive. It was a place of endless darkness, seemingly devouring everything.

Now, someone suggested fleeing to the Abyss. The North King thought it might be better to fight the South King instead!

The sealed beings must be extremely powerful, not only powerful but possibly also domineering, arrogant, and ruthless...

Why say that?

Because those who were more cowardly, like him and the other Heavenly Kings, had surrendered!

If those beings had also surrendered, the Human race, with its strength at the time, would likely have chosen to enfeoff them rather than seal them.

Such rebellious beings, the North King thought, would be insane to seek them out. If it came to that, he might as well surrender to the Human race; at least he could survive. Surrendering to the Abyss might not even guarantee his life!

Thinking about it, the North King quickly dismissed thoughts of the Abyss. Looking at the Necrolord Princes below, all trying to find their own way out, he suddenly felt a sense of a hero at the end of his road.

The battle hadn't even started!

These people were already thinking of running away. Where to run?

The Human race was powerful in ancient times, and everyone surrendered to them. But now, it's said to be the weakest tide of change for the Human race. Why... still like this?

"The Human race... truly domineering!"

The North King mocked himself inwardly. They were domineering to the extreme, killing and exterminating those who wouldn't submit!

He was merely a local overlord here, and over the years, he hadn't particularly targeted the Human race. He even had Human race Necrolord Princes under his command, which he hadn't interfered with before.

Su Yu... indeed, the geniuses of the Human race were all so domineering!

The Martial King was the same back then!

When he came to the Death Realm, he first killed three to five Heavenly Kings to intimidate the surroundings. If they didn't listen, he killed more until the Heavenly Kings were terrified. The majority of the powerful beings accumulated over countless years were killed, and finally, the Heavenly Kings submitted, and the Human race withdrew their troops!

At this moment, the North King looked towards the direction of the Celestial River of Death.

He was unwilling to go to the Abyss. If a great battle broke out and he couldn't defeat the opponent, should he flee to the Celestial River of Death?

He was born from it and knew something about it.

When he was born, he already had some memories, unlike the later monarchs who were born in a state of complete ignorance about the Celestial River of Death.

...

At the same time, Su Yu continued to traverse the void.

Soon, Su Yu entered the Celestial River of Death.

Crossing the Celestial River of Death, Su Yu shattered some undead that tried to grab him and quickly exited the river. On the opposite side, death energy surged into the sky, and a large number of undead monarchs were lined up. Shan Qi and the others were all present. The three Human race Necrolord Princes, upon seeing Su Yu, were somewhat shaken.

It seemed the South King had submitted.

At this moment, the three Necrolord Princes dared not say much. Zhengyang Prince quickly reported, "Reporting to the Human Lord, the undead monarchs revived near the Celestial River of Death have almost all been captured by us..."

Su Yu nodded and looked towards the center. At this moment, many dazed monarchs were still struggling, but they were being suppressed by a group of powerful beings!

Counting them, there were about thirty.

Su Yu frowned, "So many revived?"

"Yes!"

Zhengyang Prince said solemnly, "Indeed, quite a few have revived. Not only that, but we also encountered a Necrolord Prince! These monarchs have no memories, but that Necrolord Prince seemed to have regained quite a bit of memory. We had a brief conflict and felt pressured, so they quickly fled!"

Su Yu frowned, and Zhengyang Prince continued, "Now, we dare not delve deeper into the river. We've only captured this many from the periphery! Moreover, I vaguely sense some danger, so I asked Hetu to inform the Human Lord. The Human Lord should decide whether to continue capturing!"

Danger!

Su Yu looked towards the river. In fact, he also vaguely sensed some movement. It was unclear how many powerful beings had revived in this river.

Troublesome!

There might be Human race beings, or beings from other races.

That wasn't important. What mattered was whether they had stabilized their original intentions.

Even if they were Human race princes, once dead and newly revived, it didn't mean they could immediately stabilize their original intentions. That required time!

Without it, undead were extremely cold, filled only with anger, killing intent, and bloodlust.

Even Human race princes might attack you!

How many powerful beings had accumulated in the Death Realm?

Su Yu felt a sense of helplessness. He feared that the beings from the Death Realm would be endless, that the more he killed, the more would appear, dragging his side into a quagmire of war. A powerful path, he thought, must have nurtured countless strong beings.

He glanced at the resurrected necromancer lords. Some were monstrous in shape, clearly not of the Human Race, while others were humanoid, making it difficult to determine if they were human, celestial, or demonic.

"Are there any humans among them?" Su Yu asked.

Zhengyang Marquis nodded. "There are three, but their identities are unknown. We can wait a while and take them back to the East King's Palace. After some time, they might recover some memories."

He continued, "Additionally, the East King's Palace has a Heaven-Covering Mirror that can monitor the emergence of lords near the Celestial River of Death..."

Su Yu was slightly taken aback. He hadn't known about this. "What is this Heaven-Covering Mirror?"

In fact, Su Yu was unaware that earlier, when he first entered the Death Realm and fought alongside Hetu against the undead, they were being monitored. The East King's Palace's overseer had reported this to Lanshan Marquis, who chose to ignore it, being preoccupied in the Spirit Suppression Domain. Thus, the East King's Palace did not pursue the matter further.

Zhengyang Marquis, surprised by Su Yu's ignorance, quickly explained, "The Heaven-Covering Mirror was a gift from the ancient imperial court to the East King. Its main function is to monitor the emergence of undead. According to ancient agreements, powerful undead must be guided to the Four Kings' Domain, not left in the Spirit Suppression Domain."

Su Yu frowned. "A gift to the East King? What about the other three kings?"

"The other three kings don't have it. It was given to the East King because his domain is close to the Spirit Suppression Domain. Hongmeng doesn't like to move, and the Martial King was worried he would delay matters, allowing the undead to accumulate... In other areas, the Reverent King is stationed and can expel them at any time."

In simple terms, the East King was tasked with handling matters because the Martial King knew the old turtle was lazy. Thus, the East King's Palace was given a Heaven-Covering Mirror to monitor undead movements and guide powerful undead away to prevent them from impacting the living realms. The other areas, with the Reverent King present, had no such concerns. The Reverent King was much more reliable than the old turtle!

Su Yu was speechless. He quickly said, "So the Heaven-Covering Mirror can monitor undead? Does that mean the capture of these undead was done using it to locate the lords?"

Zhengyang Marquis nodded. "Partially, yes. But it can only monitor the undead in the eastern region of the Celestial River of Death. The other three regions are beyond its range."

Alright then.

Su Yu hadn't known about this before. Now, he exhaled slightly. "It's a relief that only the East King's Palace has it. If the other three royal palaces had it too, locating your presence would be troublesome."

If the North King's Palace had it, seeing so many powerful beings gathered here would certainly raise suspicions.

Quickly, Su Yu instructed, "Zhengyang Marquis, you three, head to the South King's camp immediately! Seal off the North King's Palace. Even if the North King breaks through, don't aim to kill, just trap them! Apart from preventing the North King from leaving, if you encounter a crisis, you can let other undead marquises escape!"

"Understood!"

The three undead marquises didn't say much and quickly departed.

Su Yu glanced at Hetu and then at the other guardians. "Escort these lords and follow me!"

Though their numbers weren't large, they would have to make do for now.

Among the 27 guardians, 21 were not at the ninth stage. They had captured nearly 30 lords, three of whom were human undead and couldn't be killed. For now, they would take them to the Luminous Domain Mansion and deal with them there.

"Luminous Domain Mansion..."

Su Yu pondered a question: Does the rule reward in the Luminous Domain Mansion consume the power of laws from the Myriad Realms?

This time, he wanted to create a large number of Daofuse cultivators. Su Yu worried about depleting the power of laws in the Upper Realm channel, which could open the Upper Realm!

"It shouldn't consume it, right?"

"The rule power in the Luminous Domain Mansion is incredibly abundant. If it were truly connected to the outside, the realm gates wouldn't even open!"

Su Yu thought to himself, planning to investigate carefully this time.

The Luminous Domain Mansion, the territory of the Human Emperor and the councilors, was likely self-contained. Otherwise, with so much rule power on the eighth floor, it would have overflowed long ago.

He hoped his judgment was correct. Otherwise, it would be a huge problem, as too many people needed to advance this time. If the power within the Upper Realm channel was drained, it would cause a major issue!

...

On the first underground floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion.

Su Yu expended a massive amount of power to teleport over a hundred lords inside.

Countless strands of hair did not stir this time. Instead, the giant pillars seemed to contract because... the Martial Emperor was awake, maintaining his consciousness, worried that Su Yu would pull his hair!

As Su Yu appeared, a face floated in the air.

However, no one else saw it. Only Su Yu could see it. He looked at the Martial Emperor's face, vaguely making out a cold visage.

"You're here again!" the Martial Emperor said coldly. Su Yu had only left a few days ago!

Su Yu nodded slightly at the Martial Emperor's face, ignoring him, and looked at Shan Qi, commanding, "Right here, kill a lord first. I'll observe and then decide!"

"Understood!"

Shan Qi quickly arranged it. Soon, a suppressed undead lord stood there, dazed and foolish, while a seventh-stage guardian stepped forward and punched, causing a loud explosion that shattered the lord!

The lord, being suppressed, was no match for these guardians!

In an instant, it was blown apart!

The undead mark shattered!

No rule power descended, indicating that this guardian was too strong, and killing a weak lord wasn't enough for a reward.

The Martial Emperor's large face frowned slightly.

Su Yu was ignoring him!

Indeed, Su Yu had no interest in dealing with him!

It was pointless!

With this time, it was more important to handle serious matters.

But the Martial Emperor was feeling quite stifled. This little bug was too arrogant. He said coldly, "Su Yu, what are you doing?"

"Continue killing!" Su Yu ordered. "Hurry up, we're on a tight schedule!"

"Understood!"

The guardian punched another undead lord, and soon, a wave of rule power descended. It was fairly dense, but compared to the reward when Heavendoom and the others killed undead marquises last time, it was far less.

Su Yu frowned slightly, observing closely, tracing the source of the rule power along the path.

He saw the rule power spreading from above.

Su Yu wasn't sure if it was coming from the outside or from the eighth and ninth floors!

Thinking of this, Su Yu's Human Lord Seal vibrated!

Moments later, a strong figure traversed through the void layer by layer. After a while, Tongtian Marquis's laughter echoed, "Greetings, Human Lord. You seem even more impressive than before! Have you come to break the eighth floor and let me out?"

Amidst the crowd's vigilance, a door appeared in the void.

Tongtian Marquis seemed to vaguely see the Martial Emperor's face and quickly avoided it, flying towards Su Yu with a joyful expression, "Did you come to find me, Human Lord?"

Shan Qi and the others were somewhat surprised. It seemed to be Tongtian Marquis?

They hadn't asked about this before, but it turned out Tongtian Marquis had also joined Su Yu.

Su Yu didn't want to waste words with Tongtian Marquis, who talked a lot. He quickly said, "Just now, were there any rule changes on the eighth floor?"

"None!"

Su Yu frowned, and at this moment, the Martial Emperor seemed to realize something, sneering, "Are you worried about extracting too much rule power and causing changes in the Myriad Realms? Opening that so-called Upper Realm?"

Su Yu looked at the Martial Emperor, smiling faintly, "The Martial Emperor knows?"

"Naturally!"

"Then the rule power extracted from the Luminous Domain Mansion, is it from the outside world?"

"Of course not, extract it boldly!"

Su Yu frowned. He was just about to go up with Tongtian Marquis to check when the Martial Emperor said softly, "I see you seem eager to enhance your subordinates' strength. Whether you extract power here or outside, extracting rule power is the fastest way to improve! If you extract it outside, your so-called Upper Realm will open soon!"

Su Yu suddenly had a thought, "Could it be that the rule power here... is suppressing the Martial Emperor?"

He looked at the Martial Emperor's face, who seemed to know what he was thinking.

Or rather, it couldn't be hidden from Su Yu, as he had opened the Heaven Gate.

The Martial Emperor said coldly, "Some of the rule power here is indeed part of a self-contained cycle! But rest assured, it's strong, extract it. A little less won't matter, I won't escape that quickly!"

Su Yu cursed inwardly!

No wonder this guy was so enthusiastic, eager for him to extract more.

Because internally, there should also be a large amount of rule power sealing and suppressing the Martial Emperor. As a result, Su Yu's side would extract quite a bit. Last time, when Heavendoom and the others achieved Daofuse... Su Yu thought of something, "So last time, when Heavendoom and the others achieved Daofuse, the Martial Emperor was much more awake because some of the suppressive power was extracted?"

The Martial Emperor laughed coldly.

"So what if it is?"

Su Yu cursed inwardly!

This situation was unbearable.

Extracting outside would open the Upper Realm.

Extracting here would remove much of the power suppressing the Martial Emperor.

On one hand, there were dozens or even hundreds of Daofuse cultivators from the myriad races; on the other, the Martial Emperor might break free... Damn, it's really hard to handle!

Nearby, the guardian who absorbed the rule reward advanced from the seventh stage to the eighth stage.

These guardians lacked only this rule power. They didn't lack comprehension, having reached the seventh or eighth stage 100,000 years ago. Over the past 100,000 years, the only thing missing was this rule power.

Once replenished, Daofuse wouldn't be far off.

However, doing so might indeed allow the Martial Emperor to break free ahead of time!

Suddenly, Su Yu fell into deep thought.

What to do?

Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor laughed heartily. This fellow was finally not so arrogant!

He said coldly, "Rest assured, extracting here is better than outside! If you extract outside, the myriad races' strong ones will descend, and you'll be doomed!"

"Extracting here will only make me a bit more awake. I'm suppressed not just by some rule power! My path is suppressed, my apertures and source apertures are blocked, my Heaven Gate is sealed! Now, extracting some rule power will only make my apertures a bit smoother..."

He even comforted Su Yu, seemingly quite pleased, "Extract it, at worst, my apertures will fully open, my Heaven Gate will open, and my willpower will extend a bit further, but escaping is still a long way off!"

Su Yu furrowed his brows. "If the Martial Emperor has opened his apertures and the Heaven Gate, then he probably won't fall into chaos again, right?"

The Martial Emperor chuckled softly. "What do you think?"

Su Yu understood. Once the Martial Emperor extracted enough power, he would completely eliminate the previous chaotic crises. No matter how provoked or angry he became, he wouldn't experience the same mental disarray as before. At that point, the Luminous Domain Mansion might no longer be accessible, because the Martial Emperor could act freely within it. And his first action would likely be to eliminate Su Yu.

Without a word, Su Yu activated the Heaven Gate, scanning the surroundings, especially focusing on the apertures of the Martial Emperor. He quickly traversed the space, examining various locations, and after a while, he returned, seemingly having grasped something.

The Martial Emperor's large face followed Su Yu, a smile playing on his lips. "What did you see?"

"I saw 360 apertures. It seems the Martial Emperor has already unlocked a third of the seals," Su Yu said gravely. "It appears that over the years, the Martial Emperor might have had moments of clarity, unlocking some apertures each time."

The Martial Emperor laughed. "So what if that's true? Su Yu, do you have any other choice?"

"If these people don't improve, you can't compete with the myriad races. If they do improve, you won't dare to extract the power of laws from the outside world anymore. In the end, it seems you only have one choice."

The Martial Emperor's voice was soft and mocking. "Make it easier for me. After all, I will eventually break free."

He had Su Yu cornered. There was no second option. If Su Yu had the ability, he could go out and kill these undead. The Death Realm wouldn't reward him, and the outside world would, but then he'd have to wait for the Upper Realm to open.

Su Yu took a deep breath. Yes, it seemed he had no other choice. Without further ado, he shouted, "Continue the slaughter!"

The guards continued their killing spree. Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor's face grew clearer as the undead were slain and the rule rewards descended. The giant pillars made of hair and some petrified columns shattered, revealing the hair within, shrinking significantly from before.

The Martial Emperor's smile grew more radiant, his face more distinct, even revealing a neck. His head floated beside Su Yu, watching the guards kill the undead, and he chuckled softly, "You're killing too few. Kill more! This little bit isn't enough to reach the Daofuse level!"

Su Yu calmly asked, "How many do we need to kill for the Martial Emperor to completely lift the non-Dao seals?"

The Martial Emperor was sealed with more than one seal. Clearly, the sealing back then was formidable; otherwise, he wouldn't have been in a stupor for so many years.

The Martial Emperor laughed. "It's still early! But it should be enough to let some people advance to Daofuse."

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was in a much better mood than before. He chuckled lightly, "You've fused with the pen dao?"

"Yes."

"Not bad."

The Martial Emperor's voice was soft. "You didn't fuse it to deal with me, did you?"

"You're overthinking it, Martial Emperor."

"Am I?"

The Martial Emperor chuckled lightly. "No worries, I'll wait for you! Without mastering the pen dao, you might find it hard to deal with me! If you truly master it, the pen dao's strength might even surpass mine! Actually... it's all the same result, isn't it?"

Su Yu frowned. There was some truth to that. However, with the Saint Transformation Seal, he might not necessarily need to master the pen dao to deal with the Martial Emperor. A higher degree of fusion might also give him hope against the Martial Emperor.

Su Yu pondered and suddenly asked, "Why didn't they kill you back then? The Martial King and the others should have known you harbored resentment against them. You're so powerful; releasing you might not be good for the Human Race."

The Martial Emperor chuckled. "Su Yu, sometimes you're quite naive! Releasing me signifies what? It means the Human Race has declined! It means I can no longer be controlled, and this Human Race might not even have a Lord of Rules anymore! In that case... such a Human Race might already be destroyed or on the verge of destruction. If I come out... perhaps I can leave behind some sparks."

"I... am still part of the Human Race! Killing ninety percent of the Human Race, leaving behind ten percent untainted by Taishan and the others, rebuilding a new Human Race, and exterminating the myriad races' powerful enemies... isn't that a form of legacy?"

He laughed heartily. "You don't understand! Taishan and the others do! My existence isn't to help people like you. They know I oppose you, but... I might not necessarily want to wipe out the Human Race entirely. There are always opportunities, aren't there?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. Perhaps. Maybe that was the intention of the Culture King and the Martial King. If the Martial Emperor emerged and the Human Race couldn't compete, they might be on the brink of extinction. In that case, even if the Martial Emperor destroyed all their legacies, as part of the Human Race, he might preserve a portion and rebuild a new Human Race. Is that considered a legacy? Perhaps it is. The flame of legacy hasn't been extinguished. The Martial King and the others might have been thinking about racial legacy, which might not align with Su Yu's thoughts.

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was much clearer, with more thoughts than before. He saw through Taishan and the others' intentions and didn't mind, laughing, "Su Yu, why not give up? Once I break free, I'll only kill those related to Taishan and the others, preserving most of the Human Race. How about that? I'll handle the myriad races' powerful enemies!"

Su Yu replied calmly, "Can you compete? In the last tidal change, the Hundred Battle King was strong, close to a Lord of Rules, and he still failed. Can you compete with over a hundred Daofuse from the myriad races? Even as a Lord of Rules, can you suppress over a hundred Daofuse alone?"

The Martial Emperor's voice was soft. "It's difficult. A Lord of Rules is formidable, but if they join forces, it's indeed hard to deal with! However, you must understand one thing: alliances can't last forever. Can they always be life-and-death partners, inseparable? Once they separate, with my strength, I can kill three to five Daofuse at a time. After ten or eight times, I'll crush them, and everything will naturally be resolved!"

Yes, if over a hundred Daofuse joined forces, the Martial Emperor would naturally be at a disadvantage! Even if he could kill many! The key is, there's no need. Can so many Daofuse truly join forces for a lifetime without separating? Once separated, with the Martial Emperor's strength, attacking in secret, he could indeed kill one after another!

Su Yu nodded, smiling. "So, I don't need to make any effort. Once the Martial Emperor breaks free, I can just sit back and enjoy the results?"

"Exactly!"

The Martial Emperor laughed, and Su Yu laughed too. "And then... I'll die too? Killed by the Martial Emperor? Along with all the powerful figures of this era, because they all have some ancient legacy! Even cultivators will die because they also have ancient legacies, right?"

The Martial Emperor smiled without answering.

Su Yu also smiled. "Then forget it. I'll handle it myself! The Martial Emperor shouldn't be too complacent. The Martial Emperor is strong, but not necessarily invincible! If that were the case, the Martial King wouldn't have been able to suppress you!"

The Martial Emperor's expression turned slightly unpleasant.

Su Yu continued to smile. "Besides, I'm unifying the Death Realm. There are quite a few Heavenly Kings in the Death Realm. The Martial Emperor can fight Daofuse, but what about five or six Heavenly King-level experts?"

"Last time, the East Heavenly King was killed here. The Martial Emperor saw it too, and they weren't weak!"

The Martial Emperor sneered coldly. "A bunch of riffraff! Though not weak, if you can gather ten, you can naturally come to fight me. If not... they'll all die just the same!"

Ten Heavenly Kings! And they might not even win! Su Yu assessed the Martial Emperor's strength, sighing inwardly. Too strong! And this was after being sealed for countless years! The Martial Emperor might not have even told the whole truth.

Su Yu said no more, and the Martial Emperor also fell silent. His body gradually became clearer. As more undead monarchs were killed, the guards' strength also increased. Gradually, the undead were all slain!

Of the 27 guards, there were originally 6 at the ninth stage, 14 at the eighth stage, and 7 at the seventh stage. Initially, the seventh-stage guards were experimenting, but later, it was the eighth-stage guards killing the undead. After all the captured undead were slain, only 9 guards advanced to the ninth stage. Thus, there were 15 at the Eternal ninth stage, 6 at the eighth stage, and 6 at the seventh stage.

To elevate the rest to the ninth stage, they needed at least forty to fifty more monarch-level experts. Capturing them was difficult. Not to mention Daofuse! For Daofuse, each would need to kill a marquis-level expert.

Su Yu sighed. Truly difficult! He had quite a few monarchs under his command, and many had come, but Su Yu didn't bother them. Killing these monarchs could also lead to advancement, but they were his subordinates. Even if not entirely loyal, Su Yu didn't want to kill his own people to benefit the guards.

"Continue capturing!" Su Yu said in a deep voice. "Capture dozens more monarchs..."

With that, Su Yu thought of something. "I'll release the aura of life to lure some monarchs out, gathering them!"

No matter what, he needed to quickly elevate these guards to the ninth stage. As for the Martial Emperor, he couldn't be bothered with him!

...

Soon, Su Yu teleported away. With Hetu and the guards, he continued along the Celestial River of Death. Su Yu actively lifted the death energy barrier, exposing his life energy. Indeed, with this, some newly awakened powerful undead in the Celestial River of Death actively approached him.

The wisdom of undead marquises was not low, but undead monarchs were not as intelligent.

...

Meanwhile, deep within the Celestial River of Death, formidable beings cautiously traversed the riverbed, gradually approaching a palace made of bones. Within the grand hall, an extremely powerful undead aura resided. At this moment, some intelligent beings gathered around. Those who awakened with wisdom generally possessed Daofuse-level combat strength.

At this moment, a cold, dry voice, as if it hadn't spoken for many years, asked, "Who is this presence? Summoning us, what does it intend?"

"I am Cangshan Ming. I wonder... does anyone still remember me..."

Upon hearing this, some undead fell into contemplation. After a long while, an ancient presence spoke softly, "Cangshan Ming, the former master of the Cangshan of the Nether Clan... the one slain by the Human Race's Battle King?"

In the grand hall, Cangshan Ming spoke with a detached air, "It's me."

"You've actually revived..." The one who recognized him was somewhat surprised. "Before your fall, you were nearly at the power of laws. Now that you've revived, how much of your strength have you retained?"

"Do you want to find out?"

"Heh... I'm not afraid of you." Though he said that, there was a hint of caution. Fear? Not really. After all, he had already died once. What was there to fear from someone who had just revived?

"Cangshan Ming, why have you summoned us?"

"Beyond the Celestial River, have you felt it? A large number of our people are being slaughtered..."

"That has nothing to do with us!"

"Do you wish to remain in this river forever?"

"Why not? It's quite peaceful here."

"......"

A group of undead began to converse. In the Celestial River of Death, some peerless experts were beginning to revive! Some had revived long ago but were too lazy to leave, while others had just recently awakened.

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was capturing more monarchs. The "Calamity" character in his divine script flickered slightly, and he immediately concealed all traces of his life force, casting a glance toward the Celestial River of Death with a slight frown.

The recent commotion had been too great. He had captured a large number of monarchs. Would this cause an uprising? This river was buried with too many powerful beings and geniuses! The aura of life might stimulate their revival, and perhaps many powerful beings had already awakened.

He looked back at the dozens of monarchs he had captured and took a deep breath. It was time to stop for now and retreat. This should be enough!

"Let's go to the Luminous Domain Mansion and continue to improve!"

Su Yu didn't say much more. First, he needed to take down the Northern King's residence! The beings within the Celestial River of Death... might not be a bad thing. If their strength was average and no Heavenly Kings appeared, even if some undead marquises emerged, they would just be delivering themselves to Su Yu. He hoped some undead marquises would come out.

Otherwise, he was really worried there wouldn't be enough for the wardens to advance!

The undead marquises under the Northern King were not enough, and if they were killed in the Death Realm, it wouldn't be of much use. It would be best to capture them alive, though capturing them alive was extremely difficult. With 14 undead marquises, Su Yu thought that even if everything went smoothly, capturing five or six would be incredibly lucky!

Even if one guaranteed the advancement of one warden, it would only ensure the advancement of five or six wardens.

"I still need many undead marquises, but... they can't all come out at once, or that would be troublesome!"

Soon, Su Yu led the wardens into the Luminous Domain Mansion for the second time. The Martial Emperor appeared again, but Su Yu completely ignored him!

At this time, the Martial Emperor wouldn't cause trouble. He was eager for Su Yu to kill more, to help him consume the sealing power.

...

The undead were continuously being slain. The wardens were also advancing one after another. By the time the Martial Emperor's legs were almost free, all 27 wardens had advanced!

And the Martial Emperor wore a bright smile! Though he was just a shadow, even his shadow's legs were emerging, indicating that much of his true self had been unsealed.

He enjoyed this! He loved seeing Su Yu's anger, knowing there was nothing he could do about it. He eagerly anticipated Su Yu bringing more undead to be slain.

As Su Yu was about to leave, he suddenly asked with a hint of curiosity, "Martial Emperor, with flowers planted on your rear and a necromancer's passage opened, I'm curious whether you're male or female. If you're male... is your 'thing' turned into a council chamber? Or the Human Emperor's Palace? Tsk tsk, that's truly disgusting, terrifying!"

Su Yu instantly teleported away with his people!

The Martial Emperor was momentarily stunned, and then, in a fit of rage, he roared, "Su Yu, when I get out, you'll be the first I kill!"

Bastard! This was too much!

"Taishan, I must kill you!"

The Martial Emperor was on the verge of madness! His anger was boundless!

Meanwhile, Tongtian Marquis had already fled, terrified. The Martial Emperor was about to go berserk again. Su Yu had been silent, waiting for the last moment to deliver a fatal blow! Who could endure that?

Tongtian Marquis quickly escaped to the eighth level; it was impossible to stay below. He actually wanted to tell Su Yu that it wasn't what he thought, but after considering it, he decided against it. The Human Lord held grudges too deeply.
