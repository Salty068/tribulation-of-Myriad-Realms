Chapter 677: Awakening and Advancement

The encirclement of the North Heavenly King's Residence continued.

Su Yu merely continued to provoke the other party with words, not truly charging in, which gradually put the powerhouses of the North Heavenly King's Residence somewhat at ease.

Good!

It seemed this new Human Lord was temporarily unable to do anything to the North Heavenly King. The so-called stripping of the kingship had not succeeded, which reassured everyone somewhat.

Su Yu remained for a while longer, then indifferently said, "North Heavenly King, I'm going to the Shengling Realm to play above your head. Leave the North Heavenly King's Residence as soon as possible, or else a few feet might appear above you at any moment!"

With that, Su Yu vanished.

...

Inside the North Heavenly King's Residence.

The North Heavenly King frowned.

Su Yu had left, but even as he left, that fellow had threatened him. Had he truly gone to the sky above his head?

Among the fourteen Death Spirit Marquises, a Devil Race Death Spirit Marquis couldn't hold back any longer and said in a low voice, "Heavenly King, he might have gone to get reinforcements. Why don't we take advantage of his departure to break out? At worst, we can hide in the Celestial River of Death..."

They weren't even planning to win!

Although it seemed they were not inferior to the other side, both having a Heavenly King-level powerhouse and over a dozen Death Spirit Marquises.
