Chapter 820: Kill and Escape! (Ten Thousand Words for Subscription)

Su Yu wanted to say, "I'm not your son." But at this moment, he couldn't say it. The words from the South Heavenly King were impossible to respond to. If he responded, wouldn't that mean he was acknowledging it? If he didn't respond, no one would know who the South Heavenly King was calling. That's the logic!

Yes!

So at this moment, Su Yu simply ignored it. Responding would only make things worse. The South Heavenly King and the others couldn't care less about such details. The South Heavenly King had blurted it out without much thought, and at this moment, she was very excited. Su Yu was indeed reliable!

Under the backlash of the power of laws, Changqing and Changmei were instantly severely injured! In the blink of an eye, the South Heavenly King and several others roared, heavily injuring the two and dragging them with the power of laws toward Su Yu's world!

As for the other Daofuse cultivators, who cared about them? If they dared to come, they would be killed!

Changqing and Changmei's expressions changed drastically, unable to maintain their composure any longer! People would die!

...

Meanwhile, Hundred Battle had been staring at Su Yu. On the side of the Myriad Races, although there were five rulers of laws, they still didn't dare to resist. At this moment, they were rapidly flying toward Yuwang and Yue Zhan!

Over there, the Demon Race's Mo Heavenly Venerable also vaguely showed signs of advancing, but he was surrounded by Marquis Tongtian, leaving him no time to advance.

Yuwang was also anxious at this moment! He roared, "Hundred Battle!"

Hundred Battle had said he wanted to kill Su Yu, but he hadn't made a move. Even when Su Yu unsealed the various sides, he remained inactive.

What was Hundred Battle waiting for?

If this continued, even if more powerful beings emerged from the Gate of Hell, they would be killed by Su Yu and his allies. At this moment, the Gate of Hell couldn't produce too many powerful beings at once. This piecemeal tactic might lead to their annihilation today!

...

Hundred Battle exhaled lightly. He looked at Su Yu and said calmly, "Su Yu, let's end this here."

Su Yu also looked at him, smiling, "Are you trying to say you have a trump card but don't want to use it against me because it would be a waste?"

Su Yu laughed, "You seem hesitant, not too desperate. Is it because this trump card is powerful, but using it on me would be a pity?"

Hundred Battle frowned at him.

Su Yu continued to smile, "Let me guess? Could it be... the Human Ancestor left some trump card, like secret guards, descendants, or some hidden ace... something very powerful? Is that it?"

Hundred Battle's breath became unstable as he looked heavily at Su Yu.

Su Yu went on, "You, Hundred Battle, have high standards. According to my previous speculation, this Zhou Ji might have a very strong Human Ancestor bloodline! If so, you, Hundred Battle, are just like that... Could it be Zhou Ji's mother?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Is his mother very powerful? Is she a strong expert? Is she your trump card? Was she sealed? Is she also a ruler of laws and can now be unsealed?"

"......"

Su Yu felt like he was cursing someone! In fact, he was indeed cursing someone! He was mocking Hundred Battle!

"Why do you always pin your hopes on others?"

Su Yu laughed, "Hundred Battle, I'm increasingly disappointed in you! According to what they said back then, I had high hopes for you. Although you're not very bright, you're strong and daring. Why are you now so timid, always hoping for others to save you instead of you saving others?"

Hundred Battle hadn't made a move, probably because after his previous encounter with Su Yu, he hadn't been able to take him down. And after Su Yu unsealed his world, he became even stronger, leaving Hundred Battle unsure of dealing with him. So, he was waiting!

Su Yu laughed, "Are you happy that I unsealed everyone? Is it because your giant wife couldn't exert the power of a ruler of laws before, but now she can? Because I lifted the seal, you've been waiting for your wife to come over?"

That must be the guess!

Before this, those with the power of a ruler of laws were sealed! And was Hundred Battle's partner strong? Certainly not weak! Hundred Battle had high standards!

Hundred Battle looked deeply at Su Yu and said softly, "Su Yu, since you're so smart, why don't you guess if you can win?"

"Guess?"

Su Yu laughed, "Why guess? If your wife doesn't come, I'll kill Changqing and Changmei. With two fewer rulers of laws, you'll be in trouble, won't you?"

Su Yu finished speaking, coldly saying, "South Heavenly King, be careful not to let Hundred Battle's giant wife ambush you. Everyone, be cautious!"

With that, boom!

A loud noise echoed!

Out of nowhere, a giant appeared in the sky.

Hundred Battle's eyes flickered!

The giant, at this moment, was valiant and cold-faced. As soon as she appeared, she wielded a long spear and repelled the South Heavenly King, instantly appearing beside Changqing and Changmei.

At this moment, both were heavily injured, and in their panic, Changmei hurriedly greeted, "Holy Mother!"

"Useless!"

The woman snorted coldly and looked at Hundred Battle, frowning slightly. She said nothing, then looked at Su Yu, her cold face showing a hint of emotion, "Su Yu, I know you! Let's end this battle here! You can destroy the Myriad Races, but we need the Prison King lineage!"

Su Yu sighed, "It really is a case of fighting the man and then the woman, fighting Hundred Battle, first the son, then the wife. When did Hundred Battle become a man who lives off a woman?"

Opposite, Hundred Battle's face changed slightly.

Su Yu looked at the woman and smiled, "You should thank me for being able to exert this power. You were suppressed and sealed before, right?"

The woman didn't deny it, nodding slightly, "Before the Human Emperor left, he sealed the paths of the Myriad Realms. To avoid being discovered by him, I didn't dare to leave any trump cards, waiting until today!"

Su Yu laughed, "Then shouldn't you thank me? To show your gratitude, why not kill Hundred Battle? How about it?"

Su Yu laughed, "You kill Hundred Battle, kill Changqing, Changmei, and Yue Luo, and I'll agree to leave you alone. How about that?"

"Aren't you afraid of me?"

The woman stepped forward, shattering the void with each step. The South Heavenly King's face turned grim, and she lashed out with a whip, but the woman caught it with her hand, crushing it with a squeeze!

She looked at the South Heavenly King indifferently, "Yu Ziqi, I'm not like these useless ones. You can deal with them, but you're far from dealing with me!"

Her strength was formidable!

She seemed to be physically powerful!

Just like Hundred Battle, at this moment, 720 acupoints in her body were radiating light, seemingly even stronger than Hundred Battle.

If Hundred Battle was considered a strong fourth-tier or weak third-tier, this woman, in Su Yu's estimation, was probably at the level of the Martial Emperor!

And the South Heavenly King, even with Su Yu's enhancement of the power of the world, was probably only at the weak fourth-tier level.

The gap between the two sides was significant!

The South Heavenly King's face was not looking good. She had failed her mission. Su Yu had tasked her with dealing with Changqing and Changmei, but she hadn't succeeded. She was almost ambushed by this woman earlier!

The woman's appearance made even the distant Thunderstorm change color slightly. The next moment, Thunderstorm suddenly struck Red Moon and quickly flew toward her, saying in a low voice, "Thunderstorm greets the Holy Mother!"

The woman nodded slightly, saying nothing.

Hundred Battle was silent for a moment before speaking, "Kill Su Yu, and everything will end naturally!"

He was indeed waiting!

Now, he had waited long enough.

The woman ignored him and looked at Su Yu again, saying calmly, "Do you think you can win against me?"

Su Yu laughed, "Probably difficult!"

The woman nodded and continued walking toward Su Yu, saying loudly, "Come over, gather together. I also want to see if Su Renhuang is prepared to kill us all?"

At this time, whether it was Yue Luo, Yue Zhan, or even Yuwang, they all forced their opponents back and tried to converge toward her.

Only at this moment did this group of powerful beings gain some confidence.

She had appeared!

Over there, the Great Zhou King also looked slightly grim and suddenly spoke, "Are you Yu?"

The woman suddenly looked at the Great Zhou King, frowning slightly, and nodded lightly, "You know me?"

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath, "I know a bit! Back then, when Hundred Battle met you... I knew a bit, but I didn't expect that you were also in a sealed state at that time!"

The woman nodded, "Although I was sealed, I could still move around! What you know should have been told to you by Bingku and the others, right?"

The Great Zhou King said coldly, "You can't escape responsibility for Bingku and their deaths!"

"Yes!"

Yu didn't explain anything, nor did she need to. She said calmly, "Hundred Battle is a descendant of the Human Ancestor. Why should he serve the Human Emperor? Isn't this normal?"

She was also a descendant of the Human Ancestor!

Of course, there were many descendants of the Human Ancestor. For example, those with the surname Zhou, if traced back, might all be descendants of the Human Ancestor, passed down through countless generations. The Human Ancestor wasn't a bachelor.

Her union with Hundred Battle wasn't much, having long surpassed the boundaries.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was rarely angry, saying coldly, "Even if Hundred Battle doesn't want to contribute to the Human Emperor, everything he has was left by the Human Emperor. He must return it! He took everything the Human Emperor left for the Human Race and used it against the Human Race... Hundred Battle deserves to die, and so do you!"

Yu smiled, "Then do you think Su Yu won't do the same?"

She looked at Su Yu and smiled, "Su Yu, if you're willing to stop here, whatever you want, you shall have! What the Human Ancestor can give you, the Human Emperor cannot!"

Su Yu fell into thought, and after a while, he spoke, "Really?"

"Of course!"

"How about you kill yourself first as a demonstration?"

Su Yu said playfully, "Want to try?"

Yu was not angry, merely furrowing her brows slightly. "Bringing back the Human Emperor, what can that change? What can it give you? Perhaps all it will bring is disaster!"

Around her, more powerful figures gathered. Thunderstorm approached swiftly, and over there, Yue Luo and the others were also closing in on her. On Su Yu's side, Hundred Battle had his aura locked onto Su Yu, preventing him from intervening.

Su Yu chuckled and looked at the Great Zhou King. "You know her? Do you have a way to deal with her?"

The Great Zhou King had hidden many things. Was it all to deal with this woman? What other cards did he have up his sleeve?

The Great Zhou King's expression shifted slightly. After a moment, he spoke in a low voice, "No... The Martial Emperor was the backup plan against her! When the Martial Emperor was unsealed, Your Majesty saw a layer of the Human Emperor's seal. Actually... that was the basis of my negotiation with the Martial Emperor... but..."

There was no result!

The Martial Emperor's seal had been casually broken by Su Yu. 

Su Yu couldn't help but curse, "So, you really did hide things from me. You could unseal the Martial Emperor, couldn't you?"

The Great Zhou King replied in a low voice, "I couldn't. I also needed to seize the right moment... According to my calculations, the Martial Emperor and the others would be unsealed together with this woman! At that time, she would be unsealed, but the Martial Emperor wouldn't be able to act. He would be desperate, and if I helped him break the Human Emperor's seal, he would likely help me deal with her!"

The Great Zhou King continued in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, do not underestimate this woman. The changes in Hundred Battle are all related to her! She should be the one responsible for bringing back the Human Ancestor!"

In the era of the Human Ancestor, there was no Hundred Battle. But this Yu might be the direct descendant of the Human Ancestor's lineage. The Great Zhou King, in the previous tide, might have also glimpsed her existence, realizing he was no match and could only find ways to delay and wait for an opportunity.

Su Yu sighed, "It's really complicated! Great Zhou King, you knew of her existence, why didn't you tell me?"

The Great Zhou King hesitated... I didn't know you would unseal everyone so quickly.

Su Yu sighed, "You always say half and hide half. You're really not honest! You're quite annoying, you know?"

The Great Zhou King hesitated for a moment but still said, "She... didn't feel this strong before..."

Moreover, after the Martial Emperor was unsealed, he felt a bit more confident. Who would have thought Su Yu would let the Martial Emperor go so easily?

Opposite, Yu smiled, "Su Yu, as I said, there's no need to fight to the death. Why not just stop here?"

"What I've done has nothing to do with you, does it?"

Yu smiled faintly, "If you want to save the Human Emperor, you can go yourself. If you want to be your emperor, you can. I won't stop you! I can even confer a title upon you..."

"Wait!"

Su Yu interrupted, "What? You want to confer a title on me?"

"The Human Ancestor's lineage, don't they have the qualification?"

Yu chuckled, "The Human Ancestor is the foundation of the human race's growth! Su Yu, you must understand this! This is not something the ancient royal court can represent!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "Impressive! Even more powerful than the ancient royal court... Then why not fight the Human Emperor? Why pretend with me?"

Su Yu laughed as he inhaled, "You people, hiding in the shadows like rats, always trying to turn the tide. Last time, there was a Marquis Ziyun like that... and then... oh, she was killed by me in an instant, what a pity!"

Yu's smile gradually faded, "Do you think you can kill me too?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "There's hope!"

She laughed, "Do you think you're stronger than the Martial Emperor?"

"Not really, at best about the same, still within my world!"

Su Yu shrugged, "If I could kill the Martial Emperor, I would have done it already!"

"Then you..."

Su Yu didn't wait for her to continue and laughed, "You, at best, are about the same as the Martial Emperor, slightly stronger than third-class, slightly weaker than second-class, right?"

"And Hundred Battle, slightly stronger than fourth-class, slightly weaker than third-class!"

Su Yu chuckled, "You're all quite formidable! Honestly, it's not easy to fight!"

"But, this era, it bears the surname Su! Su Yu's Su!"

Su Yu rambled, "Everyone thinks my combat strength is average, not suited for fighting, only capable of playing tricks. In reality, that's not true. My strongest aspect... is actually combat strength!"

"Don't laugh!"

Su Yu laughed, "Why are you all laughing? My greatest skill is killing! I have many methods!"

"You two, today, I really want to weigh your abilities!"

Su Yu smiled, "Let's get started! Why are you all standing there?"

As Su Yu spoke, in the next moment, some of the strong ones remaining in his world suddenly began to draw upon the great Dao.

In that instant, Wan Tiansheng drew upon the Human Dao, Lantian drew upon the Dao of All Beings, March drew upon the Body Forging Dao, Doubao drew upon the Illusory Dao...

These Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables, who hadn't advanced to the ruler of laws, at this moment, all drew upon the power of all the great Daos!

In an instant, a surge of powerful power of laws broke in Su Yu's world, merging into Su Yu's world.

Even those like the Fate Emperor also merged into it.

Su Yu's world rapidly expanded, in the blink of an eye, radiating outwards, encroaching upon the heavens near Ren Mountain, spreading towards Yu!

Su Yu murmured, "Can you feel it? I'm plucking the wool of the Lord of Time, plucking it madly... I hope he won't come back to deal with me... otherwise, I'm doomed!"

Yu's expression changed slightly, and Hundred Battle also stopped waiting, letting out a low roar, punching towards Su Yu!

Over there, Yu also flew swiftly towards Su Yu!

However, halfway there, Destiny, South King, Giant Axe, Undead Emperor, Great Zhou King, Red Moon, and Blood Shadow, these powerful figures, all flew over!

On the side of the myriad races, Tiangu's expression changed slightly. In the next moment, he shouted, "Stop Yu Qing and Yue Zhan! Emperor Yu, what you said before... does it still count?"

"It does!"

Su Yu laughed, "You, Tiangu, are still so wise at this moment. Although I want to kill you... it still counts! Killing you, I'm not in a hurry! You five, take down Yu Qing and Yue Zhan, and it's done! The others, you don't need to intervene! If you do, I won't be at ease!"

Tiangu no longer hesitated, and the five powerful figures instantly appeared in front of Yu Qing and Yue Zhan.

At this moment, Mo Heavenly Venerable, without the entanglement of Marquis Tongtian, also had his aura fluctuating, actually advancing!

Five against three!

Yu Qing and the others' expressions changed, Mo Heavenly Venerable furrowed his brows slightly, "Tiangu... now is different from before..."

Tiangu ignored him!

Nothing has changed, it's still the same.

Su Yu... will win.

Intuition!

Su Yu licked his lips, dodging Hundred Battle's attack, and laughed, "Not enough, not enough! I feel I'm still not strong enough! I haven't plucked enough wool! I want to gather great power in one body! Everyone... do you understand?"

Hundred Battle's expression changed slightly. In the next moment, he couldn't help but shout angrily, "Are you all crazy? You believe him too? Once you merge, you'll become his vassals..."

Before he finished speaking, Su Yu's world spread.

At this moment, Yu and the others were already covered.

Giant Axe was still bewildered, while Destiny Marquis smiled bitterly, "Your Majesty... we just advanced..."

As he spoke, the Destiny Dao broke with a rumble!

In the next moment, a powerful force of laws swept in, instantly connecting with the Destiny Dao in Su Yu's great Dao!

Hongmeng also grinned, not having enjoyed it yet!

Really... not giving us a moment of satisfaction!

In the blink of an eye, the Divine Mountain Dao broke, merging into Su Yu's world.

Giant Axe was still a bit dazed, but quickly understood, "You want us to break our Dao and merge, right?"

It's so complicated, I almost didn't understand.

Damn!

Alright, I get it now!

In an instant, Giant Axe's great Dao broke, and in the blink of an eye, it also merged into Su Yu's world.

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly. At this moment, he could only pin his hopes on Su Yu. In an instant, the Dao of Endurance broke, extracting a large amount of power of laws, merging into Su Yu's world!

These rulers of laws, at this moment, actually chose to break their powerful ruler of laws' power because of a single word from Su Yu!

Su Yu's world seemed not yet so perfect.

Merging into Su Yu's great Dao was still slightly weaker than the ruler of laws.

And among the crowd, Red Moon and Blood Shadow exchanged glances, feeling a bit uneasy and horrified.

These newly advanced rulers of laws, without any hesitation, broke their Dao and merged into Su Yu's world. Were they not afraid that if Su Yu died, they would all die too?

Yu's expression also changed, no longer as calm as before, and she said in a low voice, "You must know, his world has just been born... far less stable than the River of Time and the Death Path! By doing this... you're placing all your hopes on him. If he dies, you'll all die!"

Are they crazy?

A group of rulers of laws, even in the Human Emperor's era, it wasn't so easy to make a ruler of laws break their Dao!

On Su Yu's side, these few, having just advanced, hadn't even experienced the power of a ruler of laws, and they directly broke their Dao!

This... what kind of trust is this!

Moreover, Su Yu's world is not perfect. Even if all these people merge into Su Yu's world, as Su Yu's world grows, they will find it difficult to surpass their previous strength in a short time!

Red Moon and Blood Shadow were also hesitating at this moment!

They were worried!

Worried that if everyone merged, and the rulers of laws were gone, then if Su Yu was in danger, what... what would they do?

They couldn't match these people!

They were all rulers of laws, still able to fight. They didn't quite understand why these people would trust Su Yu so much, although they also knew Su Yu was not an ordinary person.

But since Su Yu opened his world, he had rarely made a move. Even when he did, he hadn't gone all out.

At this time, except for a few, they all merged into Su Yu's world.

The Undead Emperor didn't merge, his Death Path was difficult to handle, and breaking it might kill him.

Tongtian didn't merge, Su Yu didn't let him.

The Tea Plant didn't merge, she walked the Chaos Path, merging would be useless.

The rest, almost all merged into Su Yu's world.

Some couldn't find a suitable Dao, so they simply found a random Dao to merge with.

As for the others, including Fat Ball, they all fused their Daos. Fat Ball was quite reluctant, but... it believed that Su Yu could become incredibly powerful!

At this moment, the faces of the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger were pale. Even these ancient chaotic beasts were somewhat frightened.

Just like that... they fused their Daos?

"The heavens split into two layers!"

Su Yu chuckled, and in an instant, the heavens were divided!

Two layers of heaven!

Apart from Su Yu and Hundred Battle, the others, including the Great Zhou King, fell into the other layer of heaven!

Seeing Red Moon and Blood Shadow hesitating, the Great Zhou King transmitted his voice, "This is your chance... your last chance... Otherwise, even if you acted before, His Majesty will not accept you. At this moment... fusing your Dao is your only hope!"

Red Moon and Blood Shadow exchanged glances. They were rulers of laws, beings of the Human King level in ancient times. After countless years of cultivation, becoming rulers of laws was incredibly difficult!

At this moment... should they fuse their Daos?

As the two were contemplating, suddenly, a half-body flew towards them. In an instant, a great Dao shattered and directly merged into the heavens, randomly finding a Dao to instantly fuse into.

Wu Ji, without a word, quickly sat down cross-legged, exclaiming in terror, "Damn, I almost died. Luckily, I can fuse my Dao!"

"......"

Red Moon and the others stared at him in a daze. Wu Ji... didn't die?

His great Dao almost completely collapsed!

His fusion of the Dao seemed somewhat... perfunctory.

Because his great Dao was about to break!

Wasn't this taking a shortcut?

Seeing them looking at him, Wu Ji grinned foolishly, "Everyone wants to beat Hundred Battle. Even though I'm heavily injured, I'm willing to contribute to Emperor Yu!"

The Great Zhou King and others instantly looked at him, not appearing like a good person!

This guy, at this moment, fused his Dao to save his life!

Not to enhance Su Yu's strength!

Of course, a nearly broken Dao still contained a large amount of the power of laws, which was still useful.

Red Moon and Blood Shadow struggled immensely at this moment. They lacked understanding of Su Yu, but at this moment, they had no choice. Gritting their teeth, they severed their great Daos!

Seeing this, Hundred Battle shouted angrily, "Do you understand him? Are you severing your Daos for him?"

Red Moon gritted her teeth, "I don't understand! But you betrayed the Human Race, you betrayed us! Back then, we trusted you, followed you, believed you could lead us to defeat the myriad races, to defeat the Sin Race! You were our faith, our hero!"

"But now... Hundred Battle, you are a traitor. To kill you, this traitor, even if it means death and the destruction of our Daos, we are willing!"

Red Moon didn't understand Su Yu!

It didn't matter. At this moment, her hatred for Hundred Battle surpassed everything. If Su Yu could kill him, everything would be worth it. Red Moon gritted her teeth and said, "Your Majesty Emperor Yu, kill Hundred Battle. As long as you kill him... we have no other requests and will accept any punishment from Emperor Yu!"

They were wrong!

They had been wrong six thousand years ago!

Now, they could only hope that Su Yu could slay Hundred Battle and his followers, or else this hatred would never be resolved!

Hundred Battle, a traitor!

At this moment, Su Yu's aura grew increasingly powerful, shaking the heavens and earth. His world began to radiate outward. Seeing this, Yu shouted, "Withdraw!"

In an instant, they flew outward!

Su Yu's world was expanding, suppressing their strength, while Su Yu grew stronger. Fighting Su Yu here was asking for trouble!

So many rulers of laws, all fusing their Daos into Su Yu's world, was a terrifying thing!

Time, place, and people, all favored Su Yu!

"Leave?"

Su Yu smiled, reaching out to grab, and suddenly, beside Yu, apart from a few rulers of laws, everyone else vanished instantly, unable to resist!

And those few, instantly appeared before Su Yu.

Among them were some familiar faces.

"Are you Jiang Hai? Last time I saved you, and you even followed me for a few days. How can you curse me every day?"

Jiang Hai Marquis's face changed!

Boom!

Su Yu crushed him, his great Dao collapsing, the power of laws dissipating, his body and Dao perishing, instantly merging into Su Yu's world.

At this moment, Su Yu's smile was radiant.

"Wu Shan, you too, how could you do this? I really dislike ungrateful people. I saved you, didn't I?"

Boom!

Wu Shan was crushed by him!

In the distance, Yu and the others quickly fled, trying to escape Su Yu's world!

Su Yu didn't care about them, continuing to call out names, "Shadow, you don't seem to have spoken ill of me..."

Shadow Marquis sighed, "Emperor Yu... forgive me!"

"Did you know Hundred Battle was a traitor?"

"I didn't know."

Shadow Marquis sighed, "I didn't believe he would betray... maybe... it's all Yu's fault..."

Su Yu smiled, "You, stubborn as ever! Still... die!"

Boom!

Shadow Marquis was crushed by him!

In the distance, below, Ying Wu and Marquis Dingjun's expressions changed slightly. Marquis Dingjun wanted to fly out, but his face was extremely complex, and he remained silent.

The next moment, Su Yu reached out and grabbed, pulling a figure into his hand, Yun Shui Marquis!

At this moment, Yun Shui Marquis was injured.

She looked at Su Yu, a self-mocking smile on her face, "No need for Emperor Yu to act..."

Below, General Ying Wu couldn't help but shout, "Your Majesty, she didn't act before, she didn't make a move before..."

Although Yun Shui Marquis had deceived her, in the Upper Realm, General Ying Wu had the best relationship with her, having been friends for many years.

At this moment, seeing Shadow killed and Yun Shui captured, she couldn't hold back!

Just now, during the chaos, Yun Shui Marquis hadn't acted but was injured by the battles of others.

Shadow, she wasn't too familiar with, as Shadow had always been mysterious.

But Yun Shui, she often visited her.

"Originally, I should have given you face, Ying Wu..."

Su Yu smiled, "But... at this time, I can't afford to be soft-hearted, or else everyone will dare to oppose me!"

Boom!

Su Yu's massive hand covered the sky, instantly crushing Yun Shui Marquis.

He wore a smile, but it was a cold smile, "At this moment, better to kill wrongly than to let go! When people die, debts are cleared. If Ying Wu is willing, she can go to the Death Realm to look for them... once dead, debts are cleared!"

Below, Ying Wu remained silent.

And Su Yu, with a palm strike, instantly killed the other seven or eight Daofuse cultivators!

Su Yu smiled, "As for the others, I can't be bothered to ask their names, too troublesome! Nameless nobodies, let them die!"

In the distance, Hundred Battle glanced back at Su Yu, his eyes cold.

Su Yu sneered, "Do you think you can leave? This is my world!"

"Return!"

With a low shout, the next moment, a powerful force of laws swept towards them.

Yu and Hundred Battle instantly struck!

One person, one punch!

Boom!

Those forces of laws were instantly shattered!

"Can't leave!"

"Lock!"

"Trap!"

"Decay!"

"......"

Countless forces of the great Dao swept across the entire world!

However, Hundred Battle and Yu were indeed powerful, striking again, shattering one force of the great Dao after another!

Su Yu's world was not yet perfect!

At this moment, Su Yu also chuckled dryly, "Embarrassing, sorry!"

The people below were helpless!

At this time, do you still care about this?

Quickly stop them!

Su Yu smiled, and at the edge of the world, suddenly a large seal floated, and Su Yu roared!

Hundred Battle and Yu were both startled!

They thought Su Yu was going to suppress them again, but unexpectedly, Su Yu roared and shouted, "I ask the Human Emperor to lend me the power of the great Dao!"

Boom!

The Human Lord Seal spread out, and a surge of human destiny erupted on the Human Lord Seal. The next moment, in the distance, in the source of the Dao, in that half of the Human Emperor's great Dao, a surge of the power of laws trembled!

In the blink of an eye, through the Human Lord Seal, it connected to Su Yu's great Dao!

"Okay!"

The grand voice of the Human Emperor echoed again, this time wanting to add another sentence. The opportunity was rare, and today this grandson kept borrowing his power, he still wanted to say a few words...

As a result, Su Yu roared, suppressing all sounds, the great Dao trembled, instantly shattering that little bit of willpower connection!

The Human Emperor was just a tool, no need to speak.

Today, I am the protagonist!

......

"Damn!"

In the depths of the River of Time, a curse echoed, shaking the four directions, and soon, everything quieted down.

The river trembled!

Could it be that the Martial Emperor died again, and His Majesty was very upset?

Anyway, everyone was used to the river trembling, today it trembled especially violently!

His Majesty also cursed several times!

As for why he cursed?

Who cares!

Maybe he couldn't save face!

The Human Emperor's shadow was extremely angry, Su Yu, right?

This time, I really remember you. I finally managed to channel some willpower over, I just wanted to say a word, and you, this grandson, shattered my willpower in an instant!

Are you even human?

You said you wanted to borrow the power of the great Dao, I lent it!

You said you wanted to borrow the power of the Dao field, I lent it too!

Just short of borrowing my life, is this how you treat me?

The Human Emperor was very angry!

Bastard!

Too much bullying!

Do you think I'm easy to bully?

Or do you think that since I'm not here, you can do whatever you want?

"Forget it, when I return, I'll settle accounts with you properly!"

The Human Emperor thought, Martial Emperor, Su Yu, these two guys, both need to settle accounts!

Return... soon.

If it were too far, in the past, even if Su Yu wanted to borrow, he would be powerless. Now, the distance to the Myriad Realms wasn't too far, he could barely channel some willpower over!

This also meant that soon, this place would merge with the Myriad Realms!

"What exactly is he doing?"

The Human Emperor thought, not quite understanding, but he knew that today, there must be a major change in the Myriad Realms!

......

At this moment, in the Upper Realm, the power of the Human Emperor's great Dao connected with Su Yu's great Dao.

Connected through the Human Lord Seal!

A surge of overwhelming power of laws instantly suppressed the entire world!

And Su Yu also took a deep breath.

Not bad!

A half-abandoned great Dao actually felt no weaker than my world, which has integrated countless rule-based great Daos. It makes me want to say, Human Emperor, lend me your great Dao to merge!

Forget it, don't merge!

If merged, when the Human Emperor returns, he may not be able to continue opening the heavens.

His Dao has only been opened for a short time.

Still impressive!

Su Yu thought to himself, but his face showed a smile. I knew it, the Human Emperor would lend it!

Moreover, he also knew that the Human Emperor wasn't too far from this place, otherwise, he wouldn't be able to borrow it.

This time, my strength should be enough, right?

So many rulers of laws have merged, and with the borrowed power of the Human Emperor's great path, if I can't defeat these people, I'd be letting everyone down!

In an instant, Su Yu vanished from his original spot.

Bai Zhan and Yu's expressions changed as they both struck out, one with a fist and the other with a spear, aiming at the void!

As soon as they attacked, their expressions shifted again.

It wasn't them!

Su Yu wasn't targeting them, but it was too late. Here, their senses were dulled.

Bai Zhan and Yu exchanged a glance and quickly moved away, flying into the distance. They had to leave Su Yu's domain. The pressure from Su Yu's domain had reached its peak!

Just as they left, boom!

With a loud explosion, Su Yu punched through Chang Mei's chest. Already severely injured from backlash, blood continuously flowed from Chang Mei's mouth, carrying a hint of despair. He struggled to speak, "I... was just... serving my master..."

"I know!"

Su Yu nodded, showing understanding. "It's normal. In fact, I need subordinates like you, like the Great Zhou King, who understands people's hearts... cough, I misspoke, I mean capable ministers! So, I don't blame you. You're a loyal subordinate to Bai Zhan and Yu, and I understand you, truly!"

He didn't blame Chang Mei!

Everyone serves their master, and Chang Mei was right. It's just that his master was a bit of a pitfall.

But people like Chang Mei are actually the loyal subjects of Bai Zhan, always thinking from Bai Zhan's perspective. Su Yu didn't think he was wrong.

It's just a matter of different stances!

Chang Mei's long eyebrows twitched slightly, revealing a faint smile. Blood gushed from his mouth, and the power of his great path dissipated, yet he still smiled. "Emperor Yu... magnanimous! My master... actually... wasn't bad before... just... just... experienced too few setbacks..."

"He... he was... intimidated... intimidated by the Holy Mother... My master... if not dead... can still rise..."

Chang Mei coughed blood continuously, the power of the great path dissipating, yet he forced himself to turn his head to look in the direction Bai Zhan was fleeing. In the next moment, he suddenly used all his strength and roared, "Bai Zhan! You were born for battle! Undefeated in a hundred battles! If you don't fight, are you still Bai Zhan? Only by fighting, fighting to the last moment, are you the Hundred Battle King! The Emperor of Hundred Battles!"

Boom!

A loud noise echoed through the heavens and earth, the great path completely shattered, Chang Mei's eyebrows broke, yet he smiled, "I've said my piece, I'm satisfied!"

My master is not inferior to Su Yu!

If he survives this defeat, he will surely return to his former glory!

His body instantly shattered into pieces, swallowed by Su Yu's domain.

Ahead, Bai Zhan, who was fleeing, paused in his steps. Suddenly, memories surfaced in his mind.

"You have outstanding talent, sweeping through your peers undefeated. You will surely have great prospects... I see you undefeated in a hundred battles... If you become the Human Lord, you shall be called the Hundred Battle King!"

"Are you Marquis Chang Mei?"

"Indeed, young man, you have a keen eye! Of course, these eyebrows of mine are too obvious. You're a good seedling... I appreciate you!"

"Lord Marquis Chang Mei, if I become the Human Lord, will you serve me?"

"Hahaha, young one, it's good to have such ambition! If you can truly defeat others and become the ninth generation Human Lord... nine is the ultimate, you will surely be the strongest Human Lord. At that time, I will be your loyal subordinate, Chang Mei!"

Memories surfaced one after another. From that day on, he had one more person by his side, Marquis Chang Mei!

He was my will!

From that day on, Chang Mei served him for seven thousand years, never once defying him, even when... he pledged allegiance to the Human Ancestor!

"I believe in His Majesty, nine is the ultimate, His Majesty will surely be the strongest existence!"

Bai Zhan's mind echoed with these words, filled with some confusion, some shock. I... just ran away!

I didn't go to save Chang Mei!

I didn't save this elder who served me for seven thousand years!

And he... in his dying moment, was still advising me, urging me.

Bai Zhan's cheeks twitched slightly, wanting to cry, but suddenly didn't want to.

Have I... really changed?

Scared out of my wits?

"What are you dawdling for, retreat from this domain quickly!"

Beside him, Yu shouted angrily. At this moment, he was still dawdling!

In Su Yu's domain, coupled with the Human Emperor's domain covering them, their strength was greatly suppressed. Otherwise, with just Su Yu's domain alone, they wouldn't be afraid!

Bai Zhan felt stiff, quickly running towards the edge.

Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at Yu.

In the past, you, who seemed invincible in my eyes, actually... ran away too!

The first time I saw you, I was intimidated. I thought no one in the world was stronger than you, but now... you're just so-so!

You don't even dare to fight Su Yu, who is six thousand years your junior!

At this moment, suddenly, some firm beliefs shattered!

Yu, you're just so-so!

And the Human Ancestor, what about him?

For six thousand years, I believed you could win, believed you were invincible, but it turns out, you're not!

And I, I've been a deserter for six thousand years!

No, I've been a traitor!

Bai Zhan mocked himself in his heart. Chang Mei was dead, those who followed him were all dead, they believed in him, yet he believed in others!

Turns out, I'm really nothing!

Boom!

Another loud noise echoed through the heavens and earth.

"Your Majesty... run!"

Chang Qing's final shout echoed through the heavens and earth, and behind, Su Yu directly tore him apart. In the explosion, Chang Qing shattered completely!

The second ruler of laws slain by Su Yu!

At this moment, Bai Zhan's eyes suddenly turned red. He wanted to turn back and fight, but beside him, Yu shouted angrily, "Run, once we're out of this domain, if he dares to come out, we'll kill him!"

Bai Zhan's mouth twitched, but he said nothing, continuing to flee.

As he fled, he suddenly said, "If you and I join forces, along with Chang Qing and the others, we can fight him!"

Yes, if Yu didn't flee, if they joined forces, even with Su Yu borrowing power, they could fight!

Yu, however, coldly retorted, "Then one of us might die, stop talking nonsense. If they die, we can cultivate more. If you and I die, who will bring the Human Ancestor back?"

Oh!

So, you're worried about this.

Bai Zhan said no more.

At this moment, it's too late to wake up!

Chang Qing and Chang Mei are both dead!

Too late!

He reached out and grabbed Yue Luo, Lei Bao, and Yue Xiao behind him. Yue Luo had been dragging Yue Xiao, and at this moment, this Heavenly Venerable was still alive.

Yu saw this, frowned slightly, but said nothing.

And Yue Luo, with a hint of a smile on his face, quickly turned to despair, transmitting his voice, "Your Majesty, go... I'll hold him off for a moment!"

Bai Zhan stiffly smiled, suddenly transmitting his voice, "Over six thousand years ago, you were Yu's plant by my side, weren't you?"

Yue Luo's face stiffened.

He lowered his head, saying nothing.

Bai Zhan laughed!

I knew it!

And because I knew, I said nothing.

Unfortunately, saying this now is useless.

"When we're out of here, run, run far away!"

Bai Zhan suddenly transmitted to Yue Luo, "Run far, as far as you can, into the endless void, the depths of chaos, wherever you can go... this Myriad Realms has become a slaughterhouse!"

"Your Majesty can win..."

Yue Luo trembled.

"We'll see!"

Bai Zhan said no more, let's see!

But I won't easily admit defeat, just like six thousand years ago, before meeting Yu!
