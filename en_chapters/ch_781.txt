Chapter 781: Su Yu's Foundation (Subscription Requested)

The boots of the Culture King had the power to sever and seal. At this moment, even though the passage opened above the Sealed Grounds, Fat Ball still managed to sever the opponent's passage with a single boot.

Eight supreme experts!

Two Heavenly Sovereigns and six Heavenly Kings.

Such formidable strength was truly terrifying.

However, on Su Yu's side, the battle prowess was equally formidable. Fat Ball, Wan Tiansheng, Lantian, the Great Zhou King, Doubao, Flatbread, Marquis Huoyun, Consort Qi, and Hongmeng were all present.

Yet, a few Heavenly Kings were absent.

The undead were not mentioned, and at this moment, the Fate Emperor led his forces swiftly towards the Dragonblood Marquis. Meanwhile, Jiuyue, the Great Qin King, and the Great Xia King led their forces towards the Celestial River of Death. Over there, a large number of powerful beings were emerging from the Celestial River of Death, flying towards the breach where Su Yu was located. Clearly, they were either influenced by rewards or directly affected in their will.

At this moment, more than ten Heavenly King-level beings were scattering in all directions, leading a large number of Daofuse and Eternal experts, heading in all directions to intercept and kill Su Yu.

...

Sealed Grounds.

Fat Ball instantly turned dark, roaring, "I'll kill these two Heavenly Sovereigns, you take care of the others!"

Fifteen experts, eight chose to enter the Death Path.

Fat Ball intended to single-handedly hold back two Heavenly Sovereigns, leaving the remaining eight Heavenly Kings to fight against the other six Heavenly King-level undead.

However, the situation was unclear.

Among the remaining seven, aside from the Undead Emperor who clearly stated he would not participate, there were still two Heavenly Sovereigns and four Heavenly Kings. Such strength was also terrifying.

Yet, there was no time to worry!

Previously, Su Yu's side was overwhelmingly powerful, but now, the entire Death Realm was opposing Su Yu.

As for the North King, the intentions of the Dragonblood Marquis were unknown.

The North King had yet to make a move, but no one dared to be careless. The Great Ming King and his people were already flying towards the North King to prevent any sudden actions.

Including the powerful beings in the Sealed Grounds, fortunately, the Undead Emperor chose not to act; otherwise, this would have been a catastrophic outcome!

Su Yu had to abandon the idea of resurrecting others!

Of course, if Su Yu were to retreat early, there was still a way out. The power of the Death Path, including that of the undead giant, might not pursue them outside.

Su Yu still had a retreat!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King shouted, "If His Majesty abandons the revival of the South King and the others, must you insist on mutual destruction?"

His roar shook the surroundings!

Upon hearing this, the eight experts ascending paused slightly.

"Kill!"

Boom!

A boot stomped down, intimidation aside, killing was still necessary. Killing a few would deter the others!

Otherwise, today's matter would become a huge problem.

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, a total of seventeen top-tier experts, the weakest being at the Heavenly King level, clashed instantly.

Fat Ball's boot blocked a Heavenly Sovereign, while its true form personally engaged another Heavenly Sovereign. The power of devouring erupted, devouring the heavens and earth, biting fiercely at the Heavenly Sovereign it was fighting against!

Kill these guys!

Among the eight participating experts, someone shouted, "Everyone, we've known each other for years, why not act now? If we don't leave now, when will we? The Emperor's strength is formidable; he can leave at any time. Can we leave at any time?"

"Seize this opportunity! If we can kill Su Yu and become the master of rules, we can dominate a region!"

"Even if we can't kill Su Yu, killing the South King and others will give the Heavenly Sovereigns a chance to become the master of rules, and the Heavenly Kings will surely become Heavenly Sovereigns!"

The eight experts shouted.

The battle erupted instantly.

And just as these people shouted, intending to join forces with others to kill Fat Ball and the others, Lantian suddenly let out a crazed scream, manifesting tens of thousands of clones that exploded instantly!

"You talk too much!"

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed throughout the Death Realm, a mushroom cloud erupted, and Lantian's strongest clone appeared, piercing through a death mark with a single sword, shattering it into powder!

Boom!

The entire Death Realm's rules trembled slightly, and the earth shook!

In the instant of battle, Lantian, with a crazed and reckless approach, almost as if seeking mutual destruction, instantly killed a Heavenly King!

At this moment, the world fell silent for a moment.

The clone of Lantian that killed the Heavenly King was on the verge of collapse, yet it carried an incredibly strong aura, shouting, "Who dares to come up next, I will kill you!"

This sword intimidated everyone!

Too terrifying!

A Heavenly King, an incredibly powerful being, was killed just like that.

Near the fallen Heavenly King, Dizhi Luo's face changed dramatically. Were these people this crazy?

On Lantian's side, eight Heavenly Kings surrounded Dizhi Luo and his five companions. In the blink of an eye, one was dead!

At this moment, it became eight Heavenly Kings surrounding five!

Dizhi Luo's expression changed, and the next moment, he shouted, "Everyone, are you still watching? If we are killed, you won't have a good end. Defying the Lord of the Dead, do you still wish to survive in this Death Realm?"

Below, aside from the Undead Emperor, the six remaining experts also looked serious.

Defying the Lord of the Dead was not a good choice.

If it weren't for the will of the Lord of the Dead, they might not have acted, but at this moment...

Someone looked towards the Undead Emperor, someone transmitted to the Emperor, "Emperor, are you really not going to act? Our source of the Great Dao is within the Death Path, this world belongs to the Lord of the Dead, Emperor!"

This was defying the heavens!

Truly defying the heavens!

The Lord of the Dead was the heavens of this world, even if not fully revived, they couldn't defy it. If the Emperor didn't act, the others were conflicted.

But watching Dizhi Luo and his companions being surrounded and slaughtered by the crazed Wan Tiansheng and others, if this continued, they might all fall!

The Undead Emperor glanced at them, sighing lightly.

Yes, defying the Lord of the Dead was a troublesome matter.

However... the will of the Lord of the Dead had only revived a little, and it might just be some residual will.

And Su Yu's side was truly the strong of the Death Realm.

Over a hundred Daofuse!

At this moment, even if they won, it would be a pyrrhic victory.

"Baru, Yuji, listen to my advice... wait for the seal to break on its own, or wait for Su Yu to actively help us break the seal!"

He was speaking to two Heavenly Sovereign-level beings who hadn't participated in the battle.

As he spoke, suddenly, within the Death Path, an undead once again killed multiple experts, and its aura instantly strengthened, advancing from third class to second class in the blink of an eye.

This strengthening speed was too fast!

Not only that!

At this moment, the Death Path fluctuated, and the source power left behind by the Heavenly King previously killed by Lantian was instantly absorbed by that second-class Daofuse.

At this moment, the undead giant's voice resonated through the heavens and earth, "Those who follow my orders shall be rewarded!"

Yes, this will directly awarded the source power of the recently deceased Heavenly King to the undead who had just killed some experts.

In the past, when a Heavenly King fell, the source power would dissipate and be absorbed by others, thus strengthening them. This was the process in the Death Realm where the fall of other strong beings would continuously give rise to stronger ones.

The source power would dissipate and be divided among others!

In this way, these powers still belonged to the Death Path!

With this move, the six experts who hadn't participated in the battle on the Undead Emperor's side instantly became envious!

Not only could they escape, but now they saw the hope of advancing!

From Heavenly Sovereign to master of rules, from Heavenly King to Heavenly Sovereign!

At this moment, it seemed so simple, right before their eyes!

The six experts were all eager to move.

Above, Fat Ball was fighting two alone, being pushed back step by step. However, on Wan Tiansheng's side, leading a group of strong beings, they suppressed the five Heavenly Kings on the other side. But if this continued, Wan Tiansheng felt that the few below would join the battle!

Once they joined, with two more Heavenly Sovereigns and four more Heavenly Kings, it would be troublesome.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng thought of Marquis Tongtian.

Outside, there were still March and a Heavenly Sovereign present.

If these two entered, they could resist the two Heavenly Sovereigns who hadn't yet joined the battle. As for the four Heavenly Kings, joining in would make it nine Heavenly Kings against eight; they might not lose.

This was balance!

Originally, Wan Tiansheng didn't want those two to enter, but now, he couldn't wait any longer.

He couldn't endure any longer!

As for whether Su Yu had any more tricks... he actually knew a bit. Su Yu had the Sanctification Seal, maybe one more big use, but it was best not to use the Sanctification Seal. Once used, Su Yu's greatest guarantee against the master of rules would be gone!

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng no longer hesitated, no longer waited, and shouted, "Tongtian!"

Let them in!

And at this moment, below, the six strong beings suddenly ascended simultaneously!

Dizhi Luo and the others smiled!

At this moment, fifteen supreme experts, except for the Undead Emperor who chose not to participate, all others chose to join the battle.

Indeed, no one could resist various temptations.

Moreover, victory seemed within reach.

Killing Su Yu didn't seem difficult at this moment.

Four Heavenly Sovereigns joining forces could instantly kill Fat Ball, then kill Wan Tiansheng and the others. Even if Su Yu was powerful, he would find it hard to escape death.

At this moment, Su Yu's eyes turned icy, and he punched the undead giant, intending to step out of the Death Path. Yes, stepping out, this time might be a failure.

But failing to resurrect was better than having the strong below killed.

Just as Su Yu was about to step out of the path, he heard the carefree laughter of Marquis Tongtian, "Your Majesty, we have come to assist!"

At this moment, Su Yu sensed two auras.

...

At the same time.

Marquis Tongtian's laughter echoed in the ears of Giant Axe and another, "Gentlemen, His Majesty needs assistance, trouble has arrived, and we hope you can help kill the enemy!"

Giant Axe was still thinking, a small matter!

How big a deal could it be?

Just say which Heavenly King needs to be killed. After all, without a Heavenly King, it would be hard to deal with Su Yu and his group, especially with Fat Ball around.

However, the moment he was teleported out, Giant Axe was stunned.

March was also stunned!

The two of them appeared in an instant.

Upon appearing, they instantly sensed dozens of incredibly powerful auras!

Heavenly Kings!

Heavenly Sovereigns!

At this moment, right beside them, there were five Heavenly Sovereigns, seventeen Heavenly Kings, and one... unfathomable presence, possibly a true master of the power of laws. 

In that instant, Giant Axe wondered, "Have I returned to the ancient times? Or is this the Upper Realm?" 

A master of laws, five Heavenly Sovereigns, seventeen Heavenly Kings... and that didn't even count the auras rising in the distance. 

Moreover, there were two powerful auras in the distance. One belonged to Su Yu, and the other to Su Yu's necromancer giant. At this moment, both exuded the aura of a Heavenly Sovereign. 

In this place, in the blink of an eye, they sensed seven Heavenly Sovereign auras! 

Where is this place? 

That was Giant Axe's first thought. 

"Who am I supposed to fight?" 

That was his second thought. 

"That black dog seems familiar, yet unfamiliar." 

That was his third thought. 

At this moment, countless thoughts flashed through Giant Axe's mind. Not only him, but March also stood there in a daze, with countless thoughts rising. 

He had already recognized the others! 

Recognized this group of Heavenly Sovereigns and Heavenly Kings! 

The living ones were all on Su Yu's side, while the dead seemed to be powerful figures from the Death Realm. 

Giant Axe and March were still in shock, and the other necromancers were also momentarily stunned by the sudden appearance of two powerful beings. 

Dizhi Luo and his group all had their expressions change! 

How did two more Heavenly Sovereigns suddenly appear! 

They were shocked, and so were Giant Axe and his group. But Wan Tiansheng, who was orchestrating everything, was not. At this moment, his voice boomed like a great bell, shouting, "Senior March, kill the necromancers, kill the necromancers here!" 

Boom! 

A giant bamboo appeared, born out of reflex! 

March was actually bewildered, and Giant Axe was even more so, but... he still heard the words to kill the necromancers. 

At this moment, Giant Axe also swung his axe. 

As he swung, he was still somewhat bewildered. 

The two of them appeared in an instant and struck in an instant. In the blink of an eye, a bamboo and an axe sent six strong figures who had just flown up crashing down with a thunderous boom! 

"Kill!" 

Seeing this, Wan Tiansheng and his group were overjoyed and roared in anger. The Great Zhou King, who had been using the path of endurance, suddenly roared, and his combat power exploded. He could endure no more, and there was no need to endure any longer! 

This was the explosive power of enduring to the extreme! 

"Endure... until death!" 

The Great Zhou King roared in fury, and in his hand, a massive black hole of space appeared! 

Boom! 

The black hole exploded, tearing through the void, ripping a necromancer Heavenly King into pieces. Just as the necromancer's mark appeared, Su Yu's voice boomed from afar, "Throw it into the Celestial River of Death, South King, devour it all!" 

Not only the South King, but when the second necromancer Heavenly King was killed, Su Yu actively triggered the necromancer pages hidden in the Dragonblood Marquis's Great Dao. 

The commotion was enormous! 

At this moment, even if it would draw attention and be discovered, Su Yu didn't care! 

He had the Dragonblood Marquis and these powerful figures actively strip the combat power of the deceased Heavenly Kings to prevent the necromancer giant from utilizing it! 

With a thunderous boom, the Great Zhou King punched the necromancer mark into the Celestial River of Death above, and then the necromancer mark exploded in the Death Dao. 

The second Heavenly King fell in battle! 

And Giant Axe and March were still in a daze. They had just arrived, and they... they had already witnessed a Heavenly King fall in battle. 

Is this really the Death Realm? 

Here, is it really so easy to kill a Heavenly King? 

At this moment, further away, September roared, his Heavenly King aura erupting. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King also erupted with pseudo-path Heavenly King auras, roaring as they charged towards the Celestial River of Death! 

Over there, powerful figures were also awakening, and there were Heavenly King-level existences. 

The Great Qin King and the others had all become pseudo-path Heavenly Kings. Although their true combat power was inferior, their auras were similar. 

"So many Heavenly Kings..." 

Giant Axe muttered, truly stunned. 

Where did they come from? 

So many! 

They're everywhere! 

Where exactly is this place? 

Is it the Death Realm? 

But this place is nothing like the Death Realm I know. 

The Death Realm I know only has four Heavenly Kings. 

But... but here... his eyes were dazzled. There were over twenty Heavenly Kings, right? 

Where did they all come from? 

There were so many Heavenly Sovereigns! 

Here, killing a Heavenly King seemed easier than killing a Daofuse. In the Upper Realm, Daofuse didn't die like this, except when Su Yu was involved. 

And this time, it seemed like Su Yu was orchestrating the war again. 

Wasn't he defeated? 

Wasn't he fleeing to the Death Realm? 

Then... why could he still incite a war of this scale? 

Just as he was thinking, with a thunderous boom, death energy surged, and a necromancer Heavenly Sovereign instantly charged at him. 

Two necromancer Heavenly Sovereigns and four necromancer Heavenly Kings all charged at the two of them. 

Someone even shouted angrily, "Kill them, Su Yu indeed has a backup plan!" 

Four Heavenly Sovereigns, plus ten Heavenly Kings... well, now it's eight! 

But even so, it's an incredibly powerful force. 

But the other side is also very strong, with three Heavenly Sovereigns and eight Heavenly Kings. 

Suddenly, these necromancers understood why the Necromancer Emperor didn't join the battle. Why did Su Yu's side have more Heavenly Sovereigns appearing, and two at that? 

Both sides were in shock! 

Giant Axe and March were shocked by the number of powerful figures, and the necromancers were shocked by Su Yu's many backup plans. Two Heavenly Sovereigns couldn't just appear out of nowhere. 

"Kill!" 

Wan Tiansheng roared, "Two esteemed ones, kill them!" 

Boom! 

The battle erupted once more. 

March and Giant Axe were bewildered, but they knew one thing: just fight. 

At this moment, Giant Axe was utterly bewildered, but he made a precise judgment and quickly transmitted to Wan Tiansheng, "Um... there's a terrifying presence below, what should we do?" 

He thought these people hadn't sensed it. 

But soon, he received a reply from Wan Tiansheng, who quickly said, "Don't worry about that person, we've already taken care of it!" 

Alright! 

Giant Axe was speechless! 

These days, can even necromancers at the level of a master of laws be dealt with? 

He was still pondering when suddenly, a powerful aura surged from the opening above. The South King, who had just fused with the source, instantly reached the Heavenly Sovereign domain! 

Not only that, but the aura continued to grow stronger. 

The South King let out a piercing scream and, at the fastest speed, instead of rushing out from the opening, charged into the Death Dao, heading towards Su Yu's direction, and slapped dead a necromancer who was about to advance to Heavenly King! 

Boom! 

The necromancer who had just received a reward exploded directly. The South King's voice was cold and stern as she shouted, "Audacious! Emperor Yu fights for your lives, dare to betray, kill them!" 

"Kill them!" 

At this moment, from all directions, a multitude of powerful figures roared furiously. 

"Defy Emperor Yu's will, and you shall be slain!" 

Around Giant Axe and March, the Great Zhou King and others also roared madly, "Defy Emperor Yu, and you shall be executed for treason!" 

Boom! 

Battles erupted from all directions! 

Giant Axe and March were utterly stunned. 

Damn! 

How many powerful figures are there? 

Is this... is this still the pitiful Su Yu they imagined? The other side, in the Death Realm, actually commanded several Heavenly Sovereigns, over ten Heavenly Kings, and over a hundred Daofuse! 

With this situation, are we still sympathizing with Su Yu? 

Forget it! 

One man and one cat exchanged glances again, and without a word, they just fought. Damn it, they were completely dumbfounded today, but it didn't matter! 

Who cares! 

Just kill, the necromancers here can be killed! 

"Die!" 

Giant Axe swung horizontally, and the giant bamboo struck! 

Just fight! 

Seven Heavenly Sovereign-level powerhouses instantly clashed, and on Wan Tiansheng's side, sixteen Heavenly King powerhouses engaged in a fierce battle in the blink of an eye. 

A group of terrifying beings fought with the sky and earth turning upside down! 

... 

In the necromancer passage. 

The next moment, another roar erupted, and Marquis Lanshan's source fused. In an instant, she fully possessed the aura of a Heavenly King, and not only that, but the aura continued to rise, faintly touching the Heavenly Sovereign domain! 

She and the South King instantly charged out, killing the rebellious beings in the passage on the spot! 

At this moment, the South King already possessed Heavenly Sovereign combat power, and Marquis Lanshan was also a Heavenly King existence. The Heavenly King-level powerhouse Tianhuo, who had entered earlier, also roared madly, his aura growing, reaching the Heavenly Sovereign domain. 

Tianhuo's black flames surged, directly burning all the rebellious necromancers around him to death, merging them into the Death Dao. 

Tianhuo, from the Fire God Race, coldly shouted, "Since everyone agreed, you should keep your promise. The human race gave you a chance, and if you act now, you break your promise. Breaking a promise... means death!" 

The three powerful figures quickly cleared the passage of some rebels, slaughtering the necromancers who killed their companions, causing the necromancers in the passage to flee continuously. 

... 

At the breach. 

Su Yu smiled. 

A pleasant surprise! 

Not because of the South King and the others, but because of the appearance of March and Giant Axe. 

Their appearance could prevent his failure. 

If this resurrection failed, it would be a huge loss for Su Yu. 

Su Yu looked at the giant opposite him and smiled, "You... seem incapable!" 

The necromancer giant, now possessing Heavenly Sovereign combat power, replied coldly and mechanically, "You're laughing too early!" 

Have you won? 

You haven't won! 

But Su Yu smiled, "I've always avoided provoking you. This time, I just wanted to resurrect some friends, but you obstructed me. Fine, since you obstructed me, I won't be polite!" 

At this moment, Su Yu ignored him. Even if this guy became a Heavenly Sovereign, he couldn't match him now, so what was there to fear? 

He coldly looked towards the direction of the seal. 

Su Yu took a deep breath and smiled. 

The Necromancer Emperor didn't join the battle! 

Good! 

Otherwise, this time, perhaps he could try to slay a powerhouse with the combat power of a master of laws. 

Su Yu didn't say much; wealth was an external thing. 

Wan Tiansheng wanted to save him some trouble, but it wasn't necessary. 

At this moment, he took out the Sanctification Seal. 

This thing, after this time, would probably be useless. 

But... it was enough! 

Su Yu sneered, and under the frowning gaze of the necromancer giant, he suddenly threw the Sanctification Seal towards the sealed place. 

At this moment, a large seal instantly expanded countless times! 

It covered the sky and the sun! 

A force of the sacred path erupted instantly. 

...

Chapter 799: The End of Destiny

On the seventh floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion, the Martial Emperor's avatar trembled slightly.

Su Yu... even this was thrown out?

Truly extravagant!

This guy is indeed a madman among madmen. To think this thing was originally meant to deal with me. Well, I'm lucky.

The Martial Emperor secretly rejoiced.

Not bad at all!

At that moment, a massive seal covered the entire sky. Su Yu's voice echoed throughout the heavens and earth, stirring the hearts of the dead spirits. He shouted, "Slay all the sealed realm's experts except for the Necrolord! Traitors, be executed!"

Traitors!

He had defined it directly. This Death Realm belonged to the Necrolord, but at this moment, I am the master!

...

"Ridiculous!"

Dizhi Luo and his companions sneered.

Do you think you can kill us just because you want to?

However, when the massive seal shot towards them, the crowd felt a chill. The four Heavenly Sovereigns sensed it and their expressions changed, ready to flee.

But then they remembered—they were still within the sealed realm.

Where could they run?

The Heavenly Kings hadn't sensed the danger yet, but the Heavenly Sovereigns had. One of them shouted, "Emperor, please intervene!"

Trouble was coming!

The Necrolord frowned slightly. He didn't want to get involved, but... he looked at the Sanctification Seal covering the sky and sighed inwardly. Dangerous.

No way I'm stepping in!

At this moment, he couldn't act.

"I knew it!"

The Necrolord thought to himself, I knew it, anyone capable of opening the heavens isn't simple.

Indeed, countless backup plans.

He was wary of this seal.

As he pondered, the seal shot forward.

It pierced through Fat Ball and the others, and the next moment, a brilliant holy light erupted, covering the Death Realm.

The seal shattered instantly!

Yet, in that moment of shattering, more holy light emerged, targeting the dead spirits specifically.

Dizhi Luo was the first to be affected, suddenly freezing, his eyes dull.

In battle, freezing, dull eyes, and sluggish thoughts meant only one thing—death!

At that moment, the eight Heavenly Kings of Wan Tiansheng struck Dizhi Luo simultaneously!

This guy was too annoying!

Everyone wanted to kill him!

Boom!

Assimilated by the holy light, Dizhi Luo, in his final moment, regained some clarity, eyes wide as he sensed the powerful auras closing in, filled with unwillingness and disbelief!

"No!"

I haven't broken the seal yet!

I haven't escaped yet!

I still want to be reborn, I still want so much, how can I die here?

But there were no ifs.

When Su Yu threw out the Sanctification Seal, it meant he was utterly determined to destroy them, at any cost. Wan Tiansheng and the others felt Su Yu's resolve.

Kill at all costs!

Especially Dizhi Luo, the first to be sanctified. If not him, then who?

Boom!

Dizhi Luo was torn apart, even his necromantic mark shattered!

The Death Realm trembled once more.

In his dying moment, Dizhi Luo suddenly thought of something, screaming, "Even if I die, you won't have it easy! Our Dao's source power will only create stronger beings!"

So what if you kill us?

There will still be powerful dead spirits rising!

They'll come for you again!

Boom!

His voice was shattered!

The holy light continued to radiate, covering the heavens.

Fifteen strong beings, excluding the Necrolord, three had already been slain, leaving eleven, all enveloped by the holy light!

The Sanctification Seal, given to Su Yu by the Culture King to deal with the Martial Emperor!

If it could suppress the Martial Emperor, what about others?

The Martial Emperor was a powerful existence among the rulers of laws. If he could be suppressed, Su Yu had originally intended to save it for a ruler of laws. But now, he was fed up with those guys and worried about potential casualties among Wan Tiansheng's group!

It wasn't impossible!

With equal strength, even lacking a Heavenly Sovereign, Su Yu didn't want to see any losses!

So, he used the Sanctification Seal.

A treasure, if not used now, might never be used. If it could be used, then use it!

Eleven strong beings, all covered by the holy light!

Boom!

Fat Ball and the others seized the opportunity, striking out!

Heaven and earth shattered!

...

Below, the Necrolord's expression changed.

It's over!

To be honest, these people had been sealed with him for many years, and there was some sentiment.

But now, they didn't listen, insisted on going up, and now look, not only did they provoke two Heavenly Sovereigns, but Su Yu, this madman, even used a treasure capable of killing a ruler of laws, willing to shatter it just to deal with them.

This... just shows Su Yu is ruthless, and you are too foolish!

"No!"

"Emperor, save me!"

"Don't kill me..."

Boom!

A cacophony of explosions echoed through the heavens.

Many dead spirits, awakened by the powerful force at the last moment, let out wretched roars.

No, this wasn't the outcome they had hoped for!

They wanted to unseal, to become Heavenly Sovereigns, to become rulers of laws!

Sealed for years, they had longed for the day of unsealing.

They had imagined countless times what to do after unsealing, what to enjoy.

But now, it was all gone!

"Su Yu, you won't die a good death..."

Someone cursed!

But it was useless.

Boom, the first loud explosion occurred, a Heavenly Sovereign was blown apart by Fat Ball and the others, no, or rather, stomped to pieces by a boot!

This was the first, Wan Tiansheng and the others joined forces, blowing apart other Heavenly Kings!

The fourth Heavenly King, the fifth, the sixth...

Covered by the Sanctification Seal, they were almost all in a state of stagnation, and in battle, even a delay of a tenth of a second meant death!

At this moment, black pillars of light shattered!

A massive amount of necromantic power spilled out!

The entire Death Realm shook violently, even the Death Dao was greatly affected, starting to tremble violently.

Fifteen supreme beings, almost in the blink of an eye, were slaughtered!

Fourteen strong beings, including four Heavenly Sovereigns.

But at this moment, everyone saw that when Su Yu threw out that seal, these guys were doomed!

Indeed, they were doomed!

In a series of desperate roars, in the blink of an eye, fourteen strong beings were blown apart by Wan Tiansheng and the others!

And the disappearance of these fourteen top-tier beings also meant that a powerful source of power would spill out, benefiting others!

At this moment, the entire Death Realm was deathly silent!

The Dao trembled violently!

Opposite Su Yu, even the necromantic giant was somewhat shaken. This guy was too crazy!

And at this moment, Su Yu shouted, "South King, absorb the spilled source power, don't let the Death Dao reclaim it!"

...

With Su Yu's shout, the giant opposite snorted coldly, suddenly trembling, also drawing on the residual source power from the fall of the fourteen necromantic strong beings!

At the same time, the South King and the others erupted, absorbing the source power, and both sides began a tug-of-war.

And at this moment, both the giant and the South King vaguely sensed a third party was actually stealing this power!

However, neither side minded giving this powerful source power to a third party!

...

In the distance.

The Dragonblood Marquis's eyes were filled with a strange mix of shock, fear, and joy!

Shocked at Su Yu's hidden cards, fearful of the many strong beings that had just died, joyful that... he seemed to have good luck, absorbing a large amount of source power!

Between the South King and the necromantic giant, neither seemed to mind giving the source power to a third party.

As a result, the Dragonblood Marquis benefited!

At this moment, the Dragonblood Marquis's aura seemed to have a breakthrough, but he suppressed it, his heart filled with joy.

I... seem to have almost instantly stepped into the Heavenly Sovereign!

He was trembling with excitement!

Am I the biggest winner?

With so many strong beings dead, can I... become a ruler of laws?

Become the true master of the Death Realm!

At this moment, he was excited, thrilled, even forgetting some anomalies in the Dao just now!

...

And at this moment, Su Yu sneered inwardly, your destiny's child should end here!

At this moment, he didn't mind the Dragonblood Marquis absorbing a bit more power!

PS: Next chapter will be later, too tired, stayed up with the kid till dawn, going crazy.  
(End of Chapter)
