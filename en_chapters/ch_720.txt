Chapter 720: Insights from the River of the Great Dao

"Everyone's fishing, just to see whose methods are superior?"

"What a pity, the Human Emperor was forced to stop opening the path."

"The Culture King... what a pit! No, the Martial King is the real pit!"

Su Yu muttered to himself. The Culture King left to save his sister, which was understandable, but the Martial King running away too was a real letdown. The Human Emperor must have been heavily inconvenienced.

Su Yu pondered, wondering what expression the Human Emperor had when the Culture King and Martial King left one after the other. Was he dumbfounded like a dog?

Truly tragic!

I was halfway through opening the path, and you two ran off. The myriad races revolted, and I couldn't continue. I had to take those experts away. If it were Su Yu, he would probably want to vomit blood.

He chuckled, imagining the scene back then. It must have been quite amusing.

"Ownerless paths of rules are all false paths!"

"They lack stability, but they can indeed make one stronger and are easier to comprehend."

At this moment, Su Yu looked at the place where he was sitting. In this vicinity, there were quite a few of these ownerless paths.

Without the Human Emperor, who was like a fisherman, the danger wasn't significant. Otherwise, it would be easy to be harvested.

"Has no one been to the place where I am?"

"It feels quite easy to get here."

"Is it the suppression effect of Little Stone?"

Su Yu speculated that perhaps the suppression effect of Little Stone was excellent. Coming here didn't put much pressure on him. Others might not be able to come, otherwise, why fight over ownerless great daos elsewhere when they could just seize them here without being shattered?

"A great place!"

"Whether to supplement one's own path of rules or to rebuild a great dao, this place is a treasure!"

As he spoke, Su Yu absorbed some of the ownerless power of laws, slightly strengthening his own great dao.

Here, he could vaguely sense the presence of the pen dao. However, to fully connect with the pen dao, it would be best to enter the true River of Time.

"Slightly strengthening the pen dao is no problem..."

"Or find a way to enter the true River of Time!"

Once in the true River of Time, connecting with the great dao of the River of Time, even if he couldn't reach the pen dao's range, Su Yu could still strengthen himself more quickly.

Killing people, that's a minor issue. No rush!

With these thoughts, Su Yu stood up, intending to fly upwards and go against the current to see the real junction point.

However, after flying for a while, he found it difficult to ascend!

Su Yu tried flying several times, but the turbulent waterfall kept pushing him back down.

This place was easy to descend but hard to ascend!

Su Yu frowned slightly, thought for a moment, and suddenly a faint celestial aura emerged from his body.

Then, he let out a low roar and tore open the grid below.

He should be able to go down here too!

He had just heard someone shouting.

Since he couldn't go up, then... go down!

With his immense strength, he tore a small opening in the grid, and with a roar, Su Yu dove into it!

...

Meanwhile.

A broken great dao had just appeared. At this moment, in a massive canyon, seven or eight Daofuse experts were fighting over it, battling fiercely.

Suddenly, the sky cracked open!

In an instant, a figure appeared.

The combatants all turned to look at the newcomer.

"An Immortal?"

Someone exclaimed softly. Damn it, another Immortal expert had arrived!

There were two Immortal Daofuse experts here, and they were overjoyed at the sight. One of them quickly shouted, "Come quickly..."

Rip!

Su Yu, who had just appeared, glanced at the situation and instantly tore through the Human Emperor's great dao, disappearing from the spot.

Silence reigned!

Everyone was stunned. An Immortal expert who had just seized a great dao was momentarily dumbfounded, then wanted to curse!

Damn it!

Who was that bastard?

Unfamiliar!

Of course, familiarity didn't matter. What mattered was that this bastard appeared and quickly ran away.

What was the meaning of this?

As for Su Yu's sudden appearance, they assumed he had broken through from the River of Time.

Since that guy came, why run?

The few remaining experts were initially worried that the newcomer might join the fray and be hard to deal with.

But he vanished in the blink of an eye!

A Daofuse expert from the Demon Race was overjoyed, laughing heartily, "Marquis Yusheng, it seems your fellow Immortal doesn't want to get involved. You'd better hand over the great dao!"

"Kill!"

The group quickly charged at the two Immortal experts. As for the one who had appeared and disappeared suddenly, they just needed to be a bit cautious.

Since he ran, he might not come back.

Of course, he might be calling for reinforcements.

In any case, a quick battle was the best strategy!

As for Su Yu, no one pursued him. Why chase him? Wasn't that crazy?

The great dao wasn't in that guy's hands!

The battle erupted again, and the two Immortal experts were extremely frustrated. They had just gotten lucky and seized the broken great dao, only to find themselves surrounded by many Daofuse experts. They had hoped the sudden newcomer would help, but he vanished before they could even get a good look at him, only knowing he was an Immortal expert.

"Who was that bastard just now?"

"When we get back to the council, we must report him!"

"......"

The two Immortal experts communicated as they quickly fled.

They were both deeply frustrated, having been given hope by the newcomer's appearance, only for him to irresponsibly run away.

...

At this moment, Su Yu couldn't care less about them.

Seven or eight Daofuse experts, though not many, were still not something Su Yu wanted to get entangled with.

If they teamed up against him, Su Yu wouldn't be able to handle it.

He wasn't at the Heavenly King level!

At this moment, Su Yu once again tore through the River of Time, entering it. This time, he didn't appear at the bottom of the waterfall.

This time, Su Yu didn't go downstream but upstream.

With Little Stone's suppression, Su Yu moved quickly.

He flew upstream along the great dao!

On both sides of the great dao, there were still some scattered tributaries, likely false paths extracted from the Human Emperor's great dao, and now people were probably cultivating them.

This time, the core of the "Responsibility" path didn't appear.

Perhaps Su Yu's irresponsible leap earlier made the power of this great dao think he was unreliable, so it entered a re-evaluation state.

Su Yu didn't care about this. It was better if it didn't appear.

The Human Emperor's path was too strong. If he inherited it, he might not be able to escape its influence. He preferred to continue with his own pen dao, which was much weaker.

"It's not necessary to inherit it... If it doesn't work, I'll find a way to steal the Human Emperor's great dao power!"

Su Yu suddenly had this thought.

The Mark of Civilization nurtures paths, but it still lacks the power of laws, especially since Su Yu wants to nurture myriad paths. The Human Emperor's side has extraction mechanisms, and it's ownerless. No one is managing the Human Emperor's path.

"Yes!"

Su Yu's eyes sparkled. Why not steal the Human Emperor's great dao power?

"Unfortunately, I don't have enough book pages. The others are all nurturing paths. Maybe one day I'll extract them and come here to steal power to nurture my own virtual great dao!"

The more he thought about it, the more excited Su Yu became.

Yes!

That's the plan. The Human Emperor's path is ownerless.

I can steal as much as I want. The Human Emperor can't come back.

The Human Emperor stole from the River of Time, so I'll steal from the Human Emperor.

If the Human Emperor really returns, Su Yu would even laugh and say, "You're finally back." If the Human Emperor returns, who would care about the human race? I wouldn't have to manage it!

With these thoughts, Su Yu quickly flew forward.

He wanted to see the junction point, which would be more suitable for him to strengthen his pen dao.

Strengthen himself first!

Even if he couldn't go to the lower realm, he had to see how far the junction was from him.

The further he flew, the more Su Yu felt the presence.

The power of the pen dao was getting closer!

Clearly, the gap wasn't small, and the power of the pen dao could radiate over.

As he flew, Su Yu suddenly paused.

He didn't know how far he had flown, but it wasn't close. At this moment, what did he see?

He didn't see the gap, but in the Human Emperor's river, he seemed to see a person!

A person who was locked up!

It seemed to be just a projection, a phantom, struggling violently.

That phantom seemed to sense something.

Disheveled, it suddenly looked towards Su Yu!

The figure was in a massive tributary, right between the tributary and the main path.

And Su Yu also saw the surging river ahead. It seemed that this place wasn't far from the mouth of the River of Time, just nearby.

The tributary where the figure was located, upon closer inspection, seemed to be formed by the intersection of multiple tributaries, locking the figure tightly.

Simply put, it was locked by some false paths!

The figure struggled, and in its struggle, it looked towards Su Yu, as if sensing someone had arrived, as if a voice came from another time and space, filled with anger and unwillingness, "Who is it?"

"Release this king!"

Rumble!

Several tributary great daos trembled continuously, and the figure roared violently.

"If this king gets out, I'll kill you all!"

"Yue Luo, Yue Luo... why!"

"......"

Rumble!

The figure seemed to be very agitated, as if it hadn't spoken to anyone or seen anyone for many years.

At this moment, even sensing some aura from afar, it became excited and roared.

It was locked here by the tributary great daos!

And Su Yu slowed his pace, with a peculiar expression.

Hundred Battle?

Hundred Battle was locked here!

"Locked by the great dao... not just one."

Su Yu's eyes flickered with interest.

Several experts had locked Hundred Battle.

Right near this junction.

"Was he fighting in the lower realm and then got knocked through the River of Time, ending up here through the gap?"

"No... the lower realm entrance!"

Su Yu's heart stirred. The lower realm entrance was also in this area.

That means this Human Emperor's river might have a lower realm entrance.

Was Hundred Battle knocked up there?

So he was locked in this area near the lower realm entrance and junction.

"So he was sealed here, locked by several great daos, no wonder he couldn't escape..."

Su Yu observed from afar for a while. The figure was just a projection, not the real person.

Hundred Battle must be in some place in the Source of the Dao, suppressed by someone.

Someone was watching over him, not leaving him unattended.

In the Land of Dao Source, a massive mountain known as the Sealed Mountain stood ominously. It was rumored to imprison the Hundred Battle King. Though the truth of this claim was uncertain, thousands of years ago, the mountain had indeed erupted with the aura of the Hundred Battle King, prompting a rescue attempt.

The Sealed Mountain was a place few dared to visit, as it was fraught with danger. The power of laws was extremely volatile here. Today, a sudden, thunderous boom shook the mountain, and shadows of invisible chains appeared above it.

A beast-like roar echoed in all directions, and barriers manifested around the mountain. In the next moment, ancient, decaying figures, bathed in the light of ages, emerged. One of these decrepit beings coughed and wheezed, "It's suddenly agitated. Is it sensing the opening of the Lower Realm and trying to break free?"

From afar, a voice replied softly, "Once the Lower Realm opens, the River of Time will be turbulent, and the power of laws will dissipate. Suppressing him then will be much harder... Even after all these years, he's still so powerful... Truly, he's the closest to becoming a master of the laws!"

"Perhaps he already is," another ancient voice chimed in.

They had lived for countless years, stationed here for millennia, dealing with this madman who constantly struggled and was difficult to manage.

"His power isn't what it used to be," someone suggested. "We should weaken him further, or he'll be too hard to handle."

Though they had been draining his power for years, the Hundred Battle King, who had achieved the path through his physical body, remained formidable. Even after six thousand years without absorbing the power of laws, his physical strength was still immense.

Someone proposed entering to kill him, but an ancient voice quickly advised caution, "Don't act rashly. If we enter and the seal breaks... If he escapes, it will be a disaster! Sealing him has its benefits. At least it prevents the Human Race from producing another powerhouse like him, or even reaching the Daofuse Realm..."

Why kill the Hundred Battle King? There was no need for that now. Keeping him sealed ensured that the Human Race couldn't produce another supreme physical cultivator. It was a win-win situation. Killing him or letting him escape would both be major problems.

"Indeed... Let's wait a few more years until the Lower Realm opens... But why did he suddenly become agitated today?"

"We're not sure."

"Could it be an issue with the River of Time?"

"Unlikely. Neither of us can reach that area, nor can anyone else."

The decaying elders continued their discussion, appearing from all directions to maintain the suppression. Chains of laws sealed the entire mountain, confirming the rumors that the Hundred Battle King was indeed imprisoned here. However, no one could approach; those who did had to leave immediately, or they would face the danger brought by these ancient elders.

Meanwhile, Su Yu was nearing the chaotic tributaries of the River of Time. The figure continued to roar.

"This king has found you!"

"Who are you?"

"Are you spying on this king from within the River of Time?"

The shadow struggled violently, but Su Yu noticed that several tributaries were suppressing it. Moreover, the shadow seemed to be bound by a power not from the tributaries but from the distant River of Time.

"A seal from the Control King's lineage?" Su Yu pondered. This meant the Hundred Battle King was doubly suppressed—by the Control King's lineage and by several pseudo-dao experts.

"Unexpectedly, I encountered the Hundred Battle King here..." Su Yu was secretly astonished. Of course, rescuing the Hundred Battle King was out of the question. The nearby tributaries felt formidable, likely housing Heavenly King-level experts. Even if they were pseudo-dao, they were still Heavenly Kings. Even if Su Yu could disperse some of the power of laws, a group of top-tier Daofuse experts could easily kill him.

I'd be a fool to risk myself for the Hundred Battle King! I'm hiding well; I can't let this guy expose me. Su Yu quickly concealed all his aura, neither responding nor engaging. The Hundred Battle King was a fool; he deserved to be suppressed. Su Yu was more concerned about this guy interfering with him.

Seeing the Hundred Battle King so miserably suppressed, Su Yu felt no sympathy. Hundreds of Daofuse experts had died, burying the foundation of the Human Race. The Hundred Battle King was lucky to still be alive despite his miserable state.

"Where is the entrance to the Lower Realm?" Su Yu didn't look at the Hundred Battle King. As he concealed his aura, the Hundred Battle King couldn't sense anything and quieted down, seemingly disappointed that no one was there.

The aura vanished! He had only vaguely sensed some presence, but now it was gone. Since it was gone, there was no need to waste energy roaring. He would slowly erode the sealing power instead.

With the Hundred Battle King no longer roaring, Su Yu continued to observe the area. "Inhale..." He took a deep breath, marveling at the Hundred Battle King's strength. Su Yu observed closely and discovered six tributaries sealing him!

This indicated that six pseudo-dao experts were suppressing him. And this might not be all. If there were true dao experts who hadn't switched paths, they wouldn't be observable, at least not in the Human Emperor's River of Time.

"At least six, possibly more..." Su Yu speculated that these pseudo-dao experts might all possess Heavenly King-level strength. If there were true dao experts, the suppression of the Hundred Battle King would likely involve Heavenly King-level combat power.

A sealed Hundred Battle King had mobilized so many experts; he was indeed extraordinary! "This guy's strength is truly formidable!" Su Yu hadn't interacted with the Hundred Battle King, only seeing his projection, similar to when he encountered the Martial Emperor in the River of Time. The Martial Emperor was also sealed, but Su Yu had seen his projection in the River of Time.

However, the Martial Emperor seemed closer to being unsealed than the Hundred Battle King, appearing more comfortable. "Truly pitiful, one Hundred Battle King, one Martial Emperor... Why does everyone like sealing people?" Su Yu chuckled, feeling no sympathy but rather a bit of schadenfreude.

"Rescuing the Hundred Battle King... Marquis Zhennan and the others think it's so simple. Six people going in would be a death sentence!" Su Yu thought to himself, deciding not to look at the Hundred Battle King anymore. It wasn't worth it since he had no intention of rescuing him.

He quickly scanned the surroundings, wondering why he couldn't see the entrance to the Lower Realm. "Usually, killing people alerts the Upper Realm, and many must die for that to happen. This suggests that the entrance, if it truly connects to the Human Emperor's River of Time, is likely well-hidden. Only when many die, causing a significant disturbance in the laws, can it be sensed."

"Hidden... But can it hide from my Heaven Gate's detection?" Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate to its fullest, suspecting the entrance might be near the Hundred Battle King's seal. After all, it was said that the Hundred Battle King fought in the Lower Realm. It was unlikely they dragged him to the Upper Realm for sealing; sealing him during the battle was more plausible.

Su Yu's forehead glowed with divine light as he opened his Heaven Gate to its maximum. It should be relatively easy to find, Su Yu thought. This place wasn't like the true River of Time, with countless paths. Here, there were only a few tributaries.

"Is it at the riverbed?" Su Yu mused. If it were on the sides, it might be discovered. If it were at the riverbed, it would be more concealed. "However, it's hard to say. Back then, Human Realm experts had to travel between the Upper and Lower Realms. They couldn't have emerged from the riverbed every time..."

After several deductions, Su Yu concluded it might not be at the riverbed. Even if it were, there should be a tributary connecting it, allowing passage between the Upper and Lower Realms.

"The River of Time in the Lower Realm and the Human Emperor's River of Time in the Upper Realm, supported by forces from both ends, maintain this passage's existence?" Su Yu continued scanning, knowing that maintaining this passage would inevitably consume the power of laws.

Wherever the power of laws was being consumed might be where the passage was located. Once he found the passage, if Soul Burying Mountain was discovered, he could take a risk and escape through this passage. It was dangerous, but with Little Stone's strong suppression effect, he might not die.

If those like the Weapon King and Talisman King could descend, forcing his way down might not kill him either. As Su Yu's Heaven Gate probed, he gradually sensed some fluctuations. Not far from the Hundred Battle King's seal, there seemed to be a small vortex drawing a bit of the power of laws.

Su Yu quickly flew toward it! Upon reaching the vortex, Su Yu observed his surroundings, then gritted his teeth and suddenly dove into the riverbed. The surging power of laws battered Su Yu, but Little Stone absorbed most of it.

As he submerged, Su Yu saw it—right beside the river's barrier. There was a small opening!

"An exit to the Lower Realm?" Su Yu assessed, and it seemed highly likely! Tributary paths opened on the river's surface, but this was a tributary path beneath the surface, likely the entrance to the Lower Realm.

"So, the entrance to the Lower Realm doesn't usually manifest, but when many die in the Lower Realm, causing a significant disturbance in the laws, those of the same path might sense this opening's existence!"

The design was quite hidden and complex! Su Yu hesitated for a moment, then sent a faint wisp of willpower into the small tributary. As soon as it entered... Boom!

A turbulent stream surged, shattering a wisp of Su Yu's willpower into fragments. His eyes lit up with realization—it was a passageway!

He had ascended through the Torchbearer's passage, and the aura felt similar. This was indeed the passage to the Lower Realm.

"No wonder it's usually undiscovered, and no messages can be sent through. Anyone who recklessly barges in might be struck down by the power of the Great Dao!"

...

At the same time, in the Lower Realm, within the Fate Realm, atop Fate Mountain, the Fate Emperor was entertaining a guest.

Wan Tiansheng!

With Su Yu and his companions gone, Wan Tiansheng had taken on the responsibility of overseeing the myriad realms, especially focusing on the three major realms and the Fate Realm. The Great Qin King and others would be suppressed upon entering the Fate Realm, and among the human experts, only Wan Tiansheng had the potential to suppress the Fate Emperor.

Half a month had passed since Su Yu's departure. Wan Tiansheng was either guarding the Human Realm or patrolling the myriad realms. Today, he had arrived at the Fate Realm.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng was observing the heavens. After a while, seeing nothing unusual, he softly asked, "No movements from the Upper Realm recently?"

The Fate Emperor smiled, "None. In the Lower Realm, unless the three major races sacrifice their Sunmoon Realm experts again to disperse the punitive forces, only then might there be some fluctuations that could alert the Upper Realm experts to the passage's location and the slight dissipation of punitive forces... only then would they have hope of descending!"

"Since the Marquis of Meteor Star and others were killed, Tiangu and the others aren't foolish enough to do that. Dispelling some forces might attract more Upper Realm experts, which would be dangerous!"

Tiangu and his group had ceased such actions. In the current Lower Realm, humans held supremacy. The Fate Clan was likely to side with Su Yu. If more experts descended and the Fate Clan was suppressed, with the Fate Emperor and human experts taking action, slaying a few Daofuse Realm experts would be an immense loss.

Wan Tiansheng nodded, having anticipated that Tiangu and his group wouldn't continue such actions. Losing a large number of Sunmoon Realm experts and potentially endangering Daofuse Realm experts—only fools would persist!

Without being able to fully open the passage, they wouldn't send themselves to their deaths.

"Has the Immortal Battle Marquis sent down a council token?"

"Not yet."

The Fate Emperor shook his head, "Recently, there have been no major wars in the myriad realms, and the passage's fluctuations are not obvious. The Immortal Battle Marquis would find it difficult to locate the passage unless more immortal experts in the Lower Realm die. If two or three Eternal Realm immortals were to die, given the current situation, he might be able to sense the passage."

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "Then let's forget about it."

Invade the Immortal Realm to kill Eternals? Forget it!

As they chatted, the Fate Emperor's expression suddenly shifted, and Wan Tiansheng's eyes also changed, quickly disappearing from the spot.

In the void, a passage faintly appeared, as if it was about to open!

At this moment, the Fate Emperor's expression changed. What was happening? Why was there a change in the passage out of nowhere? Could it be that the three major races were up to something again, dispersing the power of laws? But there hadn't been any prior signs!

His expression fluctuated as he awaited changes from the Upper Realm. Was someone about to descend? Or was it just a simple probe without descending?

As he pondered, suddenly, above the passage, a face faintly appeared. It wasn't very clear, but it roughly resembled a human face.

The Fate Emperor looked up, unable to sense the other party's aura across the realm. He was puzzled—who was this expert from which race? A human face? It could only be one of the three major races. Normally, other races would project their true forms.

"Wuming, are you there?"

"Calling Wuming!"

"..."

The Fate Emperor was momentarily dazed. What was going on? Were they looking for him? Who was this? Why did that faint willpower fluctuation seem somewhat familiar?

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng, who had just hidden, also appeared, with a hint of surprise. This face... seemed a bit familiar.

"Is anyone there? Can someone respond? It's too vague from up here. Is anyone there? Wuming, give me a reply! Quickly!"

"..."

The Fate Emperor's eyes grew increasingly strange, and Wan Tiansheng was equally bewildered. He quickly transmitted, "Connect your willpower! The interference within the passage is too great; he seems unable to detect us."

The Fate Emperor said no more, quickly connecting his willpower.

As soon as he connected, in the Upper Realm, Su Yu sensed it and was overjoyed, "Fate Emperor, it's me!"

...

In the Lower Realm, the Fate Emperor's mouth opened slightly. Damn! Su Yu? Did you conquer the Upper Realm? Otherwise, how could you appear at the Upper Realm passage!

He was a bit dazed. Was this era really so terrifying? Hadn't Su Yu just left a few days ago? He knew Su Yu had left because Su Yu had taken the River of Time and had sought some tokens from the Fate Emperor to seek cooperation with the Fate Clan in the Upper Realm.

At this moment, the Fate Emperor was momentarily stunned and transmitted, "Your Excellency... who might you be?"

He pretended not to understand. Could it be a test from the Upper Realm? It was possible! After all, the sensing was too weak across realms, and at this moment, Su Yu quickly said, "Cut the nonsense. Last time, you drew a map of the Great Dao for me!"

"..."

Understood! It really was Su Yu! The Fate Emperor, shocked, was also speechless. How did this person end up above the passage? He looked at Wan Tiansheng, revealing a wry smile, "It's... Emperor Yu."

Wan Tiansheng exhaled, laughing, "I thought that face looked familiar. It really is him!"

What a surprise!

Quickly, Wan Tiansheng also connected his willpower, "It's me, Wan Tiansheng!"

...

In the Upper Realm, Su Yu was also surprised, then delighted. Old Wan was here too. It seemed he was quite responsible. Su Yu didn't waste words, quickly saying, "Go to the Human Realm and find the Heavenly Casting King. Have him quickly send up the remaining pages of my Mark of Civilization. The Upper Realm is full of treasures, full of the power of laws, all ownerless. I need these things!"

Su Yu regretted not bringing some blank pages when he ascended. Now, his Mark of Civilization only had a few pages of gods, demons, and immortals. I need many pages, all blank. I'm going to steal the Human Emperor's power of the Great Dao!

"Send it up?"

Wan Tiansheng hesitated. This... wasn't easy to send!

Su Yu, of course, knew this and quickly said, "No problem, hurry up. I'll temporarily suppress the passage for a short time. It's not possible for long, but if you're quick, it can be done! Send it to me immediately..."

"Alright!"

Wan Tiansheng didn't say much. Su Yu said the Upper Realm was full of treasures. Well, if he said so, I'll believe it. People have descended from the Upper Realm before, and they didn't say it was full of treasures.

At this moment, Su Yu quickly added, "The time flow between the Upper and Lower Realms should be the same. Hurry up, I'll come back in an hour, open it on time. The repulsive force is too strong; I can't speak for long..."

"Got it!"

With a rumble, the passage closed, and Su Yu's large face disappeared.

The Fate Emperor was visibly shaken, "This... can things be sent up?"

Wan Tiansheng shrugged.

The Fate Emperor was indeed a bit dazed. Su Yu was treating the Upper Realm like his own home? Doing whatever he pleased? What was the situation in the Upper Realm now? Wasn't this passage in the Land of Dao Source? The Land of Dao Source should be under the control of the myriad races now, right? How did Su Yu manage to reach this side of the passage?

Wan Tiansheng didn't dwell on it. Su Yu wanted something, and he wanted it quickly. He had to fetch it, swiftly traversing the void, hurrying towards the Human Realm!

Not only did he need to fetch the items, but Wan Tiansheng was also contemplating something. If Su Yu could open the Upper Realm passage, did it mean he could also bring people up? From the Fate Realm, bring people up? Or bring people down? Of course, taking another passage was also possible, but if they used the Fate Realm, any strong enemies chasing them down would be suppressed, offering a chance for a swift kill.

Countless thoughts flashed through Wan Tiansheng's mind. He quickly returned to the Human Realm, flying towards the Heavenly Casting King and the others.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was slightly panting. He couldn't communicate for long; the repulsive force was too strong. No wonder the Immortal Battle Marquis had to retreat after communicating for a while last time. The sensing was very weak, and it was normal for the Immortal Battle Marquis, that big fool, not to realize he was being impersonated.

"The Mark of Civilization still lacks many pages. If I bring some up and fill them with the power of the attributes at the end of the Human Emperor's Great Dao, my pages will quickly grow stronger!"

Su Yu was somewhat expectant. The things left by the Human Emperor were all treasures! He didn't linger any longer, quickly leaving. Taking advantage of this time, he would make another trip to the junction to contact the Time Great Dao, enhance his pen dao, and once he obtained the pages of the Mark of Civilization, his exploration of the Land of Dao Source would be nearly complete.

"I know the location of Hundred Battle's seal. I've found the entrance to the Lower Realm. I've discovered the core of the Human Emperor's Great Dao. I've uncovered the true nature of the pseudo-dao..."

In this brief journey along the Human Emperor's Great Dao, Su Yu had gained immensely. Although his strength hadn't increased much, it was only a matter of time.

Quickly, Su Yu headed towards the end of the Great Dao. Moments later, he witnessed a terrifying scene. At the end, it was as if a dam had burst, a massive breach appeared, like a celestial river surging, countless waters rushing in.

Rumble!

The river roared incessantly.

"Heavenly River Mouth..."

Su Yu recalled the information he had received earlier. This place was once called the Heavenly River Mouth. How fitting! This was the mouth of the celestial river, collapsed, with river waters surging down.

Su Yu avoided the impact of those river waters.

"The Human Emperor is ruthless!"

Su Yu muttered. The master of the Death Path had also opened a breach, but it seemed they hadn't stolen as much power. The master of the Death Path had only stolen a large amount of death energy. The Human Emperor, on the other hand, had dug a massive pit!

"One is more ruthless than the other!"

If the Time Great Dao truly had a master, encountering these two thieves would probably make them cry.

At this moment, Su Yu also sensed the power of the pen dao, a very distinct power of the pen dao. Clearly, this was the true range of the Time Great Dao.

Rumble!

Accompanied by the roaring river, Su Yu sat cross-legged in a place untouched by the river's impact, beginning to comprehend the power of the pen dao. Here, the comprehension was faster and more distinct.

Su Yu's journey to the Upper Realm had been fruitful, especially with the abundant power of laws at his disposal. He had gained profound insights, and perhaps he could advance further. Currently, he possessed the combat strength of a second-tier Daofuse cultivator. If he could progress even more, he wondered if he might reach the realm of a Heavenly King.

Setting aside these thoughts, Su Yu focused on comprehending the Great Dao. A sense of enlightenment flowed along the river, extending into the true River of Time.

The comprehension of the Great Dao!

...

Within the pen dao.

Previously, Su Yu had covered approximately 75% of the area. Now, with the power of his Great Dao comprehension, the area he covered began to expand. The expansion wasn't as rapid as before, but it was genuine and continuous, integrating with the dao.

76%, 77%...

Gradually, the area Su Yu covered approached 80%. According to his own estimation, reaching around 80% might grant him the combat strength of a Heavenly King.

It was unclear how much time had passed.

With a thunderous roar!

Su Yu's Great Dao surged forward, breaking through a boundary, surpassing 80%, and continuing to expand slightly before all his insights faded away.

...

At the same time.

In the land of endless darkness.

A white-robed expert turned his head again, somewhat dazed.

Damn!

Why did it feel like in the blink of an eye, the guy who inherited the pen dao seemed to have gained new insights?

What was going on?

Was the time flow here vastly different from that of the Myriad Realms?

Could it be that in the blink of an eye, hundreds or thousands of years had passed?

That couldn't be!

If that were true, wouldn't millions or tens of millions of years have passed in the Myriad Realms?

"That can't be right..."

"If that were true... so many years... it's impossible... it can't be..."

The white-robed expert was somewhat shaken. It couldn't have been that long!

Millions of years would have seen countless changes in the world.

"If that were true, the Martial Emperor would have long perished, dying of old age. I think he's still alive..."
