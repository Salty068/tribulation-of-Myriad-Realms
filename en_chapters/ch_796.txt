Chapter 796: The Expedition (Requesting Subscriptions)

Indeed, the grand play had begun.

That night, atop Ren Mountain, several Heavenly Sovereigns were visibly displeased. Su Yu had requested that they all don ancient ceremonial attire the next day to see him off on his expedition. While granting Su Yu some benefits wasn't a big deal, this particular request was hard to swallow.

Some vehemently opposed it, while others agreed. Heavendoom was indifferent, saying, "It's a trivial matter. If he wants to go to war, let him. It’s just for show, to satisfy his vanity. Isn't it a good thing if he fights?"

After all, it cost them nothing.

However, Dao Heavenly Sovereign coldly retorted, "Impossible! What nonsense is this? We've resisted the Human Race for countless years. Now, to see him off as if we were ancient ministers, isn't that akin to submitting again? Wouldn't that make our resistance over the past hundred thousand years a joke?"

"And to wear ancient ceremonial attire? Absolutely not!"

The Heavenly Sovereigns argued incessantly over this matter. Some were vocal, while others remained silent. Thunderstorm and Destiny were among those who stayed quiet, with Thunderstorm barely speaking since delivering the initial message. His mind was still preoccupied with thoughts of Su Yu.

Su Yu was indeed a formidable individual. He could trace even the most obscure clues to their source, making him increasingly awe-inspiring. Thunderstorm pondered the comparison between Hundred Battle and Su Yu. Who was truly stronger?

Evaluating them wasn't just about strength. After much thought, he couldn't reach a conclusion, but he felt that Su Yu exerted more pressure on him, perhaps because Hundred Battle was more low-key.

...

Regardless of the commotion, Su Yu paid it no mind. At that moment, he was instructing March to gather all the Iron Devourer Race members to prevent them from retaliating against the Dragon Heavenly Sovereign once they left. Only Marquis Giant Bamboo remained outside, while April and May were instructed by Su Yu to temporarily retreat into the weapon space.

Su Yu, Fat Ball, March, Giant Axe, Xuelan, Tongtian, and Giant Bamboo—four Heavenly Sovereigns and three Heavenly Kings—comprised Su Yu's chosen force. They were all top-tier beings. In this era, even Heavenly Kings weren't easily killed by Heavenly Sovereigns.

The Iron Devourer Race was relocating once more. March handed over the weapon space containing the Iron Devourer Race to Su Yu.

March grinned, "It's safer with Your Majesty than with me."

Su Yu glanced at him. Safe? Not necessarily! Without further comment, he accepted the weapon space and said, "This time, we might encounter formidable enemies, possibly even newly emerged rulers of laws! So, everyone must be cautious!"

He continued solemnly, "As always, follow orders! At critical moments, no matter what I say, obeying orders is your best chance for survival! If you don't, any fall will be your own doing!"

This time, there were no dissenters; everyone nodded in agreement.

After some consideration, Su Yu added, "The Sin Race might not have only five Heavenly Sovereigns. Be aware of this! The intelligence system of the myriad races is garbage; they never get first-hand information!"

The group chuckled, and Giant Axe laughed, "Isn't that a good thing? If they had all the intelligence, it would be troublesome."

Su Yu smiled and nodded slightly.

Then, he transmitted a message, "Remember, aim to severely injure, not kill! Killing often comes at a great cost!"

The group was surprised. Wasn't Su Yu's goal to kill a few strong enemies?

"Killing... wait until we're in my world to do that!"

Su Yu explained quickly to prevent any reckless actions, "Injure them, break some of them, and... ideally, force some to flee into the depths of chaos!"

"Let them find our world themselves, rather than the world revealing itself!"

In short, Su Yu wanted everything to appear seamless. Any opportunities, worlds, or tea plants weren't gifts from him but were discovered through their own hard work and incredible luck.

The group nodded again, ready to follow Su Yu's plan.

"Blue Sky!"

Su Yu spoke again, "The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon might not act immediately, and... we can't fully trust them! They claim they want to kill that ruler of laws, but it might not be true! They could join forces with the enemy! If the Eight-Winged Tiger allies with them, inform Director Wan and the others to retreat immediately, even if they see an opportunity!"

Su Yu wouldn't fully trust these two Chaos Ancient Beasts, trusting them only three parts out of ten. Besides his own people, Su Yu trusted no one! In these times, blindly trusting others was a path to death. Everyone was cunning and deceitful.

After a pause, Su Yu continued, "At critical moments, if a crisis arises, everyone in the world should follow the orders of... the Great Zhou King!"

Upon hearing this, even the bracelet transformed by Blue Sky was stunned, not to mention March and the others. In Su Yu's camp, the top-tier experts he trusted most were Blue Sky, Wan Tiansheng, Fat Ball, South King, and Lanshan... all ranked above the Great Zhou King!

In terms of strength, the Great Zhou King wasn't even a Heavenly Sovereign, unlike South King and the others. He wasn't even as strong as Wan Tiansheng!

Yet, Su Yu declared that in critical moments, they should follow the Great Zhou King's orders.

Why?

Everyone was puzzled!

Su Yu didn't explain. Just listen.

The Great Zhou King? A mysterious old fellow, once the Human Emperor's scribe, knew too much, held too much. Hundred Battle's son was a top secret, right? The Great Zhou King knew!

Not only did he know, but he casually gossiped about it, without any intention of keeping it secret. For six thousand years, the myriad races had been unaware of this situation. The Giant Race hid it well, yet Su Yu and the others heard it as a joke, thanks to the Great Zhou King. Otherwise, who would have known?

This matter was a secret! Yet, the Great Zhou King didn't treat it as one.

As the Human Emperor's scribe, Su Yu hadn't thought deeply about it before. Now, seeing Hundred Battle and the others being secretive, he realized that the Great Zhou King might have deliberately leaked information. The key was that this old fellow often spoke without being thorough!

He praised Hundred Battle as a capable man, loyal and righteous, victorious in every battle, with extraordinary talent... while Su Yu was still cursing Hundred Battle as a waste.

The Great Zhou King, intentionally or unintentionally, had leaked many secrets to Su Yu. Sometimes, Su Yu just hadn't paid attention.

"Including strength!"

Su Yu muttered. He hadn't helped the Great Zhou King much, yet the Great Zhou King's strength never lagged behind. When everyone was Eternal, he was Eternal. When everyone reached Daofuse, he reached Daofuse. When everyone became Heavenly Kings, he became a Heavenly King. Not the strongest, but always useful and never overlooked.

Su Yu mentioned visiting the Human Emperor's Great Dao, and the Great Zhou King knew about it. Su Yu discovered the Soul Burying Mountain passage, and the Great Zhou King immediately followed up, claiming he knew about it too.

In short, regarding the Great Zhou King, Su Yu felt he might have some hidden cards. Not necessarily too strong, but perhaps capable of triggering another tidal change at a critical moment. If the ninth tide ended and the tenth began, and if the Human Emperor hadn't returned, would there be an eleventh?

...

While Su Yu pondered, within his cosmic world, underground, Blue Sky relayed Su Yu's orders. At that moment, everyone looked at the Great Zhou King, who would take charge in critical moments.

All eyes were on the Great Zhou King.

Even Wan Tiansheng and the others smiled at him.

The Great Zhou King looked awkward, "Well... Director Wan, I have no idea what His Majesty is thinking. How can such a heavy responsibility be entrusted to me? I'm weak. I think Director Wan should take charge!"

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "His Majesty's word is final. Why be modest, Great Zhou King? In terms of scheming, I'm certainly no match for you!"

"That's not true..."

Wan Tiansheng interrupted with a smile, "Isn't it? I've been lying low in the academy for years, waiting for the right moment, yet everything has been under your control! Outsiders thought I was just Shanhai, but you never did!"

With a sigh, Wan Tiansheng continued, "I just want to ask one thing... Great Zhou King, do you mind chatting with me?"

The Great Zhou King raised an eyebrow and quickly smiled, "Of course!"

"Please!"

Wan Tiansheng led the way, and the Great Zhou King soon followed.

Away from the others, the Great Zhou King smiled, "What do you want to ask, Director Wan? I'll tell you everything I know..."

Wan Tiansheng turned to him, calmly asking, "Not much, just one question. Does my Senior Brother Ye have any connection with you?"

"..."

The Great Zhou King looked puzzled, "Ye Batian? No connection with me..."

"Really?"

Wan Tiansheng smiled faintly, "Then let me ask a few more questions! Xia Chen only emerged with the Culture King's inheritance during this tide, right?"

"Yes."

"Why didn't he appear in the previous nine tides?"

Wan Tiansheng asked seriously, "In this tide, Xia Chen appeared with the Culture King's inheritance! Not only that, but too many things have appeared in this tide! The Ink Dao appeared, inherited by Liu Hong! The Pen Dao was inherited by His Majesty! The Inkstone Dao... the Culture King's Residence, also appeared in this tide! The Paper Dao, too!"

"The Culture King's four Daos all appeared in this tide!"

"The Martial Emperor awoke in this tide!"

"Then, the Starry Sky Seal emerged. Otherwise, without the opening of the Culture King's Residence, where would we find the Starry Sky Seal?"

"The Culture King's legacy, the Human Emperor's legacy—these are likely the greatest contingencies left for humanity after the ancient retreat. This time, both have appeared, not during the era of the Hundred Battle King!"

"Nine is the extreme! During the Hundred Battle King's era, logically, with his talent, he should have obtained these. Yet, it wasn't him. Perhaps, during that period, someone considered bringing these things forth, but when they realized the true intentions of the Hundred Battle King, when they discovered the Torchbearer lineage was in crisis, being squeezed out and even secretly harmed... they chose to initiate the tenth tide!"

Wan Tiansheng looked at the Great Zhou King and said calmly, "These things, I actually don't care about. I just want to know about Senior Brother Ye!"

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "Senior Brother Ye played a significant role in this series of changes! Although his strength now seems weak, because of Senior Brother Ye... the whole world knows that the multi-divine character faction is actually very powerful! Before Senior Brother Ye, neither the first generation Xia Chen nor the third generation Nan Wujian had as much fame. The multi-divine character faction wasn't well-known at the start!"

"After Senior Brother Ye's rise, and even after his death, the multi-divine character faction became a place that the myriad races feared, a place that only recruited top-tier geniuses!"

"The Great Zhou Prefecture, whether intentionally or unintentionally, has been suppressing the multi-divine character faction, constantly putting it in a life-and-death crisis!"

"Thus... His Majesty appeared!"

Wan Tiansheng said calmly, "Otherwise, even if His Majesty inherited the Book of Time from the Time Sage, if the situation wasn't so urgent, many wars wouldn't have erupted prematurely. If he had joined the single divine character faction... the entire Myriad Realms would be at peace now!"

"But how long can peace last? The Human Emperor and others want to return soon. If someone senses this and panics, realizing there's no time, will they trigger a series of changes prematurely?"

Wan Tiansheng looked at the Great Zhou King again and asked, "Afterwards, I searched several times in the Celestial River of Death, but I never found my senior brother!"

He looked at the Great Zhou King, "Great Zhou King, do you know where my senior brother went?"

The Great Zhou King frowned, "Ye Batian is dead. Maybe he hasn't revived, maybe he's still in the Celestial River of Death, maybe he hasn't regained his memory. He wasn't strong in life; isn't that normal?"

Wan Tiansheng nodded slightly, "Then let me ask you again, whose person is Liu Hong?"

"Hmm?"

The Great Zhou King looked at him, and Wan Tiansheng said calmly, "No, or rather, who arranged for Liu Hong to inherit the Ink Dao? Liu Hong actually knows a lot, but some things, he may not have lied about. He might have suddenly gained some insights, or even seen some memories... He said he saw it from the Great Dao. Can the Great Dao show these things?"

"Liu Hong said, 'Divine characters are rules!' Because of this, His Majesty and I understood many things. Just this one sentence, an ordinary Daofuse expert can't see through it!"

"And Liu Hong inheriting the Ink Dao, is it also a preparation for reviving someone?"

Wan Tiansheng looked at the Great Zhou King, "And reviving Xingyue, is it because she mastered the Dao of Life, and someone thought she was needed at the front line to support the Human Emperor and others?"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Tiansheng, you're overthinking it!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Not at all, not at all! Then let me ask you, do you not know Xingyue?"

"I don't know!"

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "I only followed His Majesty the Human Emperor at the end of the Human Realm. Xingyue died too early, and later, His Majesty never mentioned these things again, so naturally, I don't know about them!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Is that so? Fine, say what you will!"

Wan Tiansheng had actually mostly figured out some of the Great Zhou King's plans.

Perhaps, during the ninth tide, he was prepared to take action, to help the Hundred Battle King suppress the myriad races, and thus greet the return of the Human Emperor and others in the strongest posture, or even actively assist the Human Emperor.

However, soon, the Great Zhou King realized something was wrong!

Figures like Bingku and Danyu were clearly arranged by the Great Zhou King, but unfortunately, the Hundred Battle King seemed to have set them up, forcing the Great Zhou King to lie low, suppressing everything he had originally prepared to expose!

He must know where the Culture King's legacy is, and he must know that the Battle King's lineage is guarding the Culture Tomb.

Yet, he never brought it out.

The Hundred Battle King suddenly revived the Human Ancestor's bloodline and began to lean towards the Human Ancestor. The pursuits of the Human Ancestor and the Human Emperor might not be the same, leading to some conflicts.

Thus, the tenth tide came, with only one controller, the Great Zhou King!

From beginning to end, it was!

Whether it's the Great Qin King or Su Yu, they were all pushed to the top by the Great Zhou King.

The matter of Ye Batian was a huge turning point for the multi-divine character faction. Wan Tiansheng didn't believe that such a big matter could be ignored by the Great Zhou King.

The multi-divine character faction is the Culture King's legacy. Others might know, but the Great Zhou King doesn't?

It's normal for the Human Race not to know!

Yet, even Heavendoom knows that the Culture Tomb is actually left by the Culture King. Would the Great Zhou King be completely ignorant?

Impossible!

However, the Culture Tomb was placed in the Cultural Research Academy for 50 years. Even after Ye Batian died, even when the multi-divine character faction of the Cultural Research Academy was in decline, this powerful figure who knew what the Culture Tomb was never came to take it.

Does the Great Zhou King not care about the pen dao?

Even if he doesn't know it's the pen dao, doesn't he know it might involve the Culture King's legacy?

Yet, he never touched the Culture Tomb.

If he had taken the Culture Tomb early on, none of this would have happened!

Su Yu wouldn't have learned the multi-divine character combat skills, wouldn't have come into contact with the pen dao. Without the pen dao, the pen dao's multi-divine characters might seem insignificant now, but in reality, they are the key to Su Yu's opening of the heavens.

99 divine characters are the foundation for opening the heavens.

Countless thoughts flashed through Wan Tiansheng's mind. Soon, Wan Tiansheng no longer dwelled on it, "Great Zhou King, regardless, the Human Race has what it has today, and you should take great credit! Since His Majesty believes you can handle the crisis, I hope that if there are troubles ahead, the Great Zhou King will pay more attention. The Human Race... or rather, the Human Emperor and others, can't wait for the next Human Lord!"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Of course!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded slightly and quickly said, "Then, Great Zhou King, when can you reach the Heavenly Sovereign level?"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "Hard to say, depends on luck!"

Wan Tiansheng frowned slightly, "Next time then! Next time, when someone advances to Heavenly Sovereign, or when either I or Lantian reaches Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Zhou King should also reach Heavenly Sovereign!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King was speechless!

This statement made it sound like reaching Heavenly Sovereign was easy.

Wan Tiansheng continued, "The little Hundred Battle that His Majesty mentioned, and some of His Majesty's speculations, do you think they have any merit?"

"There's some truth to it!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "Actually, I'm not too sure about these things, but... the Hundred Battle King's son is indeed quite mysterious. Even I haven't actually met him."

The Great Zhou King had collaborated with the Giant Race.

Wan Tiansheng nodded, taking it as confirmation from the Great Zhou King, and continued, "Do you think the other side is aware of our existence now? If he's in chaos, with the recent changes in chaos, including His Majesty's opening of the heavens, is he hiding in the shadows, watching us?"

The Great Zhou King raised an eyebrow, "Hard to say, maybe he knows, maybe he doesn't!"

"Then all of His Majesty's trump cards are exposed to the Hundred Battle King!"

Wan Tiansheng's eyes were deep, "Great Zhou King, if the other side is really strong, even reaching the level of the Martial Emperor... do you think we can handle it?"

The Martial Emperor is very strong!

Of course, the currently sealed Martial Emperor is not worth mentioning.

Speaking of the Martial Emperor, Wan Tiansheng laughed again, "The Martial Emperor has been sealed for many years, only recently showing signs of revival, and it just so happened to be encountered by His Majesty, what a coincidence! Opening 360 acupoints to hear some voices... before His Majesty, was there no one in the entire Human Race who opened 360 acupoints? If I'm not mistaken, the Hundred Battle King also opened them, he should have been to the Luminous Domain Mansion, why didn't he hear any voices?"

"This..."

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and said, "Maybe the Martial Emperor's will only revived in recent years, before that, maybe it was completely dormant!"

"Alright!"

Wan Tiansheng actually wanted to tear off his old face to see if he would blush, but thinking about it, he let it go.

Su Yu didn't pursue it to the end, so he wouldn't either.

However, the two exchanged a glance, both showing some smiles, smiling somewhat kindly, as if both understood, as if both were saying, you're not a good person!

...

Su Yu didn't know any of this.

Of course, he knew that he had handed over great power to the Great Zhou King, and Wan Tiansheng and the others would be attentive, not allowing the Great Zhou King to act recklessly.

At this moment, the sky was gradually brightening.

Su Yu didn't say much, stepping into the air, heading straight for the Ren Mountain area.

To seize the Dragon Heavenly Sovereign!

...

Over at Ren Mountain.

At this moment, a group of powerful figures was also beginning to descend the mountain.

Of course, they didn't follow Su Yu's suggestion to wear ancient attire. That would be too humiliating. The myriad races didn't want others to mistakenly believe that they were once again submitting to the Human Race because of this.

Soon, the two sides faced each other from a distance.

The distance was getting closer and closer.

Leading the way this time was the Saint Marquis of the Immortal Race.

This time, all the major powerhouses were present.

There were many Heavenly Sovereigns!

Including the newly promoted Heavenly Sovereign, the Origin Saint Marquis, who was also present.

The Immortal Race remained as strong as ever.

Saint Marquis, Dao Heavenly Sovereign, Desolate Heavenly Sovereign, Origin Saint Marquis, a total of four Heavenly Sovereign-level powerhouses.

And on the side of the God Race, there were also the Former Empress, Sun Corona Heavenly Sovereign, and Moon Heavenly Sovereign.

As for the Demon Race, there were only two Heavenly Sovereigns at the moment, Mo Heavenly Sovereign and Demon Heaven.

Mo Heaven and Mo Heavenly Sovereign sound similar in the Human Race language, but in the Demon Race language, there's actually a big difference.

Just these three races alone had nine Heavenly Sovereigns appearing at this moment.

Others, like the Nether Heavenly Sovereign, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, Phoenix Heavenly Sovereign, Thunderstorm, and Destiny, a total of fourteen top-tier powerhouses, were all present at this moment.

The two sides quickly closed the distance to less than a kilometer.

March and his companions were on high alert, wary of being ambushed. Who knew if these people would suddenly turn on them? With fourteen top-tier experts and a group of Heavenly Kings, even though their side was strong, they were still outmatched.

...

The two sides met.

As soon as they did, Su Yu frowned and said, "What, I act as your vanguard, and you can't even meet a small request of mine?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable was the first to speak, smiling, "Human Lord Su, this was brought up on short notice, and we didn't have time to prepare! These ancient uniforms were long destroyed. To suddenly request them, we need time to prepare... We also need to find some of the elders who studied these things back in the day to recreate them. These aren't things that can be made casually! If they're poorly made, it would be even more embarrassing!"

Su Yu narrowed his eyes. This guy sure knew how to talk.

Su Yu said indifferently, "Forget it, I can't be bothered to argue with you! This time, I'll be the vanguard, but when will the Myriad Races deploy? Don't wait until I'm surrounded and killed, and you all haven't even shown up!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable laughed again, "We certainly won't just stand by! We'll escort the Human Lord to the vicinity of the Chaos River. This time, as long as your side can draw away two Heavenly Venerables, we'll immediately take action to flatten the Sin Clan's territory!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable continued, "This is also for a more beneficial cooperation for everyone. Otherwise, if we both engage in battle, we won't trust each other and will worry about mutual constraints!"

That was indeed the truth!

Su Yu nodded, "And if the other side's ruler of laws suddenly appears..."

Moon Heavenly Venerable smiled, "If they appear, we'll fight this time too! If the Human Lord's side can spare the effort to deal with that ruler of laws, that would be best. If not... we'll join forces to deal with them, which is also necessary!"

Su Yu nodded, looking towards the depths of Chaos Mountain, taking a deep breath, "The other side might already be waiting for us. I think this time, the Sin Clan will also come out in full force. It won't be that simple!"

Everyone nodded. This time was indeed not simple, and many experts might die.

This was also why everyone hoped Su Yu's side would be the vanguard.

The first wave, the Control King's lineage would certainly resist fiercely.

Previously, Su Yu had severely injured Yue Hao, catching them off guard. But this time, there would be no such opportunity.

This was going to be a tough battle!

Su Yu glanced at everyone. Dragon Heavenly Venerable was indeed on one side, not far from Thunderstorm, who seemed to be saying something to him, but was a bit distant from the other Heavenly Venerables.

First, grab Dragon Heavenly Venerable. The key was, his weapon might not appear. If it didn't, they'd have to beat him more.

Moreover, this mountain of dung was probably quite important to Hongmeng.

It would be best to get it in his own hands!

At this moment, Su Yu smiled, "Then let's enter Chaos Mountain together. You guys promised to send me off with imperial honors, but none of you seem to care. I'm quite disappointed!"

With that, he took the lead and walked forward, transmitting to Tongtian, "In a moment, teleport us next to Dragon Heavenly Venerable!"

"Got it!"

Tongtian responded.

Among the crowd, Tiangu and his group followed. Tiangu was also watching Su Yu. This time, Su Yu didn't lose his temper and obediently went to be the vanguard, which actually made him a bit uneasy.

Su Yu wasn't the type to not cause trouble, which made Tiangu feel uncomfortable, as if this wasn't Su Yu's style.

Tiangu felt a bit awkward.

He thought he might be overthinking.

Su Yu's target was the Control King's lineage, and causing trouble now wouldn't benefit him.

The group continued forward.

So many experts, even the ancient beasts on the outskirts of Chaos Mountain, retreated one after another.

The aura of the group shook the heavens and earth.

In the depths of Chaos Mountain, a nation surrounded by mountains was also filled with solemn experts, ready for battle.

The voice of the old ancestor echoed among the mountains, "The Myriad Races and Su Yu's group already know our purpose, their thieving hearts are not dead! Our Holy Clan has been dormant for countless ages. As long as we capture these people, the entire Myriad Realms will be under our control!"

"Patiently await the opening of the Gate of Hell, await the return of the ancestors... The path of the Holy Clan will surely illuminate the Myriad Realms, turning all heavens into the Holy Clan's dojo!"

The old ancestor's voice continued to echo among the mountains, cold and stern, "Now, we are in the process of welcoming back Supreme Prison Green! Supreme Prison Green is truly one who has attained the Dao of Chaos, mastering the will of chaos!"

"As long as Supreme Prison Green returns, all obstacles will turn to dust!"

"......"

The old ancestor was also inspiring morale, speaking in a low voice, "Our Holy Clan is not inferior to the Myriad Races, but our goal is to defeat the Myriad Races while preserving strong combat power, not to suffer heavy losses!"

This was also the thought of all races, to fight to mutual destruction was not a big problem.

But no one wanted that.

At this moment, a group of experts below was invigorated, "We will do our utmost!"

The old ancestor nodded, shouting, "Then keep the enemy outside, don't let them interfere with our welcoming of Supreme Prison Green!"

In an instant, four Heavenly Venerable auras and more than ten Heavenly King auras emerged. Behind them, dozens of top-tier Daofuse experts flew towards the outside of the mountain.

Except for the heavily injured Yue Hao, the known Heavenly Venerables of the Myriad Races, including Moon Luo, all set out.

The old ancestor of the Control King's lineage did not go out.

His voice echoed, but he remained deep within the mountains.

Right before the Gate of Hell!

Waiting for his senior sister to return!

And behind the Gate of Hell, pairs of eyes appeared. Among them, one pair of eyes, filled with wisdom, cast a glance at the old ancestor, a voice faintly coming through, "Yue Zhan, how much longer until completion?"

Outside the gate, the old ancestor of the Control King's lineage, Yue Zhan, said solemnly, "Very soon... If the Myriad Races don't interfere, at most three hours, and we can welcome Senior Sister back!"

Behind the gate, the eyes carried some anger, "The news leaked... too early!"

It was just at this moment!

She was very dissatisfied!

Yue Zhan had nothing to say, it was indeed too coincidental, so much so that he suspected if someone in the clan had leaked the information.

Did Su Yu really learn about it from the projection of the Gate of Hell?

But now was not the time to investigate.

...

At the same time.

Su Yu's group had already arrived near the Chaos River.

On both sides, some ancient beast experts were vaguely peering over.

Su Yu glanced around and smiled, "Then send us off here. I can already sense the other side's aura rising. It seems they're eagerly waiting for me. Everyone, be sure to rescue us in time... Otherwise, if we can't win, we'll definitely run!"

With that, Su Yu laughed, "Or... why don't we all charge in together? This way, I feel it's safer. It feels a bit like a piecemeal tactic!"

At this moment, behind him, Dragon Heavenly Venerable casually added, "Since the Human Lord took our things, it's more appropriate to first test the other side's situation..."

He was just saying it casually.

But Su Yu was waiting to find fault with him!

The next moment, before the others could react, Su Yu suddenly shouted, "How dare you question me? Kill!"

Boom!

Su Yu's group instantly appeared in front of Dragon Heavenly Venerable.

Everyone was stunned!

Their heads buzzed!

What the hell?

Weren't you going to war?

Damn!

Why did you suddenly turn hostile?

Even the former consort and others were stunned, and after the shock came anger. The Holy Marquis shouted angrily, and together with several others, attacked Su Yu's group!

Damn it!

What the hell is this guy doing?

At this moment, Tiangu's face changed slightly, and the next moment, as if he thought of something, he shouted, "Don't..."

Turning hostile and fighting now was not a good thing.

But Su Yu's group all attacked, targeting the still-dazed Dragon Heavenly Venerable.

Dragon Heavenly Venerable's face also changed dramatically!

Damn!

Why?

I just said that, and this lunatic actually wants to kill me.

Four Heavenly Venerables!

Moreover, Su Yu's aura was incredibly powerful, giving him a sense of impending death.

Dragon Heavenly Venerable roared, and a huge mountain suddenly appeared in front of him. This was Dragon Coiling Mountain, a peculiar mountain like a giant turtle carrying a dragon.

Once crafted, it was an incredibly powerful weapon.

At this moment, Dragon Heavenly Venerable couldn't care about anything else, defending, blocking them!

Otherwise, he would die!

As he took out the mountain, he wanted to escape, but at that moment, his scalp suddenly tingled!

Danger from behind!

He had originally wanted to retreat, but he stopped instantly, his hair standing on end. There was danger behind him!

Thunderstorm!

Yes, it was that bastard Thunderstorm, damn it, he was in cahoots with Su Yu and the others!

These people were all crazy!

Boom!

As he thought of this, four powerful figures attacked simultaneously. The other three attacked Dragon Heavenly Venerable, while Fat Ball opened its mouth wide and swallowed the giant mountain whole!

Boom!

With a loud noise, Su Yu and the other three, each with a punch, sent Dragon Heavenly Venerable flying millions of meters, spitting blood, his body riddled with holes.

Su Yu instantly transformed his fist into a blade, slashing at Dragon Heavenly Venerable, accompanied by a powerful will, "Release control of Dragon Coiling Mountain, or you will die!"

As Dragon Heavenly Venerable flew back, he saw the blade before him!

Filled with terror and despair, the next moment, with a last glimmer of hope, he roared, spitting a mouthful of blood, releasing control over Dragon Coiling Mountain.

"Retreat!"

Su Yu shouted lowly, and in an instant, the group disappeared in front of Dragon Heavenly Venerable.

At this moment, the Holy Marquis and others' killing moves arrived, exploding the heavens and earth with a rumble!

And Su Yu's voice echoed, "Just kidding, you took it seriously? We're off to kill, kill the Sin Clan's guys!"

The Holy Marquis and others turned to see Su Yu and his group, howling, charging into the depths of Chaos Mountain!

Some wanted to chase, but quickly stopped. Then, one by one, they looked at each other, their eyes filled with strange expressions.

Some were angry, some were helpless.

What... to do?

Do they really have to chase and kill Su Yu's group?

Dragon Heavenly Sovereign was coughing up blood in large gulps, his expression tinged with confusion. In the next moment, as if realizing something, he roared in fury, "Thunderstorm!"

Su Yu and his companions had fled, off to slay their enemies. Was he supposed to chase after them?

At this moment, all his rage was directed entirely at Thunderstorm!

Scoundrel!

Thunderstorm had just intimidated him!

Meanwhile, Thunderstorm sighed inwardly. I knew trouble would come. Oh well, it's still less troublesome than dealing with Su Yu!
