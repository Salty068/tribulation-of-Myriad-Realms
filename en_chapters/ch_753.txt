Chapter 753: Evacuation

Today, Su Yu was in an inexplicably good mood, a feeling no one else could truly understand. Whether it was the Hundred Battle King, the Chaos Race, or the Martial Emperor, they all occupied the Three Realms, and they were all humans. As long as they were humans, that was good enough. The shackles had been lifted! Unless the myriad races won, there was no longer a need to worry about the fate of humanity. None of these people, regardless of their intentions, would go so far as to exterminate ordinary humans. Even the Martial Emperor hadn't declared any intent to kill them all.

Ever since becoming the Human Lord, how could he not care about the fate of humanity, despite claiming otherwise? He had been walking on thin ice, bearing the heavy responsibility of billions of lives, where any slight misstep could lead to the extinction of his race. But today, he was liberated! He no longer needed to worry excessively. As long as the ordinary humans did not resist their rule, there would be no threat of annihilation.

Rebuilding humanity was easier said than done. With humans already existing, these people wouldn't entertain the thought of recreating humanity from scratch.

Old Turtle, now transformed into a young man, followed behind Su Yu, filled with confusion and doubt. Today's Su Yu was in a dire state, yet he seemed to have reverted to the Su Yu of old—bold and unrestrained, declaring his ambition to become the overlord of the ancient city, to dominate the realm, and to become a tyrant of the Myriad Realms. And Su Yu had achieved that! He roamed freely, killing at will, with the backing of thirty-six guardians, without any worries. He fought whenever he wanted!

Since becoming the Human Lord, Su Yu had gradually changed. He became unpredictable, capricious, and cautious. In the past, if he had gone to the Upper Realm with so many powerful beings, he wouldn't have thought twice. He would have killed anyone in his way and fled afterward, regardless of the consequences!

Su Yu, who could freely travel between the Upper and Lower Realms, was no longer burdened by the humans of the Lower Realm. Why should he care whether the realms were open or not? And if they were open, so what?

Old Turtle followed Su Yu without asking questions, deep in thought. Something must have happened in the Upper Realm that made Su Yu revert to his former self.

"Emperor Yu..."

"No need to ask, let's head to the Eastern Rift Valley first!"

Su Yu didn't give him a chance to ask questions. Ahead, someone from the human side quickly approached through the air. Tian Yue greeted him with a deep voice, "Greetings, Emperor Yu, welcome back!"

Su Yu looked at Tian Yue, smiled, and said loudly, "Tian Yue, gather all the Daofuse and Eternal experts and head to the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

"Remember, everyone, including those from the Phoenix Realm and Ape Realm!"

Tian Yue's expression changed slightly. Wasn't he going to leave some deterrence for the major realms? Was he not planning to ambush the three major races? Although he didn't understand, since Su Yu had given the order, he could only comply.

"Understood!"

Tian Yue quickly left to summon everyone for a meeting. In fact, it hadn't been long since the last Daofuse meeting.

...

Eastern Rift Valley.

The massive Luminous Domain Mansion stood here, gradually becoming a spiritual symbol for humanity. For over four hundred years, humanity had lived in fear. Although they were one of the strong races of the Myriad Realms, they were still constrained by the gods, demons, and immortals. Since the outbreak of the great war, humanity had faced the threat of extinction at any moment.

But not long after, Su Yu ascended to the top. He destroyed the Abyss, shattered the Myriad Realms, and killed dozens of so-called half-emperor experts, intimidating the three major races into closing their realms and awaiting death. Su Yu's might shook the Myriad Realms.

Since Su Yu became the Human Lord, the number of Daofuse experts under his command increased, reducing the importance of the Eternal Realm. Generally, only Daofuse experts participated in core meetings, with Eternals rarely involved.

But today, the Eternal meeting was convened once more. Various prefects and newly ascended Eternals arrived one after another.

...

Outside the Luminous Domain Mansion.

Zhu Tiandao stroked his chin, glancing at Marquis Xia, and squinted with a smile, "Xia Xiao'er, Emperor Yu returned quickly. Didn't we hear he took people to the Upper Realm? How come he's back in just a few days?"

Marquis Xia couldn't be bothered with him but couldn't resist saying a few words, transmitting his voice, "I heard... just heard, that he might have been defeated in the Upper Realm. I heard someone say they saw the Culture King's dog's tail was cut off..."

Zhu Tiandao pondered, transmitting his voice, "Our old man, yours too, haven't returned. Do you know what's going on?"

"Not really."

"I heard even Zhou Polong and those guys are coming back for this meeting. All thirty-six city guardians are returning, including the Eternals of the Iron Devourer Race. Is that true?"

"Yes!"

Xia Xiao'er nodded, transmitting his voice, "Not just them, many key military leaders, even those in the Sunmoon Realm, are returning for the meeting. Who knows how many people are coming back this time? The campaign against the Myriad Realms has been halted."

The two exchanged glances, quickly reaching a consensus. Something was up, and it was significant!

Not only the Eternals, but even some Sunmoon Realm experts were being recalled. Additionally, some prefects who hadn't ascended to the Eternal Realm were also being summoned back. This was likely the largest meeting in history.

Before this, Su Yu only needed to inform the top experts from various factions.

As they were thinking, they suddenly froze.

In the distance, dozens of people arrived. Leading them was none other than Topsoil Spirit, who wore a solemn expression. Su Yu had sent a message, calling for a meeting. The Five Elemental Race could choose to attend or not. Attending wasn't necessarily a good thing, and Su Yu promised that their absence wouldn't affect anything.

Topsoil Spirit didn't know what had happened, but after weighing the options, he decided to come. The Five Elemental Race hadn't participated in the war yet because Su Yu was waiting for the Upper and Lower Realms to open before letting them act. By then, the Five Elemental Race might be even stronger.

But now, the tacit understanding was suddenly broken. Before Topsoil Spirit could ascend, they were summoned.

Topsoil Spirit also saw Zhu Tiandao and the others, smiling as he cupped his hands, "Topsoil of the Five Elemental Race, greetings to Prefect Zhu and Marquis Xia!"

Marquis Xia was surprised, "You... why are you here?"

"Summoned by Emperor Yu!"

Topsoil Spirit chuckled, "Here to pay my respects!"

With that, he landed with his people, smiling as he approached, "Honored sirs, do you know why Emperor Yu has summoned everyone?"

Marquis Xia smiled, "Not sure, we'll find out after the meeting!"

Who knew!

As they spoke, more experts arrived. June brought August and the others, looking uneasy and saying little.

After a while, the Hou Race arrived, followed quickly by the Space Ancient Beast Race. However... the Fate Clan didn't come!

Yes, the Fate Clan was absent.

At first, Marquis Xia and the others didn't pay much attention, but as they watched experts from various races arrive, including the human Daofuse experts and the guardians, they noticed the absence of the Fate Clan.

In an instant, everyone felt a sense of foreboding.

The Fate Clan, even if the Fate Emperor couldn't come, surely some Eternals could, right? Why... was there not a single one from the Fate Clan?

The Fate Emperor had come last time!

Today, many people had gathered, but it wasn't as grand as last time. Last time, there were dozens of Daofuse experts, but today, while there were some, apart from Hongmeng, there seemed to be no other top-tier Daofuse experts.

Tian Yue, Duobao, Empyrean Cloud, and Mountain Rise were all present, but most were newly ascended Daofuse experts. The old guard, like June and the Hou Pseudo Emperor, while strong, weren't considered top-tier.

...

A group of people waited outside the Luminous Domain Mansion.

The next moment, the palace doors opened.

The one opening the doors was not the familiar Wan Tiansheng or the Great Zhou King. Instead, it was Liu Wenyan, who was somewhat unfamiliar to everyone.

Yes, Liu Wenyan.

Liu Wenyan opened the palace doors, and the group exchanged glances before entering the hall one by one.

At the top of the hall, Su Yu no longer sat upright.

Today, Su Yu had taken off the golden robe that everyone had draped over him and wore his own white robe. He no longer wore the crown, leaning lazily against the chair with a hint of indulgence.

This was different from before!

What exactly was different, no one was sure, but some Daofuse experts vaguely sensed it.

Today's Su Yu was no longer shrouded in mystery. They... seemed to be able to see through him.

His physical body was incredibly strong, but there was no longer the turbulent power of laws.

Though powerful, he no longer exuded the suffocating aura he once did.

"Greetings, Your Majesty!"

Everyone greeted in unison, their voices echoing in all directions.

"No need for formalities!"

Su Yu smiled, "Take a seat, everyone. Food and drinks have been prepared. Consider this a gathering. All good things must come to an end! Eat, drink, chat, and then... everyone can go about their business!"

At these words, some people's expressions changed slightly.

Su Yu said nothing more, looking at Topsoil Spirit with a smile, "Strange, I told you that coming might not be a good thing, and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't come! Your Five Elemental Race hasn't participated in the war, so why are you here now? You're a smart person, why are you doing something foolish?"

Topsoil Spirit quickly stood up, smiling, "Whether good or bad, it's better to come than not. Being summoned by Emperor Yu is a blessing for the Five Elemental Race!"

"How pretentious!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Sit down, everyone!"

The people below exchanged glances, then looked at the tables on either side of the hall, and had no choice but to take their seats.

The Daofuse experts sat in front, the Eternals in the middle, and the Sunmoon experts at the back.

At this moment, some of the guardians of the major realms, including the Great Han King and others, had also returned. They were puzzled, but there was no longer a leader to be found.

The Great Zhou, Great Xia, Great Qin, and Great Ming Kings, the four great experts, were all absent today.

A vague sense of unease lingered.

Su Yu raised his wine glass, smiling, "Fate brought us together. We are all connected by destiny. Let's raise a glass and drink!"

With that, he downed his drink in one go!

Not knowing what else to do, everyone followed suit, raising their glasses and drinking.

After finishing his drink, Su Yu's smile faded, "The Daofuse experts should have noticed something. Duobao, tell us, what did you see?"

In the crowd, Duobao's face stiffened. After a long pause, he stammered, "I didn't see anything..."

Su Yu's gaze turned cold, "Then you're a useless Daofuse expert. What kind of Daofuse are you? Are you blind?"

"......"

Duobao was on the verge of tears. He didn't dare to speak!

"Speak!"

Duobao trembled, gritting his teeth. After a long while, he lowered his head and said, "I... I saw that Emperor Yu... seems... seems to have fallen in realm! From the Heavenly King Realm to the Sunmoon Realm..."

Boom!

The words sent shockwaves through the assembly. Faces turned toward Duobao, who lowered his head, cursing inwardly. "I told you I didn't dare to speak, yet you forced me to. Bullying the honest, are you?"

Among the crowd, the other Daofuse cultivators wore solemn expressions, saying nothing. It was June who broke the silence with a naive smile, "Emperor Yu must have encountered a minor issue in cultivation. I believe it will be resolved soon..."

Su Yu raised a hand, interrupting him calmly, "Senior June, there's no need to defend me."

"This time, let's be straightforward and direct. I've fallen in cultivation, my Great Dao has shattered, and I've dropped to the Sunmoon Realm. My lifespan... is less than a hundred years, perhaps even shorter. Because of my fall, the longevity gained from Daofuse isn't being retracted, but the remaining lifespan might allow me to live ten or twenty years if I'm lucky."

"If I can't reach the realm of a Master of Rules within ten or twenty years... I probably won't survive."

The crowd was shaken. So soon?

The distance from Heavenly King to Master of Rules wasn't far, but... Sunmoon?

Su Yu continued, "This time, I ascended with some powerful allies. Talents abound, and the strong were like clouds. Yet... I lost."

Su Yu smiled, "I lost miserably. Let me put it this way: aside from me, Fat Ball, and Marquis Tongtian, the others... most likely won't return. Either they've fallen, or they're gravely injured, hiding somewhere with only a fragment of their sea of will left."

Boom!

The revelation was like a stone thrown into a thousand waves, causing the entire hall to erupt.

Empyrean Cloud, visibly shaken, asked, "Then Heavendoom and Grandstar...?"

Su Yu replied calmly, "They've fallen."

Empyrean Cloud was stunned, as if turned to stone.

June trembled violently, "Emperor Yu... is this... a joke?"

Su Yu remained calm, "No, I'm not joking. There's no need for such jokes. At my peak, I was defeated. No matter how many opponents I killed, or who I killed, I still lost. The people I took up there... are almost all gone."

In just a few days!

Everyone was deeply shocked, even Hongmeng couldn't help but speak, "Multiple Heavenly King Realm experts..."

Su Yu exhaled, "We encountered two Heavenly Sovereigns, six Heavenly Kings, and thirty Daofuse cultivators in a direct confrontation! Additionally, three more Heavenly Sovereigns came to aid them, and even a Master of Rules participated. The myriad races gathered over ten Heavenly Sovereign-level experts..."

"What is a Heavenly Sovereign?"

At this moment, someone couldn't help but ask.

Su Yu replied indifferently, "They are beings who, due to the restrictions of rules, haven't stepped into the realm of a Master of Rules but possess the power of that realm! And a Master of Rules is akin to the ancient Human Kings and the ancient emperors of the heavens! Does that make it clear?"

Upon hearing this, those who were previously unaware of what a Heavenly Sovereign was turned pale.

Heavenly Sovereigns!

Over a dozen of them?

They encountered Heavenly Sovereigns!

And... a Master of Rules?

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was equally shocked, "Are there still Masters of Rules in this world?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu smiled, "So many years have passed, and even with the restrictions of rules, some have found ways to circumvent them!"

The Space Ancient Beast Emperor couldn't help but ask, "Emperor Yu, is this true?"

Su Yu nodded, "In the Upper Realm, I met your Dao companion, Marquis Lie Kong! I left Kong Kong there, which is a good thing... In the Upper Realm, I hadn't even had the chance to interact much with them before suffering this crushing defeat. In one battle, my foundation was exhausted!"

The Great Han King spoke heavily, "Emperor Yu, then... what about the Great Zhou King and the others?"

"They might be dead, or perhaps some of their sea of will remains..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "They all self-destructed, so the specifics are unclear."

"And Director Wan and the others?"

"The same."

Su Yu sighed, "Director Wan and the others... might have perished completely."

With a hint of self-mockery, he quickly turned it into a smile, "I couldn't win! There's nothing I can do! The Upper Realm is far stronger than I imagined. I went there, killed many, slew many powerful beings... Yet, the more I killed, the more there were, and the more despair I felt, helpless."

"But fortunately, we did one thing before, unsealed the Hundred Battle King. The Hundred Battle King is still alive and might descend soon..."

As soon as he said this, someone immediately retorted, "The Hundred Battle is a waste. Does Emperor Yu expect the Hundred Battle to lead the human race?"

The matter of the Hundred Battle was known throughout the Myriad Realms. Previously, even Su Yu had done some publicity to prevent the Hundred Battle from returning to seize power.

Of course, at this moment, Su Yu smiled, "Whether the Hundred Battle is a waste, I don't know, but I do know he has many strong followers. Not only that, but he himself possesses the combat power of a Master of Rules, albeit a weaker one. In the Myriad Realms, he is among the strongest."

"Yunshui, Shadow, Zhennan... these ancient marquises, some have fled, likely to support the Hundred Battle. They know where the Upper Realm passage is and should be able to bring people back. Soon... they might descend."

Upon hearing this, June's face changed, "Emperor Yu, do you mean Yunshui and the others have betrayed you and chosen the Hundred Battle?"

The Great Han King and others also turned pale!

What was happening?

"It's not really betrayal."

Su Yu smiled, "Each serves their own master! They were never truly mine, and I never subdued them. It's just... these guys used my map of the Great Dao and, at a critical moment, didn't follow my military orders... That's a crime, but calling it betrayal is unnecessary."

Su Yu smiled, "The Hundred Battle is the Human Lord of the Ninth Tide. They were loyal to the Hundred Battle from the start! I am me, the Hundred Battle is the Hundred Battle. The Ninth Tide and this tide are ultimately not one."

The atmosphere was heavy!

Everyone felt the weight.

Su Yu continued, "The Hundred Battle is returning. I can't defeat the Upper Realm, and my people are all gone... So, I must retreat!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "I'm used to being the boss and not accustomed to being someone's subordinate. So... I'm planning to retreat to the Death Realm!"

Boom!

With these words, many people shattered the tables before them, their auras spilling out.

Retreat?

Zhu Tiandao and the others didn't have time to think or grieve, only to be shocked.

Of course, amidst the shock, some were skeptical. Did their fathers really die?

If they did... there should be some sense of it.

There was no such feeling.

Could it be that their fathers changed bloodlines, so they didn't know if they died?

Of course, there was no time to dwell on these thoughts. At this moment, only shock remained. Su Yu... the Su Yu who conquered the Myriad Realms, was going to retreat and hide!

Once the crowd quieted, Su Yu said calmly, "Yes, you all heard correctly! Once the Hundred Battle returns, he will certainly seek to unify the human race again. I don't want to be his subordinate, so I've decided to leave! I'm not one to accept defeat easily, and I will find a way to rise again! But my Great Dao is truly broken, and my strong allies are truly lost. I don't know if I will ever see that day."

"I must go to the dark and sunless Death Realm. There... might be my only chance!"

"The Upper Realm has too many strong beings, the Hundred Battle is too strong, and in the Luminous Domain Mansion, there's a Martial Emperor who wants to kill me..."

Su Yu gave a self-deprecating smile, "Over the years, I've had few allies and many enemies! Of course, everyone has their own path, whether to continue following the Hundred Battle or to stay and ignore it, there's no real danger."

"However... some of my close friends should retreat with me!"

Su Yu looked at some people, at Hongmeng, and smiled, "Senior Hongmeng, come with me. Now, it's just like the beginning, before I became the Human Lord! Senior Hongmeng, you won't abandon me, will you?"

Hongmeng was heavy-hearted, and after a long pause, he said solemnly, "This old minister... will certainly follow!"

Su Yu smiled and nodded, "I've already informed the Fate Emperor. He didn't come this time, so don't worry about it! As for the Fate Clan, there's no need to mention it. There was never much cooperation!"

He looked at June, "You're not in much trouble. March is in the Upper Realm, very powerful, with the strength of a Heavenly Sovereign! Now the myriad races face strong enemies and still need to rely on March. Even if our relationship is exposed, it won't be a big problem!"

He then looked at the Space Ancient Beast Emperor, "Your Dao companion, Marquis Lie Kong, is at least a Heavenly King. You helped me fight, but didn't kill anyone, only resisted a few Daofuse cultivators, so it shouldn't be a big issue."

He turned to the Hou Pseudo Emperor and sighed, "I didn't want to drag you into this... but your race is too weak in the Upper Realm, with only one second-class Daofuse, not even a Heavenly King! If you're willing... you can come with me. If not, hide in the Hou Realm and plead for forgiveness, and perhaps it won't be a big deal!"

The Hou Race wasn't strong in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu then looked at the Topsoil Spirit, "You have no major issues, didn't participate in the battle, but your presence here might cause some trouble. However, it's not too serious!"

Finally, Su Yu addressed the humans, "You can follow me to the Death Realm and wait for my resurgence! But when we can see the light of day again... I don't know myself! If you stay, the Hundred Battle returns, and he won't treat you too harshly! The Hundred Battle might not be friendly to other races, but to humans... even if not as valued as his direct descendants, he won't kill you or deliberately mistreat you!"

Su Yu smiled, "After all, he was once a Human Lord, and such magnanimity should still be there, as long as you don't cause trouble for him!"

He gave instructions one by one.

Yet, the entire hall was filled with a deathly silence, and everyone's faces were extremely grim.

A crushing defeat!

Not only a crushing defeat, but Su Yu had lost even the human race's foundation. He was going to abandon the Human Realm and retreat to the Death Realm, that dark and sunless place, not knowing when he could rise again!

Below, the Great Han King spoke heavily, "Emperor Yu, you once said the old era has passed, and the New Yu Era has begun! And now... are you giving up?"

"I haven't given up!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, "I have never given up. Going to the Death Realm is also for a comeback! It's just that the lower realm is no longer suitable for me. Hundred Battle will surely return, and you can't expect me to bow before him. I refuse! Two kings should not meet! When a king meets another king, both as Human Lords, a confrontation is inevitable!"

After saying this, Su Yu continued, "I will find a way to rise again. I was alone and had nothing when I left the Great Xia Prefecture and when I ventured into the Allheaven Battlefield. At least now... I have some foundation!"

Su Yu was not merely declaring his downfall. He was also offering hope, showing that he was still striving, still struggling, still fighting! Whether they believed him or not... that was up to them.

He still had people under him. However, this time they had suffered a crushing defeat. If they couldn't accept even one defeat, then perhaps they would face more in the future. Those who were meant to leave would eventually leave. At least now, it wasn't a matter of life and death.

At this moment, if anyone chose to leave... Su Yu could only say that it was an inevitable outcome. Wan Tiansheng was right; before reaching the peak, one should experience defeat! Who can avoid defeat? Su Yu couldn't either!

If one failure could destroy everything, it meant the foundation was weak and not worth mourning over those who left.

Su Yu added, "If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me! Including the strength and forces of Hundred Battle, the various powers of the upper realm, and any intelligence, I will share it all!"

Su Yu smiled, "I won't deceive you; there's no need! Going to the Death Realm... honestly, can we really fight our way back? I don't know, but I carry hope! It might just be wishful thinking, but... I, Su Yu, will not give up!"

Su Yu smiled again, "Don't worry about whether you choose to stay or leave. I won't get angry or hold it against you! I, Su Yu, am not particularly magnanimous, but as long as you speak openly and don't play tricks, leaving is your freedom!"

"I despise those who scheme against me in secret, but I don't dislike those who leave openly due to differences in ideology or worsening circumstances."

"We have worked together and fought side by side. If you choose to leave today, that is your freedom. If you follow me to the Death Realm and can't endure its solitude, darkness, and despair, then it's best not to go. If you go and want to return... then I'll consider you a traitor!"

Su Yu's expression turned cold, "Leaving openly is fine, but traitors... I will kill them!"

The entire hall fell into a deep silence.

After a long while, Lord Xia glanced at Zhu Tiandao, who was also looking at him. The next moment, just as Lord Xia was about to speak, Zhu Tiandao quickly said, "Emperor Yu, will there be any changes with the South King and others once we reach the Death Realm?"

He spoke rapidly, "Can Marquis Lanshan and others still be relied upon to obey us? After all, the disastrous defeat in the upper realm has greatly weakened our strength! If Hundred Battle returns, he is also of the human race. Will Marquis Lanshan and the others follow the human race or the Luminous Domain Mansion... this needs to be discussed!"

Lord Xia wanted to interject, but Zhu Tiandao swiftly continued, "Also, if the thirty-six guardians, like Zhou Polong, want to leave, can we find enough replacements? If we can't replace them, will there be trouble without guardians?"

From the back, just as Zhou Polong was about to speak, Zhu Tiandao added, "If we evacuate, can we ensure the safety of ordinary people? How many can we accommodate? We must take responsibility for their food, clothing, and shelter. Is the Death Realm suitable for cultivation? Of course, we can scour the Myriad Realms, and even if there are billions, they won't starve for a hundred years!"

"Moreover, the Death Realm lacks source qi. We can't all cultivate death qi, right? How do we ensure that source qi and death qi don't conflict? Even if we bring a large amount of source qi treasures, we must consider preventing erosion..."

Just as Lord Xia was about to speak, Zhu Tiandao quickly said, "Also, will the Death Realm turn people into undead? Can we still ensure that everyone can have children and continue their lineage?"

Lord Xia opened his mouth, but Zhu Tiandao continued without pause, "Is it difficult to comprehend the power of the Great Dao over there?"

Lord Xia kept trying to speak, but Zhu Tiandao pressed on, "It seems we can't enter the River of Time. Can we find a way to bring the River of Time into it?"

"I..."

Lord Xia was about to speak, but Zhu Tiandao quickly said, "Regarding supplies, evacuation, and logistics, our Great Ming Prefecture can handle it! Of course, we need some assistance, depending on the number of people. Should we evacuate in batches or all at once? Will the three major races obstruct us during the evacuation?"

"Oh, right, if Hundred Battle returns, should we take all the resources with us and let them suffer, or should we leave them some food and drink out of consideration for the human race?"

"Additionally, if races like the Hou Race are willing to evacuate with us, will there be a fusion of races in the Death Realm? However, racial segregation might still exist, and I think this needs some discussion!"

"…"

Lord Xia opened his mouth, then chose to close it.

To hell with you!

Zhu the sycophant!

You bastard, you've said everything, what am I supposed to say?

And Zhu Tiandao, speaking at lightning speed, continued, "Also, if we evacuate and Hundred Battle returns, is there a gap? During this period, what if the three major races attack?"

"What if the myriad races resist?"

"Also, should we leave behind some cultural heritage?"

"Moreover, how should we handle the Culture King's Residence? It seems difficult to take it with us, but abandoning it would be a waste!"

"…"

Zhu Tiandao rattled off dozens, if not hundreds, of questions in one breath.

Clearly, the discussion was about who would stay and who would leave, but in his mouth, it turned into planning how to evacuate, how to take people away, and how to survive in the Death Realm.

He even considered future generations and offspring.

"Finally, since we're evacuating and taking other races with us, I think we can abolish the title of Human Lord and just call it Emperor Yu!"

"The Luminous Domain Mansion will be the Luminous Domain Mansion from now on! As for the title of Human Lord, I think it should be left to Hundred Battle. There's no need to compete with him for the title. So, we should unify the honorifics to avoid misunderstandings!"

Su Yu just watched him silently.

I'm discussing who will go and who will stay during this sad moment, and you're stealing the spotlight!

Zhu Tiandao seemed oblivious and continued, "Also, if we evacuate, I hope Marquis Tongtian can cooperate with me. He's responsible for teleportation, which I think is very beneficial. We could even teleport entire cities... I need some strong individuals to help me transport things, like the newly built Luminous Domain Mansion in the Human Realm, the Great Ming Cultural Research Academy, and the Primordial Spirit Research Institute... These places can be cut out and teleported directly!"

"This way, we can save time on rebuilding. As for Hundred Battle... he can handle it himself when he returns!"

Zhu Tiandao spoke eloquently, "So, Emperor Yu, rest assured. Leave all the logistics to me! I suggest establishing a logistics headquarters for the Luminous Domain Mansion. I think it could be named the Protection Bureau. Right now, no one might want to do it, but I can temporarily act as the head of the Protection Bureau... until Emperor Yu finds a suitable candidate, then I'll step down..."

"…"

Lord Xia said quietly, "Lord Zhu, if you're done speaking, I have something to say. I think... I can take on this role!"

"…"

What are you two doing?

Su Yu silently watched the two of them. This is a very sad moment, and you two bastards are vying for power?

Su Yu's face darkened slightly!

I'm about to evacuate to the Death Realm!

I'm no longer the overlord of the Myriad Realms!

Headache!

And at this moment, the others also looked at the two with strange expressions. This is a retreat, an evacuation, abandoning the lower realm to go to the dark and sunless Death Realm, to live with the undead. Are you really not worried at all?

Moreover, the Great Xia King and the Great Ming King might both be dead. Aren't you... worried?

And Su Yu, also troubled by these two, quickly said, "Everyone, consider it yourselves. Lord Zhu, you handle the evacuation work, and Lord Xia will assist! No matter how many people are willing to go with us, it's up to everyone! Also, before leaving, scour the Myriad Realms and all the myriad races for all usable treasures and take them all!"

"Don't boast outside. A defeat is a defeat. I, Su Yu, can bear failure and don't need to deceive anyone to follow me!"

"Explain everything to the entire human race, including allied races!"

"Also, there's no need to belittle Hundred Battle!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Whether Hundred Battle is a waste or a hero, there's no need to belittle him too much. If I belittle him, that's my business. You don't need to say these things. Let the human race judge for themselves! Also, I advise ordinary humans not to follow me; it's too dangerous! Leaving home to go to the Death Realm... there's no need for that!"

"Moreover, even if we leave, we must ensure order in the Human Realm remains stable. Don't let chaos ensue. Let Hundred Battle take over smoothly, as my final instructions to the human race!"

"Also, leave some basic cultivation resources behind, but take all the advanced ones. No need to leave them!"

With that, Su Yu waved his hand, feeling somewhat disheartened, "Go back and think about it. Hundred Battle's return... I estimate it will take about a month. He might know I'm evacuating, and since kings shouldn't meet, he won't return too early before I leave!"

"Finally, for those currently guarding ancient cities who don't want to continue, find Senior Hongmeng to revoke your duties. There's no need to station anyone for now!"

"Lord Zhu, arrange everything within a month!"

Su Yu stood up, raised his cup, "As I said, all good things must come to an end. Today, this last cup of wine is for all of you!"

Su Yu drank it all in one go!

With a hearty laugh, Su Yu declared, "Defeated, yes, but a single defeat is something I can bear. To those who remain, I hope for peaceful coexistence with the Hundred Battle King! My matters with him are my own and have nothing to do with any of you!"

Having said his piece, Su Yu turned and departed. His figure gradually faded away.

In the grand hall, everyone downed their drinks in one go, a sense of helplessness and melancholy hanging heavily in the air. How did things end up like this so suddenly?

Su Yu was withdrawing! The territory he had just conquered was now being handed over so easily. For a moment, everyone was filled with sighs and lamentations. Where should we go from here?
