Chapter 762: A Chill Down the Spine

Abyssal Realm.

As Su Yu continuously severed various powers of the Great Dao, the entire realm's energy became less pure and more chaotic. Absorbing it became increasingly difficult. However, Su Yu's goal wasn't for everyone to absorb it but to organize and refine the myriad powers of the Dao.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng's expression grew more solemn. Within the realm, people were advancing in cultivation, but he couldn't focus on them. He shouted loudly, "All Eternals, join me in organizing the power of the Great Dao, stabilize it, and prevent the overwhelming power of laws from impacting the realm!"

Everyone stopped absorbing and quickly soared into the sky. This was also Su Yu's previous instruction. They were here to stabilize the river. When the river began to overflow, their task was to bind these powers of the Great Dao into a cohesive whole, waiting for Su Yu to return and transform it into the Path of Time.

"The Five Elemental Path, we will stabilize it!" Topsoil Spirit called out, assigning the task to the Five Elemental Race.

"We'll handle the Space Path!" The Space Race quickly took on their task.

"I'll take the Devouring Path!"

"…"

One by one, the powerful cultivators began organizing according to their Dao attributes, dividing the tasks among themselves. Wan Tiansheng and Lantian were responsible for overseeing the Great Dao. Any paths not managed by others needed their attention to prevent the powers of the Great Dao from turning into chaos and impacting the entire realm. If it turned into chaos, the realm would become like Chaos Mountain, which wasn't beneficial for the cultivation of the myriad realms' cultivators.

Meanwhile, the opening in the sky seemed to be growing larger. Su Yu had severed a significant amount of the Great Dao's power, causing the river to show signs of overflowing. Lantian struggled to manage it, but he persisted.

The Hunting Heaven List appeared! A golden page floated in the air, with Lantian filtering it. Below, Wan Tiansheng, with a serious expression, mainly assisted Lantian in separating and organizing the inseparable powers of the Great Dao.

Everyone was immersed in the Great Dao. They silently comprehended, organized, and divided it. This was a process of transforming chaos into myriad paths and myriad paths into chaos. The opportunity was indeed rare. When the Human Emperor opened the path back then, he didn't even consider letting others help organize it. He alone was enough. Why involve others?

The Human Emperor's path opening was extremely secretive. Few knew about it, and those who did wouldn't care, let alone allow cultivators below the rule masters to help organize the Great Dao. With the Human Emperor opening such a large path, any cultivator below the rule masters attempting to organize the Great Dao would be overwhelmed and killed!

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng looked around and shouted, "South King, Marquis Lanshan, come quickly!"

The two powerful figures, who had been avoiding the dense death aura on one side, quickly arrived upon hearing the call.

South King asked in a deep voice, "What is it?"

"You two…" Wan Tiansheng quickly said, "In the Path of Time, the Path of Death has been extracted and is incomplete. I hope you two can provide some death energy to weave a Path of Death, integrating it into the myriad paths to perfect the realm's Great Dao power!"

The two exchanged heavy glances. Weaving a Path of Death? Is that possible?

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "You two can try. It's also a form of comprehension, a way to transform all you've learned into the Great Dao. If successful, South King might advance to Heavenly Sovereign, and Marquis Lanshan could step into the Heavenly King realm! This is an opportunity! Even if it doesn't work this time, once Emperor Yu opens the path, and you walk the map of the Great Dao again, you will surely ascend another level!"

He understood Su Yu's intentions, so he spared no effort to involve everyone as much as possible. Those capable should contribute more. In fact, Lantian and he could do many things, but unless others couldn't, the two wouldn't intervene. There was no benefit for them to do so, but for others, it might be a crucial moment of enlightenment.

"And Hetu… you can all try!" Wan Tiansheng quickly added, "Emperor Yu wants to transform death into life. When he returns, try integrating with this realm's path first, then attempt to open your own path, transforming death into life. If successful, he might be able to resurrect the dead!"

These words shook the hearts of the undead. Su Yu… was preparing to resurrect the dead?

Marquis Lanshan, not caring about anything else, urgently asked, "How do we weave the Great Dao?"

Wan Tiansheng was exasperated! How did you cultivate to the Daofuse Realm back then? I'm at a loss with you!

He had no choice but to quickly instruct, "According to what you envision, it's actually quite simple. What do you think the Path of Death looks like? Try using the power of laws to transform it into the Great Dao, compare it with other paths, and integrate it…"

Unfortunately, without opening the Heaven Gate, explaining it plainly wasn't very clear. The Great Dao was something that those who understood, understood. For those who didn't, no matter how you explained it, it was hard for them to grasp.

At this moment, a figure floated over. The West King's Consort suddenly tossed something to Marquis Lanshan, smiling faintly, "This is a virtual Path of Death. Comprehend it yourself, and you might gain some insights. Once you do, consider weaving the Path of Death!"

After speaking, the West King's Consort smiled, "Has the Petrification Path emerged? If so, I'll absorb some petrification power to perfect my pseudo-path."

As she spoke, a wave of petrification power spread. Suddenly, Lantian was petrified!

Just as Lantian was about to erupt, the West King's Consort soared into the sky, quickly grabbing a large amount of petrification power. Below, Hetu glanced at the West King's Consort, frowning slightly. His ancestor, King Gong, was adept at the Path of Petrification. Now, another one had appeared.

Not far away, the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King were anxious. What about them?

Wan Tiansheng, like a nanny, was also exhausted. Seeing the two idle, he shouted, "You two, get to work, comprehend the paths of spear, blade, metal, attack, and break! The power of the physical body path hasn't manifested yet, so don't worry about it!"

The two didn't say much and quickly got to work.

In the distance, the Great Zhou King seemed to be idling. Well, not really, but he was flitting between comprehending the Space Path, the Path of Confinement, the Path of Endurance, and the Path of Strong Attack…

Seeing this, Wan Tiansheng felt a headache. He knew the Great Zhou King was adept at various paths, but this old fellow was clearly slacking off.

"Great Zhou King!" Wan Tiansheng called out in a low voice, "Please set up a confinement array to prevent the power of the Great Dao from spilling over!"

"…"

The Great Zhou King was a bit helpless. I'm comprehending the Great Dao here. Do you think I have nothing to do?

Forget it, I'll continue with my work.

At this moment, a loud rumble echoed, and a wave of blade energy shook the heavens. In the distance, Xia Longwu wielded the Guiyuan Blade, slashing towards the void. In the void, a long blade seemed to materialize!

In the distance, the Great Han King and others were momentarily stunned!

The next moment, the faces of the Great Han King and several others changed.

This… isn't right!

Damn!

Xia Longwu has reached the Daofuse Realm!

This shouldn't be!

Aren't we all older than him? Besides, Xia Longwu only recently attained the Eternal Realm during the last great battle. How did he advance so quickly?

Over there, Xia Longwu's face was cold as frost. He didn't care about the others. He turned his head to look at Liu Wenyan and the others, especially Liu Wenyan. His expression was stern, "Liu Wenyan, I've reached the Daofuse Realm! You're still at the ninth level of the Sunmoon Realm… what are you waiting for?"

Liu Wenyan's face turned pale. Xia Longwu had reached the Daofuse Realm! This was probably the fastest advancement to the Daofuse Realm in recent years, apart from those madmen like Wan Tiansheng and Lantian.

Xia Longwu had always been exceptionally talented. After Su Yu helped him embark on the Path of the Blade, he progressed rapidly, and now, he had stepped into the Daofuse Realm. Meanwhile, Liu Wenyan, who was older than him, remained at the ninth level of the Sunmoon Realm.

In the distance, Wan Tiansheng also glanced at Liu Wenyan, frowning slightly, and said, "Your talent was the strongest back then, far surpassing Xia Longwu and the others. Now, Xia Longwu has reached the Daofuse Realm, and your student Su Yu has become Emperor Yu! After all these years, what are you holding onto? Your teacher's death back then wasn't your fault…"

Liu Wenyan's voice was bitter, "I… I have no regrets towards my teacher! The only ones I owe are my Liu family…"

He had no regrets towards Ye Batian! So, he didn't feel guilty towards Ye Batian. His true regret was towards the Liu family.

Wan Tiansheng frowned. Liu Wenyan was very talented. Back then, the entire multi-divine character faction was waiting for him, watching him. Now, resources were abundant, and the power of the Great Dao was plentiful. Zhao Li and Zhao Tianbing both showed signs of reaching the Eternal Realm. Even the Heavenly Casting King seemed on the verge of entering the Daofuse Realm. Zhao Li and the others were once inferior to Liu Wenyan.

Zhu Tiandao and Marquis Xia had both reached the Daofuse Realm. Yun Chen and Nan Wujian had also reached the Daofuse Realm. Even Hong Tan was catching up, reaching the eighth or ninth level of the Sunmoon Realm, with a trend of surpassing Liu Wenyan, perhaps even having already surpassed him.

Why was Liu Wenyan still unable to step into the Eternal Realm?

Seeing Wan Tiansheng looking at him, Liu Wenyan forced a bitter smile. Suddenly, a divine character appeared before him: "I wish to walk the true path of civilization, directly stepping into the Daofuse Realm, with divine characters entering the Daofuse Realm! But… my heart is uneasy, and this divine character… may not become a path!"

He wanted to be a true civilization master! What is a true civilization master? A divine character that grows directly into the Daofuse Realm, that's a true civilization master, with no Eternal stage in between.

In fact, Wan Tiansheng and Lantian were similar. When their divine characters opened the path, they were comparable to true Daofuse or even Heavenly King-level powerhouses.

Liu Wenyan wasn't opening a path, but he also wanted to directly integrate his divine character into the Daofuse Realm.

The divine character before him was special, a "lock" character. A rare divine character.

Liu Wenyan looked at Wan Tiansheng and said softly, "Locking emotions and paths, Uncle Wan, for so many years, my heart has been locked! I have no regrets towards my teacher, no regrets towards the entire multi-divine character faction. I've never given up, always struggling for the multi-divine character faction… The only ones I owe are the thousand lives of my Liu family…"

Wan Tiansheng frowned. A lock! A heart lock! Liu Wenyan had locked himself, no wonder he couldn't reach the Dao. Hong Tan and the others were close, even Chen Yong was close.

Liu Wenyan, who had once directly stepped into the ninth level of the Sunmoon Realm, remained at that level. His heart was locked tight, and even Wan Tiansheng couldn't help him. Wan Tiansheng knew, however, that there was someone else alive from the Liu family besides Liu Wenyan's uncle. That person was the infant from back then, now known as Huang Jiu. Many were aware of this, but Liu Wenyan was not. Huang Jiu had previously requested that her identity not be mentioned in front of the Liu family. Raised by Kong Kong, she was human by birth but had the heart of the Space Ancient Beast Race. Huang Jiu wasn't wrong; the bond of nurture often surpasses that of birth. Besides, she had no feelings for the Liu family, only for Kong Kong.

Su Yu didn't bring this up, nor did he mention it again. Wan Tiansheng understood that if he brought it up now, and if Huang Jiu was willing to acknowledge her roots and forgive Liu Wenyan, perhaps Liu Wenyan's heart could be unlocked. But Wan Tiansheng glanced at Huang Jiu in the distance and sighed inwardly, choosing not to speak. Unlocking Liu Wenyan's heart might allow him to step into the Daofuse Realm. But was it necessary? Huang Jiu didn't want to acknowledge her roots, and there was no need to force it.

Back then, Liu Wenyan had indeed implicated the entire Liu family, refusing to hand over Ye Batian's divine character even at the cost of his life. This matter might still require troubling the Great Zhou King. Not far away, the Great Zhou King quickly vanished, sensing malice. He felt wronged; he hadn't been the one targeting Liu Wenyan's lineage back then. The Great Zhou Prefecture hadn't intervened, merely choosing to watch from the sidelines. He wasn't involved, so why trouble him now? These were old matters, like rotten sesame seeds and moldy grains; why focus on him?

Wan Tiansheng didn't dwell on Liu Wenyan's situation. It was a difficult topic, and Liu Wenyan's inability to prove his path to Daofuse was beyond help. Instead, Wan Tiansheng turned his attention to the various guardians, the veteran ones. His eyes brightened as he shouted, "Guardians of Frost and Snow, find a way to advance to Daofuse!"

These veteran guardians had potential. They were already at the ninth level of the Eternal Realm. Among the 36 guardians, five had chosen to retire, opting for a peaceful life. Some were still in seclusion within the ancient city, while others had retired to various realms. Including Hongmeng, there were 31 veteran guardians, but only 10 had reached the Daofuse Realm. The rest had not yet stepped into that realm. This was their opportunity.

Wan Tiansheng manipulated the power of laws, favoring these individuals, giving them hope for advancement. The Great Han King, the Great Tang King, and other human experts with potential to advance to Daofuse also received some favor, with a large influx of the power of laws. If they couldn't achieve Daofuse this time, with Su Yu paving the way, and by comprehending the map of the Great Dao, they should eventually succeed. If they couldn't seize any of these three opportunities, it would mean their aptitude was truly lacking. However, in this era, how many who reached the high stages of the Eternal Realm were truly foolish?

If successful, this time could see the birth of many Daofuse Realm experts. Yet, top-tier combat power remained scarce. Wan Tiansheng once again looked at the few Heavenly King-level beings. The Great Zhou King could be ignored, but Hongmeng, the old turtle who was once the foremost figure in the Myriad Realms, caught Wan Tiansheng's attention. Wan Tiansheng furrowed his brow slightly and asked, "Senior Hongmeng, what kind of power of the Great Dao do you need?"

Hongmeng, seeing Wan Tiansheng approach him, felt a bit helpless. He understood Wan Tiansheng's intentions; stepping into the Heavenly Sovereign Realm might also be what Su Yu hoped for. However... the old turtle thought for a moment and said, "To become a Heavenly Sovereign is extremely difficult for me! But it's not impossible. My Dao companion once observed the Primordial Divine Mountain and pioneered this path. If I could observe the Primordial Divine Mountain again, perhaps I could gain more insights and step into the Heavenly Sovereign domain, laying the foundation for mastering the power of the Great Dao!"

A Heavenly Sovereign was essentially a master of rules, only unable to fully control the Great Dao at present.

"The Primordial Divine Mountain?" Wan Tiansheng furrowed his brow. "There's a Ren Mountain in the Upper Realm, also a divine mountain within Chaos Mountain, incredibly powerful. Is it that mountain?"

"No," the old turtle explained. "It's another one. My Dao companion encountered it in the chaos back then. I don't know where it is now! But this mountain is different from other divine mountains, resembling an old turtle coiled around a dragon..."

What does that mean? The old turtle can coil around a dragon?

While Wan Tiansheng was pondering, Heavendoom laughed heartily and said, "It's like the old turtle has a pile of dung on its back, got it?"

"..."

Got it! Vivid!

Wan Tiansheng instantly understood. You could have just said it directly; it's like a turtle with a pile of dung on its shell, right? The old turtle's face turned black as he glared at Heavendoom, wishing he could kill him. It's called the old turtle coiling around a dragon! Do you understand? What do you mean by a pile of dung on the old turtle's back? Go to hell!

Heavendoom grinned, baring his teeth, and shouted, "Where's the power of the Great Club? Give me some of that power; I think I'm about to step into the third-tier Daofuse Realm!"

The old turtle replied coolly, "So what if you're third-tier? You never win in fights!"

Is that a jab? Who can't do that? Heh!

Heavendoom's face turned ugly, and he fell silent. Have I never won? He suddenly thought of something and looked towards a sneaky figure in the corner, shouting, "Duobao, didn't I beat you last time?"

Who said I never won? I beat Duobao!

Duobao cursed inwardly but smiled obsequiously, "Yes, yes, Brother Heavendoom beat me!"

Seeing Duobao so submissive, Heavendoom lost interest. Beating this coward was meaningless! Boring fellow!

Wan Tiansheng ignored him and turned his attention to the other Heavenly Kings, especially Fat Ball. Wan Tiansheng frowned slightly and asked, "Senior Fat Ball, any progress in opening your path?"

Fat Ball didn't possess Heavenly Sovereign-level combat power; it was only a Heavenly King. However, with the boots, it could fight against a Heavenly Sovereign. If it inherently possessed Heavenly Sovereign-level combat power, combined with the boots, it wouldn't say it could fight against a master of rules, but it would be stronger than an average Heavenly Sovereign. But how to help it advance?

Fat Ball was running around aimlessly, while others were sorting out their Great Dao. It had nothing to do and was quite bored. Hearing this, it thought for a moment and said, "I'm good at the Bite Dao, and that's the path I'm opening! How to continue... I don't know!"

"..."

Headache!

None of the Heavenly Kings seemed to have hope of advancing to Heavenly Sovereign. Without Heavenly Sovereign-level combat power, it remained a significant shortcoming. As for himself and Lantian, there was hope, but it would take some time. The old turtle needed to observe the mountain, Huoyun could proceed step by step, the Consort of Qi was absorbing petrification power, and Fat Ball didn't know how to continue opening its path. As for the Great Zhou King, if he could endure the two paths thoroughly, there might still be a chance.

Among this large group of Heavenly Kings, was there really no one who could advance to Heavenly Sovereign?

As he was thinking, suddenly, in the distance, a massive Iron Devourer roared madly, its body growing larger and stronger, its aura becoming immensely powerful. Everyone was stunned, thinking it was June, but upon closer inspection, it was actually September! At this moment, September's body was incredibly robust, though it was all illusory. Its Great Dao was immensely powerful, and its physical body had exploded. September had been at the fourth-tier Daofuse Realm, but now its aura suddenly reached the third tier, then the second tier, and even seemed to be advancing towards the Heavenly King level.

Beside it, June's body appeared smaller. September, with its big, silly eyes, noticed the attention and grinned foolishly, "I... I didn't have any insights. It was all infused by my second ancestor. This is the path my second ancestor opened. The second ancestor fell, but left some remnants, directly giving me the path..."

Indeed, it hadn't gained much insight, but its path was different from others. September's path was directly given by the remnants of February's last moment. At that time, February had said that September inheriting its path might have the potential to become a master of rules, but that was enough. Previously, September lacked the power of rules. Now, with sufficient power of rules, it seemed to be on the verge of advancing to the Heavenly King level!

Everyone was speechless, cursing inwardly. Second-generation ancestor! Yes, that's what it was. They cursed but were envious. What could they do? September's ancestor was powerful, leaving behind the Great Dao for it. September didn't need to work hard; perhaps after sleeping for a hundred thousand years, it would awaken as a master of rules!

Just as September, the second-generation ancestor, advanced, suddenly, a powerful Five Elemental force surged! At that moment, if the Heaven Gate were opened, one would see a Great Dao of Five Elements merging into one. A small path extended, attempting to forcibly merge the separated Five Elemental paths. Su Yu had visited the Five Elemental Race before. Their Great Dao had been forcibly torn apart by a powerful being, split into five small paths, unable to merge, thus preventing them from becoming Daofuse.

In this race, the only one with hope was Topsoil Spirit. It was the origin of the Five Elemental Ancestor! When it became Daofuse, merging the Five Elemental Great Dao once more, the entire Five Elemental Race would have hope of producing Daofuse Realm beings again. At this moment, the entire Five Elemental Race, over a dozen Eternal Realm experts, were unimaginably excited. They all looked at Topsoil Spirit. At this moment, Topsoil Spirit's aura fluctuated, and the power of the Great Dao overflowed, yet it couldn't complete the unification of the Five Elemental Great Dao. Even though they couldn't see the Great Dao, they could feel the five forces within it dispersing, unable to merge!

Lantian and Wan Tiansheng took one look and instantly understood. They had been researching this recently. The Five Elemental forces hadn't formed a closed loop. Although Topsoil Spirit wasn't like Su Yu, aiming for the unification of myriad paths, it was aiming for the unification of the Five Elements. Currently, the Five Elemental forces still existed independently.

Wan Tiansheng, seeing this, immediately shouted, "The simplest way for the Five Elements to form a closed loop is the principle of mutual generation! Topsoil Spirit, you should understand this! Metal generates water, water generates wood..."

Topsoil Spirit, with the Five Elemental forces accumulating within, nodded painfully, "I know, but my Five Elemental forces still can't merge... If this continues, I won't be able to step into Daofuse!"

Without stepping into Daofuse, it couldn't forcibly unify the Five Elemental Great Dao, and the beings of its race would still be unable to step into the Daofuse Realm!

In the vast expanse of the Myriad Realms, the Five Elemental Race was once considered a formidable force. Yet, when it came to the Daofuse Realm, they were nothing. Once a mighty race, they now lacked even a single Daofuse expert. This was the true tragedy.

Topsoil Spirit followed Su Yu in hopes that the Five Elemental Race could break this curse. He hoped to step into the Daofuse Realm. If he could achieve this, the five ancestors of the race, all at the peak of the Eternal level, might instantly advance to Daofuse. But that was their limit; they could not progress further.

Other races had powerful beings in the Upper Realm, but the Five Elemental Race had none. The Iron Devourer Race had Heavenly Sovereigns and Kings. The Fate Clan did too. The Space Ancient Beast Race was close, with at least a Heavenly King. As for the Hou Race, they faced a crisis, leaving only a second-tier Daofuse in the Upper Realm.

The Five Elemental Race, despite its reputation, had never participated in a single battle since siding with Su Yu. They lacked the qualifications, which was the saddest part. They couldn't rely on luck forever. Only by becoming strong themselves could they secure a place by Su Yu's side.

Topsoil Spirit longed to reach Daofuse. He continuously absorbed vast amounts of elemental power, yet he couldn't unify them. He was stronger than other members of his race, who could only absorb one element. He could absorb all five, but without unification, it was useless.

Wan Tiansheng observed with a slight frown, puzzled. Topsoil Spirit's elemental powers were balanced, yet they couldn't merge. Why was that? He had studied the unification of the five elements, as had Su Yu and others. Logically, balance should lead to unification, achieving a state where the five elements interlock and merge.

Something was off.

Wan Tiansheng tried absorbing the elemental power himself. Instantly, the five forces merged into a new power. From afar, members of the Five Elemental Race watched, and upon seeing him casually release a unique power, Topsoil Spirit, a steadfast genius, suddenly broke down.

"Why?" he cried, unwilling and frantic. Why could auxiliary cultivators like Wan Tiansheng easily unify the five elements, while they couldn't? Why couldn't the Five Elemental Race achieve this?

Wan Tiansheng shouted, "Don't rush. It might be related to those who split the Five Elemental Dao in the past. I haven't opened the Heaven Gate, so I can't see clearly. Maybe when Emperor Yu returns, he can see something!"

Indeed, he couldn't see much. But Topsoil Spirit was absorbing too much power. If he continued, he might explode.

The problem might lie in the Dao itself.

As they spoke, a rift seemed to appear in the sky, as if the heavens were about to break. At that moment, they vaguely saw a figure—a massive silhouette!

It was Su Yu!

He was reflected from the River of Time into the realm, his body immensely powerful. At that moment, Su Yu seemed unaware, not sensing anything, as he roared in agony, "It hurts so much!"

"Damn!"

"It hurts so much!"

"Ahhh!"

"Help!"

"Stop coming!"

"Ahhh, Dad, help!"

"..."

Everyone's eyes were filled with disbelief.

Was this really Su Yu?

It couldn't be.

The colossal figure overshadowed the sky, like a pinhole camera effect. Su Yu's body wasn't that large, yet here, he covered the entire sky!

Su Yu, known for his arrogance and scholarly demeanor, always calm and proud in public, now appeared so vulnerable, crying out in pain.

In an instant, everyone's expressions changed.

The next moment, Wan Tiansheng waved his hand, darkening the sky. He transmitted a message, "No one mention this... If you do and he finds out, you'll face his wrath... Ahem, just keep it to yourselves!"

Su Yu always gossiped about others, but this time... this time, it wasn't us gossiping about you!

The sky had leaked!

Su Yu hadn't even sensed it. The sky leaked, projecting him into the Abyssal Realm.

At that moment, thousands outside the realm wore strange expressions, but no one spoke, pretending not to know.

This matter... just look and forget it, don't mention it.

As Wan Tiansheng said, whoever mentions it will be unlucky!

Over there, Heavendoom sneakily poked a small hole in the sky, thinking no one noticed, quietly peeking.

Fat Ball, seeing no one paying attention, wagged its tail and poked a small hole with its tail tip, peeking through.

Doubao sneezed, creating a small hole, and the family of three gathered, six eyes peering upward.

Soon, the barrier Wan Tiansheng set up was riddled with small holes!

Wan Tiansheng, of course, was aware.

He looked helpless!

These guys were useless in serious matters but first in watching a spectacle!

If Su Yu found out... whoever mentioned it in front of him would get beaten!

Guaranteed!

He didn't stop them. It was good to let everyone see Su Yu's true side. Su Yu wasn't just domineering and arrogant; he endured pain unknown to others.

Su Yu, so resilient, was in immense pain now, indicating that opening the rift wasn't simple.

Everyone enjoyed the conveniences and benefits Su Yu brought, but they probably didn't realize what he endured in the River of Time.

Indeed, as they watched, the gossiping glances faded.

At that moment, Su Yu was cursing and howling in agony!

He was in pain!

The myriad Daos attacked his heart!

Marquis Lanshan and others, initially excited, now looked on with some sympathy. He was in pain!

While everyone below chatted and absorbed power, they seemed to forget Su Yu was opening a rift in the River of Time. They thought it was just digging a hole, but now they realized Su Yu was enduring unimaginable pain.

...

"Ah!"

"Damn!"

"I'm done, I'm quitting..."

In the River of Time, Su Yu was indeed cursing madly!

It hurt!

Pain was one thing, but the various Dao powers flowing through him, itching to the core, were unbearable.

Corrosive power eroded him, turning his body to bone in an instant.

Su Yu was here, doing rough processing, the first stage of processing!

Compared to Lantian below, he endured much more pain. Lantian, after Su Yu and the River of Time's barrier, faced much weaker forces.

The myriad Dao insights, though strengthening, were too much for Su Yu.

He howled and cursed madly!

He cried, howled, calling for his father to save him, calling Hundred Battle a grandson, calling Control King a dog...

He didn't know how long it had been when Su Yu seemed to sense something, looking down. Could he vaguely see the Abyssal Realm?

Was it connected?

Su Yu didn't know!

But his expression changed slightly, instantly silencing himself. Wasn't it connected?

The water of time flowed, seemingly not smoothly.

"Shouldn't it be connected?"

Su Yu thought, if it were connected... wouldn't they see me?

With some doubt, suppressing the pain, Su Yu suddenly shouted, "Lantian, are you there?"

Silence.

Su Yu exhaled, relieved. It shouldn't be connected!

...

Abyssal Realm.

Su Yu's roar startled Lantian, who trembled slightly but held back, not making a sound.

I didn't hear anything!

At this moment, he couldn't respond.

The entire Abyssal Realm was eerily quiet. Even while sorting the myriad Dao forces, everyone suffered some backlash, yet they all remained silent.

Holding back!

If Su Yu found out everyone was watching... they'd be in trouble.

From Heavenly Kings to Sunmoon Realm cultivators, everyone played deaf and mute, not making a sound.

In the River of Time, Su Yu shouted, and seeing no response, he thought it wasn't connected, continuing to grind down the Dao forces, cursing all the while, "A bunch of bastards, not a single rift opened yet, did they hit outside the realm?"

Heavendoom wanted to shout, no!

But as he was about to, gazes swept over him, scaring him into silence!

Right, can't shout.

Wan Tiansheng transmitted, "Everyone, continue as you were, just don't make a sound. Alright, keep sorting the myriad Dao forces. Once the rift opens, a surge of chaotic power will come. Make sure to sort the myriad Dao forces well... Don't let this realm become a chaotic zone!"

Great Qin King also transmitted, "Are we... are we sure not to notify him? What if he thinks he hit the wrong direction and tries somewhere else?"

"Nonsense, it's almost open. Why would he change places now? Even if he does, he'll open this area first before moving!"

"Then it's fine!"

Everyone fell silent again, and Su Yu howled once more.

He didn't know how long it had been when a rumbling sound echoed.

Su Yu shouted, "Damn it, isn't it open yet? The Starry Sky Seal is about to explode! I can't hold on!"

He really couldn't hold on much longer!

Why wasn't it open yet?

Just a small hole, was it that hard?

He had ground down over a hundred paths, surely it should have worn through by now?

At that moment, Lantian below sensed something, gaining some insight. Holding back for a while, unable to contain it, he prioritized the task at hand, transmitting to everyone, "Later, just say you heard him speak..."

Everyone nodded in understanding.

At that moment, Lantian suddenly shouted, "Is it Emperor Yu? Can you hear us? Can you hear?"

His shout faintly echoed into the River of Time.

...

Su Yu was howling madly when he suddenly sensed some Dao fluctuations.

The next moment, he seemed to hear Lantian's voice, instantly overjoyed. Was it open?

Chapter 780: Breaking Through

Moments later, Lantian's voice faintly echoed again, "Emperor Yu, just a little more, hold on! There's probably a crucial power of the Great Dao that hasn't been severed yet! Once it's broken, the entire passage will open!"

Su Yu was overjoyed!

But after the initial joy... he paused slightly.

What did that mean?

I need to break through various Great Daos to make a passage. I never mentioned this, so how did you know?

How do you know that I need to break through the Great Dao to dig a passage?

Strange!

Su Yu frowned. Could it be that Lantian had sensed it somehow?

Well, with the power of the Great Dao pouring down below, it made sense that Lantian and the others could guess.

Su Yu felt a bit more at ease and didn't dwell on it further.

Was there still a crucial power of the Great Dao left to be severed?

"Life and death, yin and yang, the Five Elements... I've already broken these key Great Daos!"

"I've even broken the Space Dao... what other crucial power of the Great Dao is there?"

The next moment, Su Yu pondered.

Perhaps... there really was one.

The Dao of the Flesh!

This is also a fundamental Great Dao!

Yes, the Dao of the Flesh hasn't been severed yet!

Once it's broken, a large amount of the power of the flesh's rules will surely gush out. Perhaps... this is the chance for everyone to restore their bodies.

Su Yu's eyes lit up, and he quickly began searching for the Dao of the Flesh.

Soon enough, indeed, within his Heaven Gate, a solid Great Dao appeared.

Evidently, this Dao might be blocking the entire passage, preventing it from being like the Human Emperor's Celestial River, where the water flows out instantly.

"Break the Dao of the Flesh!"

Su Yu continuously began to bombard it, his body trembling, grinding away.

Gritting his teeth, he persevered.

Just a little more!

Once it's through, I can leave directly.

Boom!

The Dao of the Flesh was broken by Su Yu. This wasn't the human race's Dao of the Flesh, nor was it the myriad races'. It was merely the Dao of the Flesh mixed within the barrier.

Once broken, countless powers of the flesh surged into Su Yu's body.

This time, Su Yu gained significant benefits.

His entire body was instantly strengthened.

Boom!

And at that moment, a vortex of power formed within the entire river, and the passage opened!

...

Below.

Lantian spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and roared, "Quick, stabilize the myriad Daos, the power of the river is leaking, stabilize it quickly!"

One by one, the powerful figures could no longer care about Su Yu's gossip and frantically began to stabilize the power of the myriad Daos.

Vaguely, the Abyssal Realm seemed to be on the verge of returning to chaos!

At this moment, Su Yu took a step forward. As he stepped out, his white robe was like snow, fluttering like an immortal.

His face was full of determination and calmness!

"Stabilize the myriad Daos, I will construct the Dao barrier, don't panic!"

At this moment, Su Yu, following the river's flow, emerged with unparalleled grace, as if he had just been digging a hole, very casually, with a mysterious confidence!

If it weren't for everyone knowing what had happened earlier, they might really think it was that easy.

At this moment, a phrase flashed through everyone's mind—putting on a brave face!

This is a scholar!

Clearly crying like a child earlier, yet now exuding the confidence of a father!

And among the crowd, the South King looked at Su Yu with a face full of pity, poor child!

Marquis Lanshan looked at him with admiration and affection, thinking how pitiful yet admirable the Emperor Yu was, enduring so much suffering without a word.

Over there, Empyrean Cloud almost said, "Yu baby, don't cry," having heard the earlier cries, feeling so sorry!

Initially, Su Yu didn't pay much attention, quickly stabilizing the entire passage. Just as he was about to ask the South King for some death energy... he turned around and was stunned. Why are they looking at me like that?

Is there something on my face?

Strange!

No time to think more, Su Yu shouted, "South King, provide me with some death energy. What are you all doing? The myriad Daos are unbalanced, are you blind? Help me stabilize the myriad Daos!"

The South King didn't mind at all, quickly providing death energy, eyes full of affection, thinking what a stubborn child, so pitiful!

Su Yu felt the gazes from behind, feeling extremely awkward.

Damn!

What's going on?

He vaguely thought of something, and his heart chilled... it couldn't be, right?

Earlier, it wasn't through yet!
