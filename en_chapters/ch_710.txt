Chapter 710: Strategizing to Slay the Daofuse (A Request for Subscription)

In the north, the Dragon Clan's territories were numerous. 

In the Upper Realm, territories were the main focus. A single Daofuse cultivator often occupied a region, establishing sects and nations, becoming a dominant force. This was easy to understand. 

If ten or eight Daofuse cultivators gathered in one place, there wouldn't be enough power of laws for everyone. If one cultivates, the others can't. If one absorbs, where would the others find their share? 

It's not that they don't know the dangers of dispersing. It's just that they have no choice. If too many Daofuse cultivators gather, cultivating becomes akin to fighting. If a Heavenly King comes and absorbs all the power, the other Daofuse cultivators can't cultivate at all. 

In the Lower Realm, it's better. A race might have only one Daofuse cultivator, or none at all, so the impact isn't as significant. But in the Upper Realm, with many Daofuse cultivators, they must spread out. 

Of course, to avoid being defeated one by one, generally, the Daofuse cultivators of a race would gather to establish territories not too far from each other. As long as they can hold on for a while, reinforcements will arrive quickly. 

A few independent ones might choose to establish their territories in less populated areas, reducing competition but increasing danger. 

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun revealed all the information he knew. 

"Six thousand years ago, when we were first defeated, the Daofuse cultivators who retreated to the Upper Realm, along with those who remained, numbered about twenty. 

"Back then, we still organized some counterattacks and even killed some strong experts of the myriad races. 

"Later, five or six Heavenly Kings from the myriad races organized dozens of Daofuse cultivators to hunt us down, leading to the deaths of several top experts. Since then, the Human Race has been unable to counterattack. 

"Over six thousand years ago, the myriad races' territories were clustered together, not daring to spread out. Now, they're more dispersed." 

Marquis Dingjun quickly continued, "The strength of the Dragon Clan here should be similar to the Nether Clan, with about seven Daofuse cultivators. My information isn't as comprehensive as that of Marquis Shadow. The last time I went out was around three thousand years ago. Back then, there weren't as many Daofuse cultivators. The Dragon Clan had five Daofuse cultivators, three of whom were ancient marquises, and the other two advanced later." 

Su Yu interjected, "Heavenly Dragon Marquis is gone, so don't count him." 

"Heavenly Dragon Marquis is gone?" 

Marquis Dingjun remembered this and nodded, "Then there are two ancient marquises, and two who advanced later. If there are more, they must have advanced in the last three thousand years." 

"One is Marquis Golden Dragon, the other is Marquis Blood Dragon." 

Su Yu interjected again, "I know Marquis Dragonblood. Is he related to Marquis Blood Dragon?" 

"Marquis Dragonblood died many years ago. Marquis Blood Dragon is his brother." 

Su Yu nodded. Marquis Dragonblood, the child of destiny in the Death Realm. Your brother is still alive; that's quite fortunate. 

"Do these two ancient marquises have the power of a Heavenly King?" 

"Marquis Golden Dragon does not. His strength is similar to mine, but Marquis Blood Dragon should have it!" 

Marquis Dingjun quickly added, "Marquis Blood Dragon is very talented, so he progressed quickly. He does have the power of a Heavenly King." 

His strength wasn't weak. 

Marquis Dingjun knew of four Daofuse cultivators. In the last three thousand years, a few more should have emerged. 

"Just look at how many territories there are." 

Su Yu said calmly, "It's not a big secret. When a Daofuse cultivator appears, unless it's in the Dao Source Land, everyone should know. Once we reach the Dragon Clan's area, capturing a Dragon Clan member and probing a bit will reveal everything!" 

He didn't ask Marquis Shadow to avoid arousing suspicion. 

A bit of suspicion was necessary. 

Marquis Dingjun quickly added, "Also, be wary of the Phoenix Clan's reinforcements!" 

Marquis Dingjun said solemnly, "The Dragon and Phoenix Clans are inseparable. The Phoenix Clan's territory is very close to the Dragon Clan! The Phoenix Clan's strength is probably not inferior to the Dragon Clan. If the battle drags on and the Phoenix Clan comes to aid, it will be very dangerous!" 

Su Yu nodded. 

He quickly said, "I'm actually worried they won't come to aid. If we kill one and the others don't come but flee instead, what then?" 

Su Yu smiled, "So, I'm thinking about how to catch them all in one net!" 

"Catch them all in one net?" 

Marquis Dingjun inhaled sharply, "How many Daofuse cultivators does Emperor Yu plan to kill this time? Why not kill one and then retreat to avoid being surrounded..." 

Su Yu laughed, "If I only wanted to kill one Daofuse cultivator, why would I bring so many people?" 

"Later, we'll act according to the situation!" 

Su Yu said solemnly, "Lantian will not act initially. He will ambush Marquis Blood Dragon on his way here, striking him midway! Quick battle, quick resolution. When I say retreat, we retreat immediately. No lingering, no prolonged battle!" 

"Great Zhou King, be ready to activate the spatial teleportation at any time!" 

"Great Ming King, set up formations. Remember, make it similar to the West King's Consort's, and leave a mark if possible!" 

"As for Jiuyue and Grandstar..." 

Su Yu glanced at the two. Jiuyue looked at him with a simple expression, while Grandstar appeared eager. Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Jiuyue is skilled in the Dao of Devouring, and Senior Grandstar is skilled in the Dao of the Sword..." 

Grandstar was fine, but Jiuyue's actions were too obvious. 

Especially with his weapon, a large bamboo stick, it was clearly from the Iron Devourer Race. 

After some consideration, Su Yu quickly said, "Jiuyue will be responsible for cleaning up the battlefield. When I say retreat, devour everything in one gulp, whether human or ghost, leave nothing behind!" 

Jiuyue said simply, "Senior Grandstar and I will handle those below Daofuse. The Dragon Clan won't lack Eternals, and even Marquis Dingjun has many under his command, let alone the Dragon Clan." 

That made sense. 

Su Yu nodded, "Alright!" 

Then, Su Yu looked at Marquis Dingjun, "Release your subordinate, Chief Chongming, to join the battle! If the timing is right, let him advance to Daofuse." 

Marquis Dingjun was delighted, "Wouldn't advancing to Daofuse cause too much commotion..." 

"Nonsense, the bigger the commotion, the better!" 

Su Yu quickly made arrangements, deciding to discuss specifics upon arrival. 

A swift battle! 

The key was speed! 

As they flew, Su Yu said, "The foundation of the Human Race in the Upper Realm is gone. Why hide? Come out and ambush the myriad races! Daofuse cultivators are hard to kill, but those below Daofuse aren't! Kill enough of them so that the myriad races' Daofuse cultivators don't dare to leave their homes!" 

Marquis Dingjun sighed, "Ultimately, we still want to preserve some strength. After all... there's still some hope! Ambushing the myriad races' experts isn't impossible, but the risk of falling is greater!" 

Su Yu nodded, "Waiting for Hundred Battle?" 

"Yes." 

At this point, Marquis Dingjun didn't hide anything, "We're waiting for him! The Hundred Battle King is likely sealed near the Dao Source Land! When he was defeated, he might have been ambushed and sealed, not killed. On one hand, the Hundred Battle King is hard to kill. On the other, they feared he would fight to the death and take a few Heavenly Kings with him." 

"How do you know?" 

After the Hundred Battle King's defeat, it was said he disappeared. Why were they so sure he was sealed? 

Marquis Dingjun said solemnly, "Because someone once went to rescue the Hundred Battle King, but failed." 

"Hmm?" 

Su Yu was surprised, "Who?" 

"I don't know." 

"Hmm??" 

Su Yu looked at him suspiciously. Marquis Dingjun explained, "Truly, several thousand years ago, someone went to the Dao Source Land to rescue the Hundred Battle King. On that day, we all sensed the Hundred Battle King's presence, so we are certain he's alive, just sealed! That's why we've been hanging on, surviving until now." 

"You don't know who went to rescue him?" 

Marquis Dingjun shook his head, "Truly don't know. At that time, the Dao Source Land was already lost, the Human Race retreated, but the rescuer was very powerful. I don't know what happened in the end, only that the rescue failed, and the rescuer disappeared. I don't know if they died." 

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "Any distinguishing features?" 

"Distinguishing features?" 

"Since they were strong, you sensed the Hundred Battle King's presence. Did you sense anything from the rescuer?" 

Marquis Dingjun thought for a moment, then shook his head, "No, it was very concealed. It seemed the rescuer set up a large formation to hide their presence, only being discovered midway." 

"Hiding presence?" 

Su Yu looked at the Great Ming King, then at Marquis Dingjun, "Does it resemble the large formation we used against you last time?" 

Marquis Dingjun hesitated, "This... there are many formations to hide presence, they're all similar." 

"Not the same!" 

Su Yu said calmly, "In the Dao Source Land, where the power of laws is dense, setting up a formation quietly requires extraordinary skill and an extraordinary formation!" 

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Interesting!" 

Everyone looked at him. The Great Ming King raised an eyebrow, "Emperor Yu means..." 

Su Yu nodded, "Self-directed play! A show for others!" 

He continued, laughing, "Maybe it wasn't a show, maybe it was serious. Very interesting. If the Hundred Battle King was truly sealed, then the later rescue might have been a show, or a serious attempt to free him. The rescuer and the traitor might be the same group." 

Marquis Dingjun frowned, a bit confused. 

But the Great Zhou King, with a glint in his eye, said, "Emperor Yu means the Hundred Battle King was betrayed by the Control King's lineage, leading to his sealing! Later, the Control King's lineage went to rescue him?" 

Su Yu nodded. 

Marquis Dingjun's face changed, "Impossible, betrayal is possible, but saying he's from the Control King's lineage, I don't believe it!" 

Su Yu felt weary, "Foolish! I didn't say he's from the Control King's lineage! The Control King's lineage betrayed him first, not wanting him to win, causing the Human Race's years of accumulation to be destroyed, and the myriad races to suffer heavy losses! Later, rescuing him was to release him, leading the remaining Human Race to fight the myriad races again, weakening both sides! Otherwise, what's the fun in a one-sided slaughter?" 

Su Yu laughed, "After the Hundred Battle King's defeat, the Human Race lost its great situation. Now, if they can release the Hundred Battle King, he will definitely fight the myriad races to the death again. Even if he dies, he can take down some of the myriad races' experts! And even if the rescue fails, it gives the Human Race a glimmer of hope, preventing complete despair. Isn't that better?"

Marquis Dingjun furrowed his brow and said, "What does Emperor Yu mean by this? I'm a bit confused. If the Control King's lineage betrayed the Human Race, why do they hope for the Human Race's survival? If they want us to survive, they shouldn't have betrayed us."

Su Yu chuckled, "That's not quite it. The Control King's lineage might not want the Human Race to be wiped out, but they also don't want us to become too powerful... Forget it, you wouldn't understand. Warriors don't need to grasp such things."

"......"

There was no response to that.

The others, however, seemed deep in thought.

The Great Zhou King pondered for a moment and said, "So, you're saying that the reason Marquis Dingjun and the others have held out until now might be because the Control King's lineage has been giving them some support, at least enough to keep their spirits up, knowing that the Hundred Battle King is still alive."

"Exactly!"

Su Yu smiled, "Otherwise, if the Human Race were completely annihilated, what would be the point? Tell me, if the Human Race were wiped out, would the myriad races quickly descend into infighting?"

"Unlikely!"

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "The power gap isn't that large. Infighting would lead to mutual destruction, unlike with the Human Race, where it's a blood feud, and one side must die!"

"That's right. If the myriad races had nothing to do, what if they decided to explore Chaos Mountain?"

Su Yu laughed, "So, they need to keep the Human Race from being destroyed. In fact, the Control King's lineage's goal isn't to see the Human Race wiped out but rather, like the Martial Emperor, to establish their own version of the Human Race!"

Su Yu's eyes gleamed, "Back then, when the Silk Destroying King's father entered the Human Realm, there were few strong individuals. He didn't know about your existence, Great Zhou King, but did he slaughter the Human Race?"

"No!"

The Great Zhou King shook his head.

"Did the Silk Destroying King slaughter the Human Race?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and shook his head again.

"What about the West King's Consort?"

Su Yu smiled, "Did the West King's Consort slaughter the Human Race?"

She didn't either!

Su Yu sneered, "Their goal is to deal with the legacies and contingencies of some ancient powerhouses. As for ordinary humans, they're not their targets. They aim to eliminate the influence of ancient powerhouses and recreate the Human Race!"

At this moment, Su Yu finally understood the true goal of the Control King's lineage.

Few knew of their betrayal, and it was only in Su Yu's generation that these matters came to light.

Was it betrayal?

Perhaps it wasn't a betrayal of the Human Race but rather a betrayal of the ancients, a betrayal of the Human Emperor, and a betrayal of the Culture King and others.

The Control King and the Martial Emperor were quite similar!

Both were suppressed by the ancient Human Race powerhouses. The Martial Emperor was sealed and could only fume helplessly.

But the Control King's lineage truly retaliated against those ancient powerhouses.

They even harbored ambitions to unify the myriad realms, so when they saw the Hundred Battle King gaining an advantage, they launched an attack, leading to the Hundred Battle King's defeat and the fall of the Human Race's powerhouses.

Because they didn't want to see the legacy of the Hundred Battle King and those ancient powerhouses win again.

Rescuing the Hundred Battle King was also a way to ensure the Human Race didn't perish too quickly.

"They really see themselves as the masters of fate!"

Su Yu laughed, "But their methods are indeed high-level! For so many years, almost no one noticed. It's only in this era that they feel there's nothing left to hide, so they've revealed some clues!"

"Let's not talk about this for now!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he sneered, "I don't believe that in 100,000 years, they left no traces. It's just that no one paid attention, and it was covered up! Even if no one cared before, 6,000 years ago, when the Hundred Battle King was sealed, I don't believe the myriad races knew nothing!"

"This lineage won't be able to hide for much longer!"

"The West King's Consort even went directly to the Death Realm, clearly showing no intention to hide anymore, satisfying their demands!"

"Some of the old relics among the myriad races must know something!"

"......"

Marquis Dingjun didn't quite understand, glancing at Jiuyue and Grandstar, who were listening intently, and once again questioned his life choices.

Of course, he generally understood that Su Yu was talking about the Control King's lineage.

But was this lineage really that strong?

Well, he hadn't paid much attention.

As an ancient marquis, he thought he understood these matters well enough.

When Su Yu finished speaking, he interjected, "The Control King's lineage doesn't seem to have many strong individuals. They disappeared along with the ancients... Well, except for the Martial King's lineage, which left the strongest contingencies!"

He sighed, "The first tide was led by the Martial King's son, and we fought fiercely, killing many!"

Enough with that!

Su Yu rolled his eyes, and the Great Zhou King awkwardly said, "Uh, let's not praise the Martial King!"

There's no need!

The Martial King's contingencies, are those really contingencies?

He left behind a powerful son; does that count as a contingency?

Maybe?

Anyway, during the first tide, the Martial King's son was quite formidable, leading several marquises and killing many of the myriad races' marquises.

That was the Martial King's contingency!

Of course, in the eyes of others, it was indeed impressive. The Culture King left behind pen, ink, paper, and inkstone, but no one obtained them.

The Radiant King left nothing.

The Control King was the same.

The Human Emperor, it seemed, left nothing either, only later was it discovered that he left behind the Torchbearer.

In comparison, the Martial King was truly impressive!

The Martial King himself was formidable, and his son was also powerful. The first tide was so fierce, though he died quickly.

In reality, from Su Yu's perspective, except for the Radiant King, who left nothing, everyone else had far more sophisticated methods than the Martial King.

Marquis Dingjun said no more.

He was exhausted; the world was so hostile to warriors. What's wrong with being a warrior?

The Martial King did leave behind a formidable contingency, his son, who was indeed fierce, strong, and powerful, though he died quickly. But the first tide was fought fiercely, killing many of the myriad races' marquises.

...

After Marquis Dingjun mentioned the Martial King, everyone fell silent.

They continued to rush forward, and soon, in the distance, ancient and massive cities appeared before Su Yu and his companions.

Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate.

He looked northward.

In the void, he seemed to see giant dragons roaring!

At the northern end, Su Yu seemed to see a blood dragon roaring at the heavens and earth!

"Blood Dragon Marquis?"

Su Yu's heart stirred, and he quickly avoided that path's shadow.

With his Heaven Gate open, he was best suited to observe enemy movements!

Unless someone was accustomed to hiding their path's power, they couldn't escape his Heaven Gate. Normally, a Daofuse cultivator wouldn't retract their path's power unless in deep slumber.

After all, no one could see it.

At this moment, Su Yu quickly scanned the entire northern land, where nine massive dragon cities stood!

Arranged like a giant dragon!

And the Blood Dragon Marquis was at the dragon's head.

Beyond that, several other massive dragon cities extended to the sides.

Like a soaring dragon!

Reaching the north, the dragon territory, dragon aura permeated the air, and the power of the paths seemed infused with the dragon race's essence, as did the source qi.

The abundant dragon aura even formed into small dragons.

Su Yu scanned each one, "Nine dragon cities, seven occupied, one should belong to the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, and the other is either dead or absent."

Seven Daofuse cultivators!

Just like the Nether Race.

Su Yu didn't linger on the Blood Dragon Marquis's direction but looked toward the dragon's body. After a while, he quickly said, "Including the Blood Dragon Marquis, seven Daofuse cultivators! Of course, it's possible some are in slumber, which is hard to observe!"

"Seven, one at the Heavenly King level! That Golden Dragon Marquis isn't weak either, purely from the path's power, it's a top-tier Daofuse! Second-tier Daofuse! The other five Daofuse, one third-tier, one fourth-tier, and the remaining three are fifth-tier Daofuse!"

Su Yu laughed, "The dragon race is indeed strong! If the Heavenly Dragon Marquis is present, they're also around third-tier, and the dragon race had a fallen Dragon Emperor with around fourth-tier strength."

Such strength is truly formidable.

A Heavenly King leading several Daofuse cultivators.

Stronger than the Human Race in the Upper Realm!

Su Yu didn't stay long and quickly flew in another direction. After about 20 minutes, he stopped and looked in another direction, where a phoenix was poised to fly!

The phoenix territory, Phoenix City!

Su Yu also looked toward Phoenix City, marveling, "Impressive, comparable to the dragon race's strength! The phoenix head is near the dragon tail! The phoenix head should be where the phoenix's Heavenly King level is located. From the phoenix head to the dragon tail, it takes about 10 minutes, speaking for myself."

Su Yu looked at Lantian, "How long would it take you, at full speed, to get from the phoenix head to the dragon tail?"

Lantian calculated and said, "A bit faster than you, definitely within eight minutes!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King, "How long would it take you to teleport from the phoenix head to the dragon tail?"

"One minute!"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "The distance is still a bit far, but one minute is enough."

Su Yu said seriously, "Do you think the phoenix race has anyone skilled in spatial teleportation?"

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "This race isn't adept at teleportation! Most likely, they don't have anyone, but of course, there's always a chance!"

He continued, "Besides Lantian, going to the dragon head, I think we shouldn't split up, but act together! Quick and decisive, kill one, and quickly teleport to the next dragon city!"

The Great Zhou King assessed, "Each dragon city is about 5,000 miles apart. Without teleportation, just flying or tearing through the void would take at least 30 seconds! But with teleportation, I can get everyone to the next dragon city within 3 seconds!"

Tearing through the void, a Daofuse cultivator could travel about a hundred miles per second, not too fast.

Riding the River of Time would be faster.

The key is, this isn't the Dao Source Land, where the River of Time isn't apparent.

Here, spatial teleportation is faster.

In the Upper Realm, traveling isn't as fast as in the Lower Realm, where one can use the River of Time's power to instantly reach a place.

Last time Su Yu started a battle, the Nether Emperor and others, in dozens of seconds, followed the River of Time from various realms to the Human Realm, covering hundreds of thousands of miles, much farther than this.

Here, spatial teleportation is more effective than in the outside world.

Conveniently, the Great Zhou King excels at it.

In fact, Lantian and Su Yu both know teleportation, having dabbled in the space path.

Su Yu quickly calculated, "The dragon race has seven Daofuse cultivators, excluding the Blood Dragon Marquis, six! Can we finish the battle in three minutes?"

Everyone looked at him, taking a deep breath.

Within three minutes!

Su Yu spoke in a deep voice, "Perhaps we need to be faster. There's a chance that other races have experts skilled in teleportation who might intercept us. If we're delayed, we'll be in big trouble!"

Lantian quickly responded, "Then I'll go entangle Marquis Blood Dragon. The most troublesome one left is Marquis Golden Dragon. How about we deal with him first? Once he's taken care of, the remaining five won't be able to escape easily!"

Su Yu glanced around and quickly said, "Great Zhou King, you'll act with me! Great Ming King, September, Marquis Dingjun, Grandstar, and Chongming, the five of you, with Great Ming King setting up a formation to entangle Marquis Golden Dragon. Can you manage that?"

Marquis Dingjun was speechless. "The five of us together can't handle Marquis Golden Dragon?"

Who are you underestimating!

He felt that Su Yu was looking down on him.

Su Yu coldly said, "The others have just advanced, and Chongming hasn't even advanced yet. Marquis Dingjun, you used to be cautious. What, are you getting complacent now? Marquis Golden Dragon's combat strength surpasses yours. You haven't progressed over the years, but he has! Your sole purpose is to entangle him! The Great Zhou King and I will swiftly deal with the other four Daofuse Realm experts and then surround him, finally taking down Marquis Blood Dragon!"

After speaking, Su Yu sternly added, "If you can't hold him or suffer casualties, you're the strongest among us. I'll have you bring your head to me, understood?"

Marquis Dingjun's heart trembled, and he hurriedly said, "Understood!"

He indeed felt that Su Yu underestimated him because he had fought Marquis Golden Dragon in the past. While he hadn't won, he hadn't lost either. But Su Yu pointed out that Marquis Golden Dragon was considered a second-tier Daofuse Realm expert, while Marquis Dingjun was rated as third-tier. Clearly, Marquis Golden Dragon had made significant progress over the millennia.

Su Yu snorted, "If you ruin my plans, there won't be a good outcome for you! I'm not looking to fight a battle where we harm the enemy a thousand times but suffer eight hundred times ourselves!"

"I want a complete victory!"

"I want to strike with overwhelming force, killing seven Daofuse Realm experts without losing three or four of our own. Only an idiot would do that!"

Su Yu coldly continued, "This is our first battle together! If you don't perform well, get lost and go bother the Hundred Battle King. Don't follow me; I don't need useless and disobedient people!"

Marquis Dingjun smiled bitterly. This... was quite a blow to his self-esteem. He felt rejected!

Su Yu ignored him and turned to the Great Zhou King. "Our goal is to kill from the dragon's tail to the dragon's head, quickly! So fast that they can't react. Go all out, as fast as possible, even if it means getting injured!"

"Understood!"

The Great Zhou King nodded quickly, speaking in a deep voice, "Don't worry, both of us are skilled at concealing our presence and blocking heavenly secrets. Killing a few fourth or fifth-tier Daofuse Realm experts won't be difficult!"

Su Yu smiled. He preferred working with people like the Great Zhou King. They were straightforward, making cooperation enjoyable. Warriors... they were really troublesome. They could only fight head-on. They weren't good at ambushes, concealing their aura, teleportation, or sealing... they were useless except for fighting.

Su Yu silently complained in his heart. You guys should be able to entangle a second-tier Daofuse Realm expert together!

"Now, head to the dragon's neck. Lantian will ambush near the dragon's head..."

Su Yu checked the time and quickly said, "In ten minutes, we'll act together!"

"Remember, your main task is to entangle, not to kill!"

Su Yu emphasized, "The goal is to entangle! Also, Lantian, you're still new to the path and might not be a match for that guy. If you really can't handle it, just hold on for a moment, and we'll come to help. You don't have to wait until we've killed those Daofuse Realm experts!"

Lantian chuckled, "Got it."

Suddenly, Lantian transformed into a little girl, giggling, "Emperor Yu is so nice!"

Then, she turned into a young woman, with a hint of grievance, "Emperor Yu doesn't trust me."

"..."

Crazy!

I'm talking business here.

Su Yu kept a straight face, and Lantian quickly transformed into an old man with a white beard, looking serious, "Understood!"

These transformations made Marquis Dingjun click his tongue in wonder. Impressive! The lower realm has produced several freaks.

"Disperse. Great Ming King, set up a formation to conceal their presence!"

"Understood!"

Quickly, the group split into three. Lantian headed to the dragon's head, they went to the dragon's neck, and Su Yu and the Great Zhou King swiftly concealed their presence, blocking heavenly secrets, and flew towards the dragon's tail.

Over there was also a fifth-tier Daofuse Realm expert's domain. Fifth-tier was just the standard level for newly advanced Daofuse Realm experts, slightly stronger than those who had just fused their three bodies.

The Great Zhou King was close to the first-tier Heavenly King Realm, and Su Yu was at the second-tier Daofuse Realm. Either of them could easily crush the opponent.

The two concealed their aura. Su Yu activated his divine character, and the Great Zhou King also pushed his divine character to the limit. At this moment, he even had the leisure to transmit his voice to Su Yu, smiling, "Emperor Yu, this is the first time we've teamed up alone, isn't it?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. It really was!

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Let's see how well we cooperate. Lantian is strong, but I feel he's too laid-back. He's fine in solo combat, but cooperation might be more challenging."

Su Yu smiled and said nothing.

At this moment, the sky had just turned dark. Of course, for Su Yu and the others, there was no difference between day and night. It was all the same.

Gradually, the two flew near a dragon city. From a distance, they saw the massive city gate with two floating words above it—Dragon Extinction!

Su Yu smiled.

The Great Zhou King also smiled and transmitted his voice, "What a fitting name, Dragon Extinction. Let's fulfill it! We're about three hundred miles away. Teleporting there will only take a moment!"

Su Yu nodded.

Without saying a word, a small stone appeared in his hand. The Great Zhou King looked at him, and Su Yu said nothing.

A fifth-tier Daofuse Realm expert could still be suppressed.

Instant suppression, the Great Zhou King's endurance path erupted, making it not difficult to kill the opponent.

Su Yu suddenly asked, "Don't you have any offensive dao power?"

The Great Zhou King... wasn't good at attacking?

The Great Zhou King smiled, remained silent for a while, and transmitted his voice, "I do, but not at the Daofuse level. Daofuse... isn't that simple!"

He had offensive skills, but they hadn't reached the Daofuse level.

Su Yu frowned, "That's quite a flaw."

"I'm not seeking to be all-powerful!"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "A person's energy is limited. Not everyone is like Emperor Yu. From ancient times to now, I've always focused on two paths: endurance and stillness! The endurance path has broken through to Daofuse, but the stillness path is still lacking. My next goal is to break through the stillness path. This way, even if Daofuse experts discover me, they'll have to endure..."

Su Yu laughed, "The third path, the space path! This way, if a Heavenly King discovers you and wants to kill you, you can instantly escape, endure, conceal your aura, and teleport away... The Great Zhou King's path is quite interesting."

A complete set of sneaky paths!

Anyway, he didn't have any strong offensive dao power.

Of course, all dao powers were strong. Although the Great Zhou King wasn't good at it, it didn't mean he couldn't attack with other dao powers. It just meant he would be weaker compared to other experts of the same level.

The Great Zhou King smiled and remained silent.

Living long was the real victory.

Look, I've lived long enough to see hope, haven't I?

Time passed little by little.

The agreed ten minutes quickly arrived.

There was no shouting, no roaring, only a silent space crack appearing, and the two stepped in, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Even when they teleported above the dragon city, it was utterly silent.

In the dragon city, a Daofuse Realm expert suddenly opened his eyes.

His massive body floated up instantly, carrying a hint of fear. What was happening?

Suddenly, he felt a sense of danger!

And at that moment, two people suddenly appeared above his head. Even then, they were silent. Su Yu didn't shout, and the Great Zhou King was eerily quiet.

However, from the dragon's neck, a sudden surge of dao power erupted.

Dragon Extinction suddenly looked over, surprised. Something happened over at Marquis Golden Dragon's side?

Scared me to death. I thought something happened on my side!

Marquis Golden Dragon was strong and close to Marquis Blood Dragon, so he wasn't too worried. He was just puzzled. Who would provoke Marquis Golden Dragon?

Are they crazy!

At this moment, above him, Su Yu held a stone and, with the fastest and strongest speed, hurled it at Dragon Extinction!

The Great Zhou King's endurance path was pushed to the limit.

Little guy, endure and don't move!

This time, he didn't make a sound.

Everyone was aiming for a sneak attack, so they had to keep it low-key.

What if someone heard them if they shouted?

Dragon Extinction sensed something above him and wanted to look up, but suddenly, thoughts appeared in his mind: endure, don't move, don't look, just stay still.

"Don't move?"

Dragon Extinction was in a daze. Why not move?

There seemed to be danger above me. Why am I not moving?

If I don't move, will nothing happen?

Bang!

A loud noise erupted. The massive dragon head was directly shattered by the small stone. The dao was instantly suppressed by the stone. Su Yu's fist, carrying a trace of chaotic energy, struck out!

Boom!

The dao was shattered by his punch. Su Yu remained silent, breaking the dao power with a punch, and then poked a finger into the shattered dragon head, piercing the sea of will!

The Mark of Civilization appeared, sweeping across.

A space channel opened, and the Great Zhou King, sweating, instantly teleported with Su Yu to the second city.

Only after they left did the sound reach the area where Dragon Extinction was, and suddenly, a thunderous sound erupted!

A surge of dao power instantly spread out.

In Dragon Extinction's dao palace, some Eternal experts flew out, bewildered.

What happened?

They looked around, not seeing Dragon Extinction's body because Su Yu had taken it. They only saw a sudden surge of dao power in the dao palace, each of them looking extremely puzzled.

A dragon clan member curiously asked, "This isn't a source of dao. Why is there so much overflowing power of laws? Could it be... is this place about to produce an unowned dao of laws?"

Instantly, a group of Eternal experts was overjoyed.

No way!

This isn't a source of dao.

But... why did so much overflowing power of laws suddenly appear here?

In the Upper Realm, when a Daofuse cultivator falls, there are no ominous blood clouds, but the dispersal of the power of laws is immense, making it hard to discern whether someone has died or not unless one pays close attention.

A group of powerful dragons soared into the sky, one of them exclaiming joyfully, "Perhaps it's truly an unclaimed path of laws. Where is the Dao Master?"

Why hasn't the Dao Master appeared? The commotion is so significant, comparable to the fall of a Daofuse cultivator, yet the Dao Master hasn't emerged. Is he in seclusion?

Surely not!

Just then, in the nearest dragon city to this one, a formidable dragon suddenly appeared, its voice filled with confusion and fear as it roared, "Who? Who killed Longmie?"

"......"

The voice quickly spread, and moments later, it reached Longmie's Dao Field. The dragons, who were still puzzled about the Dao Master's absence, suddenly froze.

What?

The Dao Master is dead?

Don't joke around; we didn't sense anything.

At this moment, some Eternals looked up at the sky, then back down, stunned.

This massive disturbance is indeed similar to the fall of a Daofuse cultivator. Don't tell us it's true—the Dao Master... is dead?

A dragon stammered, "Impossible... we're all here, and there was no sign. How could the Dao Master possibly... die..."

Just then, an earth-shattering roar echoed!

The gigantic dragon that had been roaring moments ago, its enormous figure suspended in the air, suddenly had a fist smash down on its head!

Boom!

The deafening explosion wasn't concealed this time. The people in the second dragon city, as well as the Eternals in Longmie's Dao Field, all saw it. They saw the massive dragon head shatter in an instant!

Immediately after, a palm covered the sky, and with a bang, the sea of will was obliterated!

The second dragon's corpse fell, but before it could hit the ground, it vanished in an instant.

In the blink of an eye, that dragon was gone!

The second dragon was killed in an instant!

In about ten seconds, two Daofuse cultivators had fallen.

The experts from both Dao Fields were dumbfounded.

At this moment, in the skies above the third, fourth, and fifth dragon cities, enormous dragons appeared, all of them dazed, terrified, and panicked.

In an instant, two Daofuse cultivators were killed!

And just then, a thunderous roar erupted. A blood dragon flew out from the massive city at the dragon's head, rushing towards the Golden Dragon Marquis. But just as it flew out, a giant palm appeared below, slapping the blood dragon tens of thousands of meters into the air, with large droplets of blood raining down.

"Damn it!"

At this moment, the entire dragon city region heard the furious roar of the Blood Dragon Marquis.

"Enemy attack!"

The Blood Dragon Marquis roared violently!

The sound reverberated in all directions, and only now did the dragons realize they were under attack.

Moreover, it was extremely dangerous.

Two Daofuse cultivators had died, the Blood Dragon Marquis was ambushed, and the Golden Dragon Marquis was entangled. The attackers were powerful, possibly at the quasi-king level!

"Enemy attack!"

Countless roars echoed, but the three dragons that hadn't yet encountered strong enemies didn't know where to go!

Where should they go?

The dragon's tail or the dragon's head?

The third dragon didn't need to think because, at that moment, two figures appeared before it. It wanted to roar, to bellow, but no sound came out.

Boom!

Su Yu, like a mad demon, launched a frenzied assault!

Countless chaotic auras erupted, turning the sky and earth into chaos, dragon blood splattering everywhere.

After about thirty seconds of relentless assault, with a thunderous explosion, the third dragon was smashed into a pulp.

The great path shattered!

Fallen!

In forty seconds, the third Daofuse cultivator had fallen!

The remaining two dragons without opponents were still preparing to come to the rescue. Halfway there, they suddenly turned and fled!

Madness!

Two top-tier Daofuse cultivators!

The two dragons were utterly terrified. Who was attacking the dragon clan?

In the blink of an eye, three Daofuse cultivators were dead!

In the distance, the Blood Dragon Marquis roared fiercely, "Run, flee quickly!"

Unbeatable!

The three Daofuse cultivators had fallen too quickly. The invading enemy was incredibly powerful, unbeatable!

He had to escape too!
