Chapter 860: Who Does Heaven Favor? (Requesting Subscriptions)

"Hu!"

Su Yu exhaled heavily, retreating back to the defensive zone. Across from him, the myriad races' experts also breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Exhausted!

The battle, the most intense of battles, was draining everyone's energy, spirit, and vitality. While source qi and the power of the Great Dao remained, the relentless combat, where life and death were decided in an instant, left everyone utterly fatigued.

...

"Madman!"

Even the battle-hardened Demon Emperor couldn't help but curse under his breath.

Su Yu—today, everyone had etched this name into their minds, never to be forgotten.

The Divine Emperor, also breathing heavily, wore a grave expression. "Is he always like this, or does he have some ulterior motive? We've fought so many times today, and both sides have suffered significant losses. What does he gain from this?"

It was still incomprehensible!

A battle where both sides suffer—what's the point, even if you integrate them into your Su Yu's world? Initially, they won't have much combat power, and these heavily injured individuals will need time to recover.

Everyone had told Su Yu that the Three Gates would open, and countless powerful beings would emerge. Yet, he continued to fight like this. Was he insane?

Beside him, several experts from the myriad races were equally helpless. One of them, panting, said, "This lunatic... are his subordinates mad too? At this rate, they'll all die in battle!"

The myriad races still held a slight advantage.

At this moment, the Immortal Emperor transmitted a message: "Target Su Yu, capture them all in one fell swoop! I've figured it out—his subordinates' Daos are completely connected to his world. If Su Yu is killed... all his people will die! I checked, there are over 30 rulers of laws, including the Martial Emperor, all within Su Yu's world!"

Previously, they hadn't been clear on how many rulers of laws were born within Su Yu's world.

But after the fierce battle, the Immortal Emperor had discerned it.

Now, with an extremely peculiar look in his eyes, he said, "Kill Su Yu, and over thirty rulers of laws will either die or be crippled! This could break the current stalemate in one move!"

The Divine Emperor's heart trembled, and he transmitted back, "Are you sure that over thirty of them were born in his world?"

"All of them!"

Even the Divine Emperor couldn't help but be shocked. "This madman, hasn't he considered that by doing this, he becomes the primary target for his enemies? Killing him would be equivalent to killing over thirty rulers of laws?"

This point had not been apparent before.

Su Yu's world covered a vast area, and its power was dispersed. With so many rulers of laws, they had assumed that only a few were born within Su Yu's world.

But now, the Immortal Emperor told them it was all of them!

This was an extremely terrifying revelation!

However, for the myriad races, this was a tremendous opportunity. Killing Su Yu would mean the complete downfall of all those he brought with him!

"Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?"

The Demon Emperor also asked, as this was crucial. If they were wrong and paid a heavy price to kill Su Yu, it would instead give the human race an opportunity. If they lost a few first-class or multiple rulers of laws because of Su Yu, it would definitely not be worth it.

But if sacrificing a few rulers of laws meant killing Su Yu and simultaneously taking down so many rulers of laws, it would all be worth it!

The Immortal Emperor was quite certain. He had indeed seen it, but he knew everyone wanted an extremely definite answer!

After a moment of silence, the Immortal Emperor transmitted, "One hundred percent! I am certain, except for the two from the Chaos Race, the others, after careful observation, should all be connected to his world!"

The Divine Emperor's tone was somewhat unusual, "If what you say is true... then killing Su Yu..."

The few of them exchanged glances, their eyes flickering with thoughts.

Su Yu was also a first-class.

Killing Su Yu would be very difficult.

However, if they were willing to pay the price, it was definitely possible.

The Divine Emperor, having fought with him for a long time, understood Su Yu's situation and transmitted, "He possesses about 20 paths of power, similar to me, making him one of the top in the first-class!"

"But he has the enhancement of his own world; otherwise, he wouldn't be this strong!"

"I, the Immortal Emperor, and the Demon Emperor are all at this level. The Dragon and Phoenix are slightly weaker... Among the humans, not to mention the Human Emperor, the Radiant King is the strongest, probably exceeding 22 paths of power!"

The Radiant King was stronger than them, but he wasn't adept at combat. His forte was formations, often fighting two-on-one against the Dragon and Phoenix.

If not for the Radiant King, Su Yu's side, without the Book Spirit and King Yue's outburst, would actually be weaker in first-class combat power. But with the Radiant King, the gap was almost bridged.

Dealing with the Radiant King was difficult, and dealing with Su Yu was also challenging... but whether it was worth it depended on the value!

The three of them exchanged glances, each lost in thought.

The Immortal Emperor had observed for a long time and finally obtained an extremely useful piece of information.

But at this moment, they couldn't make up their minds.

The Divine Emperor wanted the Demon Emperor to take the risk, the Demon Emperor wanted the Divine Emperor to fight, and the Immortal Emperor didn't want to face Su Yu alone... This was the current state of the myriad races.

Unless there was a catalyst!

A catalyst to change everything!

This catalyst required everyone to feel an absolute sense of crisis, forcing them to risk their lives!

But currently, Su Yu's side hadn't brought the myriad races to the brink of extinction.

...

On the other side.

Su Yu gazed at the sky, lost in thought.

He looked towards the myriad races and suddenly spoke, "Do you think the myriad races have techniques to spy on the Great Dao?"

The Radiant King looked at him suspiciously and nodded, "They do, but nothing as clear as the Heaven Gate!"

Su Yu nodded.

Ever since he had a conversation with the Human Emperor, who mentioned that the top figures among the myriad races were ruthless and might take a risk at a critical moment, Su Yu had been pondering.

Of course, while pondering, he also revealed some of the Great Daos within his world, making them faintly visible.

That's right!

Su Yu was deliberately exposing them. He didn't know if the other side had noticed, but it was quite possible, given the myriad races' experts had many tricks up their sleeves.

He was fishing!

Fishing for a very big fish!

The kind that might end up eating him!

"Have they noticed?"

Su Yu looked towards the myriad races. If they had noticed... the Human Emperor severing the Dao, integrating into the world, and presenting a crisis might prompt the myriad races to take a risk.

Rather than letting the myriad races think of all sorts of possibilities, it was better to lure them to his side, avoiding excessive casualties.

But in doing so, Su Yu would face significant trouble.

Su Yu closed his eyes.

The fish might have taken the bait!

But whether the fish would eat him or he would eat the fish was uncertain.

Daring to fish naturally meant having some confidence. Without any confidence, Su Yu wouldn't take such a risk. But nothing could be achieved with absolute certainty. With a fifty percent chance, it was worth a gamble!

And this fifty percent, thirty percent was within the Heaven Gate!

At this moment, Su Yu closed his eyes, seemingly resting.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. My heavens, you're finally tired!

...

In reality, Su Yu was communicating with someone within the Heaven Gate.

Gui!

Su Yu discovered that the flow of time within the Heaven Gate might be similar to the upper reaches of the River of Time, or even faster. A day in the River of Time, and several days might have passed there.

Whether this was true or not, he wasn't sure.

In fact, at this level, people rarely cared about minor discrepancies in time flow.

A year and ten years, sometimes, were not much different, just like with Hongmeng.

And Gui, who had been doing something unknown these past few days, had been quite efficient. At this moment, Gui actively contacted Su Yu.

His friends had arrived!

This was Su Yu's opportunity.

An opportunity to fish and eat the fish.

It was risky, but Su Yu wanted to try. If it didn't work, he still had one last resort... the Culture King!

However, that would create a crisis for the Culture King.

Including Su Yu, it would also create some crisis.

But at this moment, Su Yu didn't care about these things. To quickly defeat the myriad races, without external support, if something went wrong on the Human Emperor's side, Su Yu might be devoured by the myriad races. At that point, he would have to flee to the Myriad Realms.

Opening the Three Gates all at once!

Suppressing them here was essentially suppressing the Three Gates.

"Su Yu, some of my friends and subordinates have arrived. You see, you promised me before that you would help them channel some power..."

Gui was a bit apprehensive. You won't go back on your word, right?

Su Yu laughed, "How many?"

"Not many, five!"

Gui didn't dare to make a big announcement. That would give top experts a chance to kill him. He didn't want to lose this opportunity and hand over the Su Yu connection to others.

"Five?"

Su Yu calculated, "What are their strengths?"

"Average..."

Gui, fearing Su Yu's concern, explained, "They're all what you call third or fourth class, just two to seven paths of power..."

Su Yu laughed, nonsense!

Do you think I believe that?

You, Gui, are at least first-class. The friends you find, if not first-class, are definitely second-class.

You wouldn't dare find someone too strong, but they might be of comparable strength, not too weak either.

"Counting you, six?"

"Yes!"

That meant at least one first-class, and the remaining five, assuming they were all second-class, one first-class and five second-class...

However, those five might not be able to descend in person, but Gui could probably descend in person now, right?

Yet Gui was a variable.

Once out, he might not necessarily listen to Su Yu.

"Power of the physical Dao..."

Gui cultivated the physical Dao, a first-class physical Dao.

The physical Dao within the Gate!

Su Yu suddenly looked at the Martial Emperor not far away. The Martial Emperor awkwardly turned his head, not wanting to look at Su Yu. On one hand, he was quite pleased, having daily battles and being under Su Yu's protection, not even fearing the Human Emperor.

But on the other hand, he was troubled, as Su Yu restricted him, and he had integrated into Su Yu's world, which was quite unpleasant!

And just as he was feeling awkward, Su Yu suddenly transmitted, "If you reached first-class, would you dare to risk your life to help me kill a first-class expert?"

"Hmm?"

The Martial Emperor instantly looked at Su Yu, what did he mean?

I can't reach first-class!

You're only first-class, and the world has its limits. This reasoning, the Martial Emperor understood very well.

Su Yu looked at him and repeated, "Do you dare?"

The Martial Emperor's voice was cold as he transmitted his thoughts, "Why test me? My life and death are in your hands, Su Yu. There's no need to test me!"

Su Yu repeated once more, "Do you dare?"

The Martial Emperor was a bit annoyed and angry, transmitting back, "What are you trying to say? Even if I reach the first tier, you might already be beyond that... In your world, can I still overturn the heavens?"

He was extremely frustrated!

Su Yu transmitted, "No, breaking the shackles isn't impossible! I once promised you that I would find a way to help you improve! If I integrate a complete first-tier path into your Great Dao... Under normal circumstances, you wouldn't be able to break through to the first tier! However, this path is also a physical path and can complement your physical path with yin and yang, giving you hope to break this shackle!"

The Martial Emperor's eyes shifted slightly as he looked at Su Yu, transmitting, "What do you mean?"

"I want to help you break through to the first tier... But such a great gain must come with a price! You need to help me fight a first-tier expert! It might be the Immortal Emperor, the Demon Emperor, or someone else..."

The Martial Emperor's heart pounded!

First tier?

When he emerged, he was only at the peak of the third tier, with the power of seven paths. By now, he had almost reached the power of over ten paths, progressing so quickly that even he was afraid.

He had never advanced so rapidly before!

Now, Su Yu was telling him that he could help him reach the first tier.

Taishan!

Even though he was influenced by the Human Emperor's Great Dao, he still held grudges. Taishan's wife was a first-tier expert, and the Suppressing Martial King wasn't much weaker than Su Yu, possessing at least the power of eighteen paths.

He couldn't even defeat the Martial King's wife, and the Martial King's second wife might be even stronger than him.

Moreover, the Martial King had nine wives still alive!

His hope for revenge was extremely slim.

At this moment, he was tempted.

Su Yu continued, "You once said you owed me five rulers of laws... You haven't repaid that debt. How about trying it? Consider it as one of your slots?"

The Martial Emperor was silent for a moment, then transmitted, "You... you can really help me reach the first tier?"

"Stop talking nonsense. Don't be wishy-washy. When I, Su Yu, say something, it's never false! Of course, it's not a hundred percent, but there's a good chance. Once you enter, whether you can kill a first-tier expert, at any cost, even if you might die just after entering the first tier!"

The Martial Emperor closed his eyes, and after a while, transmitted, "Alright! Any cost is fine! Having hope is better than having none! I want to take revenge on Taishan, but after tens of thousands of years... I know I have no hope! But I'm not willing to accept it! I want to defeat him!"

Su Yu nodded, transmitting, "Consider it agreed. As for who to fight, we'll see the situation then!"

"Alright!"

The Martial Emperor agreed, his face solemn.

Advancement, killing!

At this moment, he no longer cared about anything else. He wanted to advance!

"Great Zhou King!"

Su Yu continued to transmit. The Great Zhou King's eyes moved as he looked at Su Yu. Su Yu calmly said, "The Human Emperor is merging paths, cutting off those people's paths. See if there's a chance for other Great Daos to break through to the first tier! Regardless of whether there is or not... you need to help me entangle a first-tier expert. Remember, even if you die, the opponent must not escape. Can you do it?"

The Great Zhou King licked his lips, smiled, and transmitted, "Alright!"

Su Yu nodded calmly, then looked at the third and fourth persons, "King Yue, Book Spirit, without my permission, do not borrow the power of the Culture King's world... Until the critical moment, you two just need to entangle a first-tier expert. If I need it... you two need to borrow power, either to kill a first-tier expert or to entangle two first-tier experts!"

The two powerful beings looked at Su Yu, somewhat solemn, and nodded almost imperceptibly.

Su Yu calculated that with this arrangement, the Martial Emperor, Great Zhou King, Book Spirit, and King Yue might be used as four first-tier experts.

As for the Radiant King and others, Su Yu didn't arrange anything, not even greeting them. If the Myriad Races were to deal with him, they would definitely focus on these three first-tier experts and pay a considerable price to take them away!

However, neither the Martial Emperor nor the Great Zhou King was a hundred percent reliable.

This was the crisis!

As for Gui, should he be killed directly, or what?

When should Gui appear?

If he appears now and kills a first-tier expert, the commotion would be too great!

The Myriad Races would immediately know that something had changed!

At this moment, Gui's voice came again, somewhat impatient, "Su Yu, my friend is lending you power, guide it..."

Su Yu took a deep breath. Are you that eager to die?

Are you so eager to seek death?

But if you resist desperately, not only will you fail to obtain the complete Great Dao, but unexpected changes might occur. Would you willingly hand over your Great Dao power?

Also, how can I make you descend?

Su Yu thought to himself and suddenly said, "Gui... don't bother me. My formidable enemy has come for me! It's very troublesome!"

At this moment, Gui's avatar also sensed that some turbulence had appeared in the Myriad Realms!

"A formidable enemy has come?"

Gui hurriedly said, "You won't be in trouble, will you?"

At this critical moment, don't die!

If you die and the Heaven Gate closes, that would be troublesome.

If it doesn't work... should I descend now?

But I'm not prepared. Descending now isn't the best time, but Gui could feel that he could descend now!

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "I don't know, but I'm not afraid! If I die, then so be it. What's there to fear!"

"Don't... you should escape..."

"Heh, would I, Su Yu, escape?"

Gui was speechless. Nonsense, if you're really in danger, wouldn't you run instead of waiting to die?

He was very anxious!

If you're really about to die, then I must seize this opportunity to descend into the Myriad Realms.

Otherwise, where would I find another fool like you?

Su Yu pondered for a moment and then said, "Gui, are you afraid of death?"

Gui was stunned. Nonsense!

"Heh, no one can kill me!"

Gui gave an ambiguous answer!

Su Yu chuckled, "I just wanted to ask, when faced with life and death, if you had to choose between losing power or dying, what would you choose?"

Gui was a bit anxious, "Su Yu, why not first accept my friend's power?"

He didn't want to answer this question.

Su Yu said softly, "No, you answer me first! Because... I might be facing death. If it were you, would you choose death or severing your tail to survive?"

It can't be!

Are you really about to die?

Gui quickly sensed his avatar. At this moment, he vaguely felt a tremendous force shaking the heavens in the Myriad Realms. Gui was a bit anxious. Is there a massive battle breaking out somewhere?

A massive battle is breaking out, and Su Yu still has the mind to ask me these questions?

You're really... seeking death!

"Nonsense, of course, survival first!"

Gui urgently said, "You're not really about to die, are you? Don't, Su Yu, living is hope... First, accept my friend's power. Their power is enough to make you stronger... At a critical moment... at worst, we'll descend with avatars to help you! Living is better than dying. If you die, you have nothing. Living, you can have everything!"

"Hahaha!"

Su Yu laughed, laughing heartily. At this moment, his laughter echoed inside and outside the gate, and the Myriad Races heard it, each with a solemn expression.

What's this guy laughing about again?

Is he coming again?

Of course, Su Yu had to laugh. Gui was interesting. Fear of death... truly is an instinct!

"Gui, if you were about to die, would you choose the same?"

Gui was even more speechless, "If I really had to choose between death and losing power, of course, I'd choose to lose power. Su Yu, isn't this what any normal being would do?"

This question is too boring!

Su Yu was relieved, reassured. That's good. I was afraid you were an old stubborn who wasn't afraid of death and wouldn't give up the Great Dao even if you died, which would be troublesome.

Since you're afraid of death... then I'm reassured!

The success rate of the plan suddenly increased.

Su Yu smiled and quickly said, "Gui... if I'm really facing a life-and-death crisis... you descend with your avatar to help me... but you might not be able to help me... My opponent might be about to break through to the first tier!"

Gui's heart moved. About to break through?

No wonder Su Yu seemed a bit off!

So, you're really struggling here?

"First tier? Are you sure? Can the Myriad Realms still give birth to a first-tier existence now?"

"Almost... The opponent hasn't reached it yet, but I feel a different kind of pressure than before. Gui, you say you're strong. Does your descending avatar have the power of the first tier? If not... maybe... I can't escape!"

Gui took a deep breath. Damn!

You're already facing a first-tier expert?

Then... then I must descend in person?

Headache!

He immediately said, "Let's not talk about this first. Accept my friend's power first. Maybe we can all think of a way. It's not so pessimistic. Su Yu, don't give up, don't despair!"

He had to comfort Su Yu. Don't be afraid. If you're really about to die... at worst, I'll help you once!

Su Yu laughed and transmitted, "Gui, if you can really help me... then at my most critical moment, I'll summon you. You strike with all your might upon descending, delivering a fatal blow to the opponent. How about it?"

A sneak attack?

Gui thought for a moment and then said, "But my avatar will only descend at the imprint location. Where is your battle area?"

"I'll lure the enemy to your imprint location. How about that?"

Gui quickly pondered. A sneak attack on a first-tier expert?

Has the opponent broken through?

Even if they have, it's just a fresh breakthrough. He had just broken through not long ago, but he was still more experienced than the opponent. If Su Yu found the right opportunity for him to sneak attack... maybe he could kill the opponent!

In that case, no one in the Myriad Realms could stop him!

For him, it was also a good thing.

After all, his hypothetical enemy was Su Yu's enemy, a second-tier peak existence, now even a first-tier, which was even more dangerous.

As he thought about it, Gui quickly said, "Su Yu, I'm quite powerful. If I were to descend with my full strength... I might possess the power of a second-tier peak. If I launch a surprise attack, there's a chance... provided you lure the opponent to the place of my imprint without getting killed!"

"I won't!" Su Yu confidently replied, "I've tangled with him for so long; I have that much capability. So, are you willing to help me this once? If you do, Gui, I'll find a way to let your true self descend. How about that?"

Gui secretly chuckled. Ha, as if I need your help? I can do it right now! If I descend, I can instantly kill Su Yu's opponent, then suppress and control Su Yu to make him work for me. Gui needed Su Yu's Heaven Gate to bring in more helpers for him! This way... it's a win-win!

At this moment, Gui was actually delighted. An opportunity! An opportunity to descend upon the Myriad Realms and seize control!

"Alright! Su Yu, find the opportunity... the moment I descend, I'll give the opponent a fatal blow with all my might!"

"Thank you!" Su Yu replied politely, his smile growing even brighter. Gui had taken the bait! This way, the situation was highly manageable. He turned to look behind him, waiting for the Human Emperor to sever the path, waiting for the opportunity to arise, waiting for the fish to bite. Whether he could instantly crush some people depended on this moment.

...

In the Myriad Realms.

The Human Emperor and his group had returned. The Human Emperor moved swiftly, and as he stepped into the Upper Realm, several powerful figures appeared. Lantian, Empyrean Cloud, Tea Plant, Marquis Huoyun, and even the Heaven Monitoring Marquis revealed themselves.

The Human Emperor was slightly taken aback. There were still five powerful figures! Su Yu, this guy, really had quite a few tricks up his sleeve. He had taken so many people away, yet there were still five strong ones left in the Myriad Realms.

At this moment, the Human Emperor had no time to look at the Myriad Realms, no time to reminisce about his homeland. As he and his group appeared, those around him were also somewhat surprised. Were these people also Su Yu's?

In the distance, Empyrean Cloud looked at the Human Emperor and said crisply, "Subordinate Empyrean Cloud greets the Human Emperor!"

As she spoke, she pointed to a small village in the distance. "Your Majesty, your world is right there! Before leaving, His Majesty instructed that upon your return, you should quickly integrate into the world. All preparations have been completed by His Majesty!"

With that, Lantian chuckled softly, "Junior Lantian greets Your Majesty! Before leaving, His Majesty instructed that if Your Majesty intends to sever the path... you must inform me in advance so I can relay it to His Majesty. Wait for His Majesty's instructions before severing the path. It must not be too early or too late, as it concerns His Majesty's life and death!"

The Human Emperor's eyes flickered. "Understood!" he said, looking at Lantian with a slight frown, then quickly sighed, "I apologize!"

Lantian laughed, "Your Majesty... are you speaking to me?"

Those around the Human Emperor were equally surprised. Why did His Majesty apologize?

The Human Emperor said nothing, just remained silent. Had everyone in this era gone mad? This Lantian was severely schizophrenic; he could see it at a glance. This was a madman, not much better than Su Yu.

The Human Emperor suddenly laughed at himself. Was my decision back then wrong? At this moment, he rarely doubted himself. The humans of the tenth tide seemed to have been driven mad. Whose fault was it? Mine? Perhaps... yes!

The apology was difficult to say, but he didn't know what else to say. He hadn't encountered many humans from this tide. He knew Su Yu was mad. Now, seeing Lantian, it was severe too. This method of splitting into countless avatars wasn't a normal method of splitting! This was a split in mental will. This person had long become a demon, not a demon lord, but truly demonized!

The Human Emperor closed his eyes, feeling that he had driven many geniuses mad. At this moment, he suddenly felt that his years of persistence were somewhat shaken. What exactly was my responsibility?

Moments later, the Human Emperor opened his eyes, with something more in them that no one could describe. He looked at Lantian again and smiled, "If you can convey this to Su Yu, tell him this era is not his alone! This heavy burden is not his alone! I... am the Human Emperor!"

He smiled, "Remember, even if he calls himself emperor, he is not the Human Emperor! The emperor of the human race... is only me. Even if Su Yu becomes the emperor of the myriad races, this human race is my responsibility, not his!"

I am the Human Emperor! And you are the human race! I am first your emperor, and even if you become the emperor of the myriad races, so what?

At this moment, the Human Emperor laughed, "Tell him I will soon sever the path. Wait for his message. If he needs it, he can do it anytime!"

"Doesn't the Human Emperor need to rest for a while?" Lantian laughed.

The Human Emperor also laughed, "Do you think I'm idle? Rest? Do I need it? Are you mocking me? I don't care about anything, just my dignity. If you mock me, have you considered the consequences?"

"..." Lantian was intimidated, coughing lightly, "No, Your Majesty, don't misunderstand, I wasn't mocking!"

A wise man knows when to retreat! The Human Emperor laughed.

Soon, a group of people appeared on Lantian's side. Marquis Dingjun looked awkward, laughing dryly, "Greetings, Your Majesty, greetings, Lord Ping Wang..."

In the crowd, Ping Wang looked at Dingjun with surprise. My goodness! You're really alive! Marquis Dingjun was even more embarrassed, "Um... um, my lords, I'm Dingjun!"

Ping Wang said in surprise, "Nonsense, I'd recognize you even if you turned to ash. You... aren't dead?"

"..." Marquis Dingjun instantly deflated, his face drooping, "My king, I'm still your retainer... don't say that about me, alright?"

Ping Wang also coughed dryly, "I didn't mean it that way... but... but you know, back then, I was under the Martial King. I was lucky to merge with the physical path and become a king. I didn't have many people under me, and you... cough, cough, you know, I didn't even have a few Daofuse under me... I almost arranged for an Eternal to be a marquis! You... you weren't even top-tier under me... and yet, you're still alive. I'm... I'm surprised!"

Ping Wang was extremely embarrassed. As a king, he was really lucky. He was a strong physical path cultivator, originally a war general under the Martial King. Later, he became independent and was crowned king, but he had no one under him! Most of the people he led stayed in the Martial King's mansion!

As for Dingjun, even under him, he wasn't top-tier. Back then, many third-tier Daofuse didn't become marquises. According to the strength of that time, in Su Yu's classification, Dingjun was at most a fourth-tier Daofuse, probably not even that. Barely stronger than a Daofuse using the Three Body Method.

Such a person wouldn't even touch the edge of being a marquis under the Martial King! Yet, Dingjun survived all these years and now had the power of a Heavenly King. It was unbelievable!

Marquis Dingjun was also speechless, as were the other injured kings. They wanted to laugh but couldn't. They had left many subordinates behind, almost all of whom died. There weren't many ancient marquises left on Su Yu's side. Yet, Marquis Dingjun was alive, and Ping Wang was surprised.

Ping Wang coughed dryly, "Cough, cough, it's nothing, it's nothing. It's good that you're alive. After all, you're one of us..."

Dingjun was even more embarrassed, "Um... my king, I've joined the Luminous Domain Mansion! But... but I'm... I'm about to join the Human Emperor's mansion too... cough, cough, um, I'm not a spy. I... His Majesty said before leaving that he would inform the Human Emperor, allowing us... to join the Human Emperor's world."

As he spoke, Marquis Dingjun grinned, "My king, if I become a ruler of laws... our strength... cough, cough, my king, have you made any progress over the years? You're not still a fifth-tier ruler of laws, are you? His Majesty said that a fifth-tier is only considered a strong Heavenly Venerable, not even a ruler of laws..."

Ping Wang's face turned green. Who are you mocking? He glared at Dingjun, annoyed, "I've long since broken through!"

"That's good, that's good!" Marquis Dingjun sighed in relief, "Otherwise, I'd really worry that you're still fifth-tier. If I became fourth-tier first, it would be too awkward when we meet in the future!"

"..." Ping Wang was utterly exhausted.

The Human Emperor laughed! He looked at these people and chuckled, "Su Yu, this guy, really dares to ask! A full 30 people, is he planning to occupy 30 paths of power in my world?"

Indeed, Su Yu arranged for a full 30 strong individuals to join the Human Emperor's world. Most were guards, along with some human experts. Including the Iron Devourer Race, which was a large family.

The Human Emperor was helpless. You really dare to ask. You want 30 at once! In the crowd, April said naively, "His Majesty said that our joining is to strengthen the Human Emperor's world, to contribute to the Human Emperor's strength!"

The Human Emperor was speechless. How could you say such shameless words? Of course, it seemed to be true for now. When did the Iron Devourer Race learn to be so shameless?

"You're April, right?" The Human Emperor smiled, "You want to merge with the Body Forging Path in my world? I was going to leave it for January..."

April grinned, "My great-grandfather won't mind. If the great-grandfather is strong, the descendants are strong. The great-grandfather will be happy. Your Majesty doesn't need to consider my great-grandfather!"

The Human Emperor laughed, "You all!" You're even willing to snatch your great-grandfather's path! He didn't say much, just nodded, "Then prepare yourselves. Bring the power of the great paths from Su Yu's world to me..."

He was about to say, bring some to me, not too much. The next moment, a group of people severed their paths in Su Yu's world, leaving no power behind, and headed towards the Human Emperor's village world with empty hands and bodies.

The Human Emperor was stunned! So straightforward? So clean? You guys, you said you were strengthening my world, but you didn't even bring a single hair of Su Yu's great path power. Is this strengthening my world? Come on!

The Human Emperor was almost amused!

These bastards, have you forgotten that once you merge with my world, I will soon control you all! Have you been brainwashed by Su Yu?

The Human Emperor felt helpless, a mix of amusement and exasperation. The earlier foul mood vanished, replaced by a reluctant smile brought on by these antics.

At this moment, Empyrean Cloud wore a serious expression and whispered, "Your Majesty, the Human Emperor... your world is only so vast. After merging, please try to compress it and avoid expanding..."

The Human Emperor was taken aback. What did that mean?

Empyrean Cloud, feeling a bit intimidated by his gaze, nonetheless mustered the courage to continue, "Well... His Majesty said, Human Emperor, please do not encroach upon his domain, otherwise... it wouldn't be appropriate!"

The Human Emperor's mouth fell open. Don't joke around; wasn't it me who opened up the Upper Realm? Who's encroaching on whom?

Just as he was about to speak, Empyrean Cloud suddenly looked sorrowful and said, "Please don't make things difficult for me, Human Emperor. I'm just following orders. If you insist on making things hard for me... I can only... only hang myself in your world!"

With that, he hung a rope outside the Human Emperor's domain, lamenting, "This is the boundary. If your world expands over here... I'll have no choice but to hang myself here!"

"......"

Everyone was speechless!

Among the crowd, King Gong's mouth twitched. "Well... Empyrean Cloud, you really are... really are..."

He had nothing more to say!

The Spirit Suppression Generals, who were once under his command, had now become rulers of laws and were even playing tricks with the Human Emperor!

He was at a loss for words!

The Human Emperor was also amused and exasperated. Su Yu, you're going too far!

Forget it, it's not worth arguing over.

Su Yu probably said it as a joke, but Empyrean Cloud took it seriously.

The Human Emperor decided to remain silent and wait patiently.

Waiting for news from Su Yu's side!

...

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly stood up.

Everyone around him was startled. Was it happening again?

However, Su Yu did not rush. He produced a blade, took a deep breath, and looked at everyone, baring his teeth as he transmitted his voice, "Prepare yourselves, fight to the death, the Human Emperor will sever the path, fight to the death!"

Everyone's hearts tightened!

Fight to the death!

Just as the Radiant King and others were about to approach, Su Yu waved them off, "Go, spread out! Radiant King, Consort of the Radiant King, Suppressing Martial King, you three, disperse to other areas. Remember, kill the enemy, kill the enemy, kill the enemy! Without my command, do not lose your composure, even if I am killed... if I don't give the order, do not come to aid!"

The group was once again shaken!

The Radiant King quickly said, "Your Majesty, your safety is still the priority..."

Su Yu's eyes were cold and stern, "Execute the military order!"

The Radiant King was somewhat intimidated by his gaze and, after a moment, replied in a low voice, "Understood!"

What was Su Yu planning?

On the opposite side, the myriad races were also helpless. Was it starting again?

Everyone was feeling a bit lazy and slack. Here it came again. How long did he plan to fight today before stopping?

Su Yu stood in place, waiting for a moment.

Moments later, a fierce shout erupted, "Kill!"

Boom!

The power of the world surged forth, instantly charging towards the myriad races!

Success or failure hinged on this moment!

Whether the Human Emperor came to aid or not was irrelevant.

If all went well, I would slay a few first-class experts and crush the myriad races' formation!

"Return, prepare, when I say strike, descend immediately!"

"Martial Emperor, when I tell you to devour the path, devour the Great Dao immediately, and fuse instantly!"

"Great Zhou King, hold off the opponent for me!"

"......"

Su Yu issued command after command, a bloody battle!

...

On the other side, the Immortal Emperor and others were slightly stunned by the strange formation.

Su Yu... wasn't with the other first-class experts, only a few second-class ones by his side. Wasn't he afraid of being surrounded and killed?

Did he think we hadn't noticed he was controlling over thirty rulers of laws?

The Demon Emperor licked his lips and murmured, "It seems... there's a bit of an opportunity!"

Previously, several first-class experts were together!

But now, they were scattered. Was this... heaven's assistance?

The Immortal Emperor and Divine Emperor exchanged glances, feeling tempted, but still lacking a catalyst, a reason for the myriad races to fight to the death and delay. Our efforts alone weren't enough; others needed to contribute as well!

Could there be such a catalyst?
