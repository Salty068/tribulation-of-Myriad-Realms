Chapter 786: Su Yu's Grand Plan

A surge of physical power erupted.

The various powerful figures were either recovering or strengthening themselves, creating a harmonious atmosphere. Of course, not everyone was pleased.

When Marquis Dingjun rushed back, he was panting heavily, realizing that things had already begun. "It's too fast," he thought, feeling his age catching up with him. "When did everything start moving at such a pace?"

He was anxious, trying to snatch some of the physical power, but he couldn't compete with the stronger ones. Frustrated, he ended up trying to take some from Heavendoom, who was hoarding a large amount of physical power. "Why does a big monkey like you need so much physical power?" he grumbled.

...

Despite the commotion, the strength of everyone was indeed increasing.

Some, however, did not experience any improvement. Nearby, a figure appeared silently. Marquis Tongtian, who had been unusually quiet, couldn't hold back any longer and whispered, "Your Majesty, when are we going to kill Yue Hao?"

"I want to become a Heavenly King too!"

Currently, he was still at the second tier, which was impressive, but with so many Heavenly Kings around, he felt undervalued. He believed that if he could kill Yue Hao, he would definitely become a Heavenly King!

"Or we could kill the Martial Emperor!" he suggested again.

Su Yu chuckled at his boldness. "Stop talking nonsense!"

Ignoring him, Su Yu turned his attention to those who were improving, and then to March and Giant Axe, who had absorbed a significant amount of life force and returned. He asked, "Senior March, has there been any recent battles in the Upper Realm?"

"There was a brief battle before, but it ended quickly. The arrival of the Tailless Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger made the Myriad Races wary, so they didn't dare to continue fighting."

"Useless!" Su Yu shook his head. "The Myriad Races are so indecisive, dragging things out! I'm actually more puzzled by why the Chaos Race is also dragging their feet. Honestly, if I were them, I would have already swept through the Myriad Races with overwhelming force!"

The Chaos Race shouldn't be too weak. The strength they've revealed might not be their full power.

March explained, "The Gate of Hell might be about to open. The Chaos Race could be waiting for it to open."

Is that so?

Su Yu fell into deep thought. The Gate of Hell was said to seal the Chaos Era. Would a large number of Chaos Ancient Beasts appear then? Would the rulers of laws emerge? Could there be peerless experts?

If so, it would be troublesome!

Su Yu pondered, "The Myriad Races and the Chaos Race must engage in battle. Both sides need to deplete each other's strength! Otherwise, both sides will be difficult to deal with. The Myriad Races have probably over ten Heavenly Sovereigns, and quite a few Heavenly Kings!"

Narrowing his eyes, Su Yu continued, "I can't delay any longer! Upstream, the Human Emperor and the others might be returning soon. Their return isn't good news; they're likely at a disadvantage, possibly even suffering losses!"

"I'm also worried about one thing—the Control King... behind the Gate of Hell!"

At this, both March and Giant Axe's expressions changed slightly.

Su Yu said solemnly, "The probability of the Control King being with the Human Emperor is low, and it's also unlikely he's with the Culture King. The most likely scenario is that the Control King entered the Gate of Hell, avoiding the upheaval when the Human Emperor took all the strong ones away!"

"I'm also curious, is it impossible to come out of the Gate of Hell? From what I know, it seems some from the Chaos Race entered the Gate of Hell. Can they enter but not exit?"

As these thoughts emerged, Su Yu asked, "Seniors, who do you think I should attack first if I were to make a move now?"

Giant Axe thought for a moment and said, "Why not join forces with the Myriad Races and attack the traitors first? We don't know when the Gate of Hell will open. If strong ones emerge from it, it will be even harder to fight. It's better to eliminate the ones outside first, then deal with those inside!"

"When those inside come out, the Myriad Races will have to fight them too!"

Giant Axe quickly added, "I think the Myriad Races are actually afraid right now, afraid of the Gate of Hell opening!"

That's true!

Su Yu, Hundred Battle, and others have their bases here. They're not afraid of the Human Emperor and others returning. But the unknown number of strong ones behind the Gate of Hell is what truly terrifies people.

Su Yu fell into contemplation. Should he attack the Chaos Race first?

He stroked his chin, pondering, "Maybe... we can discuss an alliance! The Myriad Races are probably most eager to become rulers of laws. Once the seal is broken, they could instantly become stronger, with over ten Heavenly Sovereigns!"

"But if the seal isn't broken, the Myriad Races aren't that much of a threat. Their strength is just that."

At this moment, Su Yu was somewhat conflicted.

If the two sides above don't fight... well, they will eventually, but how long will that take?

Three months?

Five months?

For the Myriad Races and the Chaos Race, that's not too long. The key is, damn it, I'm impatient!

I have too many things to do!

I still need to find a way upstream!

Is it my style to passively take hits?

Is waiting for the Human Emperor and others to return my plan?

Damn it, I need to go up there!

Finish things over there, bring the strong ones, then break into the Heaven Gate, kill all the enemies the Culture King and others face, and it's done!

Why make it so complicated?

Wait for what?

In three months, five months, I could become a ruler of laws!

Su Yu fell into deep thought, then quickly said, "I need to explore first, move my world from the chaos to Chaos Mountain! Once my world reaches Chaos Mountain, if we encounter a crisis, everyone retreats into Chaos Mountain, and that's our chance!"

As he spoke, Su Yu's eyes sparkled. "I have another idea!"

March and Giant Axe looked curious.

What idea?

Su Yu ignored them, waiting for Wan Tiansheng and others to arrive before quickly saying, "I want to transform my world into a treasure land! A treasure land appearing deep in the chaos, attracting strong ones from all sides. What do you think?"

Silence fell over the group.

Heavendoom, who had just returned, couldn't help but say, "Your Majesty is planning to return to your old ways and continue scamming?"

"Shut up!"

Su Yu scolded, "You're the one scamming, not me! I never deceive people!"

He stroked his chin, ignoring Heavendoom, and soon smiled, "Is there anyone here with experience? In the chaos, do any benefits float out?"

If there's a precedent, it would be easier!

If not, it would be difficult, and people might be suspicious.

At this, everyone thought for a moment. Suddenly, Hongmeng spoke up, "Yes! Your Majesty remembers my Great Dao, right? A divine mountain! It floated out from the chaos!"

Su Yu's eyes lit up.

Hongmeng continued, "There are benefits in the chaos. Otherwise, how do the Chaos Ancient Beasts cultivate? Chaos Mountain is also part of the chaos. Chaos isn't just a void; there are some lands, but only those ancient beasts have a chance to encounter them!"

Su Yu's eyes sparkled. "So, if I disguise my world as a chaotic ancient land, will strong ones from both sides come?"

Everyone exchanged glances. Hongmeng said solemnly, "What will Your Majesty use to attract everyone? Without significant benefits, neither side will gather recklessly, especially not the Heavenly Sovereigns!"

Benefits?

Indeed, they wouldn't rush over just for an empty land.

"What's attractive to the Heavenly Sovereigns is still the matter of breaking through to become rulers of laws. Other treasures might not interest them anymore."

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "But breaking through to become rulers of laws, unless through the Chaos Dao, has little to do with chaos!"

He squinted and said, "Honestly, the chaotic land isn't that tempting to the Myriad Races, but it is to the Control King's lineage. If handled properly, the Control King's lineage, with many cultivating the Chaos Dao, might be tempted!"

"Moreover, the Control King's lineage has delved into chaos, even killing ancient beasts!"

As ideas emerged, Su Yu quickly dismissed them.

After a moment, he suddenly looked at an inconspicuous figure. Following his gaze, everyone turned to a little girl in the distance.

The Tea Plant was chatting with the Book Spirit, not involving herself in such brainy matters.

Sensing everyone's gaze, the Tea Plant looked up in confusion. "What's going on?"

Everyone turned to Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled, "The Tea Plant is actually a member of the Chaos Ancient Race! Do you think if a Chaos Beast were about to advance to the level of a ruler of laws, it would attract the Control King's lineage?"

What does that mean?

Wan Tiansheng and others seemed to understand. The Great Zhou King frowned slightly, "But the Tea Plant is only at the third-tier Daofuse Realm. Its advancement is slow, and it hasn't integrated into Your Majesty's world. It's still far from becoming a ruler of laws. If it's not a ruler of laws, it's meaningless!"

The Control King's lineage has a keen eye. Observing a breakthrough to a ruler of laws is possible, but a third-tier Daofuse breaking to the second-tier? They probably wouldn't bother watching!

Su Yu licked his lips and smiled, "Not just advancing to a ruler of laws, but this ruler of laws is an extremely rare Enlightenment Tea Plant! No one knows the Tea Plant is an Enlightenment Tea Plant, right? They don't know it counts as a Chaos Ancient Race, do they?"

"Even if they know of the Tea Plant's existence, they wouldn't think it's close to becoming a ruler of laws..."

"Moreover, the Tea Plant's leaves would emit various powers of the Great Dao, giving people the impression that drinking its tea could make them rulers of laws!"

...

Everyone looked at Su Yu again. Was he planning to target the Chaos Race, and possibly use this world, including the Tea Plant, to lure them?

Su Yu smiled, "Everyone, any suggestions?"

Wan Tiansheng immediately asked, "Your Majesty, are you sure we should attack the Control King's lineage first?"

In a deep voice, he said, "If that's the case, our previous defeat was meaningless. Our goal was to remain hidden, not to act now. We might be able to contend with one faction, but we can't contend with all of them! Your Majesty, even Hundred Battle isn't on the same page as us. If we suffer heavy losses, others will benefit!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "No problem! Everyone has their own agenda!"

Su Yu quickly continued, "Let's put it this way. It's not just three forces at play now, but multiple forces! There's us, Hundred Battle, the myriad races, the Control King, and the Chaos Ancient Beasts, making it five forces! Additionally, there are the scattered experts like the Martial Emperor and the Nether Emperor. Although they're sealed now, they will eventually be unsealed!"

"Right now, whoever makes the first move and suffers heavy losses will be taken advantage of by others!"

Su Yu chuckled, "So the best strategy is for everyone to wait for others to make the first move. We think this way, Hundred Battle thinks this way, and even the myriad races and the Control King think this way. They all hope the myriad races will attack the lower realm first..."

"But someone still has to make the first move!"

Su Yu laughed, "They're not in a hurry, but we are! Since that's the case, we'll stir things up first and force everyone to act!"

The crowd raised their eyebrows slightly, wondering how he planned to force them.

Su Yu said mysteriously, "Who said the Tea Plant was meant to trap the Control King's lineage? It's not a trap; it's a help!"

Everyone looked at Su Yu again. Wan Tiansheng and the others frowned, remaining silent for a while.

Su Yu smiled, "Here's what I think. The Tea Plant is like an innocent child..."

Everyone turned to look at the Tea Plant, who seemed bewildered. Am I really that naive?

"She doesn't know how precious her tea leaves are. She's very powerful, yet very friendly! When a weakling from the Chaos lineage enters my world and sees the Tea Plant, she warmly offers her tea leaves to entertain him, and his strength improves!"

The crowd listened as if hearing a story!

Su Yu squinted, "If the Chaos clan member is ruthless, he should kill the Tea Plant right then and there, seizing all her tea leaves and even the Tea Plant herself! If he's wary of her strength, he'll try to curry favor to get more tea leaves!"

"And at this moment, if the news that the Tea Plant can help them advance to the level of a ruler of laws reaches the myriad races... what will they do?"

Upon hearing this, the Great Zhou King chuckled, "The myriad races certainly won't allow them to continue advancing! What if several rulers of laws emerge? The myriad races might preemptively deal with the Chaos clan or the Tea Plant... depending on their assessment!"

Lantian also laughed, "If they deal with the Chaos clan, it aligns with our intentions. If they target the Tea Plant, the Chaos clan will surely come to her aid. Both sides will come to this world, and we won't need to reveal ourselves; they'll come to us!"

The highest level of deception is not delivering the trap but having others come to you willingly to be deceived!

Wan Tiansheng chimed in, "The current challenges are several. First, the Tea Plant's strength is insufficient. Her tea leaves are potent, but not very effective on those above the second-tier Daofuse Realm! Second, how do we 'accidentally' encounter a strong member of the Control King's lineage? Third, how can the myriad races quickly learn of this without any suspicion? Fourth, the Eight-Winged Tiger and Tailless Dragon know that Your Majesty has opened a world; will they suspect anything? They have seen the Tea Plant! Fifth..."

He listed several challenges.

The core of this plan lies with the Tea Plant.

The Tea Plant is part of the Chaos Ancient Race, a fact known to few. Generally, the Chaos Ancient Race doesn't visit the Myriad Realms due to suppression, but the Tea Plant is an exception, possibly related to the Culture King or the Time Sage.

Thus, it's rare to see the Chaos Ancient Race mingling with other races.

And on Su Yu's side, it's impossible to have a Tea Plant close to the level of a ruler of laws.

As for the previous Tea Plant, she was only at the fourth-tier Daofuse Realm, now at the third-tier, which isn't a significant improvement.

The Chaos clan is known for their slow advancement!

Su Yu nodded, "The Tea Plant's strength is indeed a bit lacking!"

The girl transformed from the Tea Plant looked a bit aggrieved. Am I really that weak?

Not too bad!

Su Yu laughed, "However, it's not impossible to quickly enhance her strength! The Tea Plant follows the Chaos Dao, which is more about combat and devouring, including devouring treasures and ancient beasts. Last time, we killed many ancient beasts. If the Tea Plant devours more, and I extract some pure chaotic power, she might not reach the Heavenly King level, but the second-tier Daofuse Realm is achievable!"

"As for the aura, it's simple. The Tea Plant is above, and the South King is buried below!"

The South King looked at Su Yu. What kind of talk is this?

Su Yu chuckled, "It's my world. Isn't it easy to hide someone? The South King will be buried at the Tea Plant's roots, and the South King's aura will naturally blend. Of course, the Tea Plant is from the Chaos Ancient Race, so only the aura is needed, while the chaotic aura will be provided by the Tea Plant herself!"

In this way, a Chaos expert close to the level of a ruler of laws would appear!

"The Tea Plant's leaves aren't very helpful for top-tier Daofuse experts, so we'll need to fake it!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Tea Plant can use her leaves as initial trash to give away. If the trash is so powerful, what about the better ones? We'll hang a few hundred golden fake leaves on the Tea Plant and claim they're original leaves not for gifting... When people see this, they'll naturally know it's a treasure. Below, at the very bottom, we'll hang some of the Tea Plant's own leaves as trash, to be used and consumed freely. If they help even second-tier Daofuse experts, do you think people will be curious about the leaves above?"

Everyone nodded, certainly!

Even the trash can make people covetous, let alone the best ones.

Su Yu continued, "Moreover, we can let everyone engrave their best chaotic insights into the Tea Plant's leaves. This way, the effect will be even better. In my world, I can assist others in comprehending the Dao, making them feel that the Tea Plant's leaves are extraordinarily beneficial!"

Everyone inhaled sharply. This guy, Su Yu, is truly a master of deception!

"As for the 'accidental' encounter with the Control King's people..."

Su Yu fell into thought, "I'm considering whether to collaborate with Hundred Battle. He has a special relationship with Moon Luo and might have planted a spy in the Control King's lineage!"

Wan Tiansheng hesitated for a moment before speaking, "It's best not to. If we collaborate, Hundred Battle will see through our plans!"

He quickly added, "Your Majesty... I actually think... we can collaborate with the Eight-Winged Tiger!"

"Hmm?"

Su Yu looked at him, and Wan Tiansheng quickly explained, "The Eight-Winged Tiger, as Your Majesty saw last time, is a clever creature! I think we can use him as the intermediary. For instance, he could chase a member of the Chaos clan into our territory, or he could arrange for a Chaos Ancient Race member to advance in our territory, and the news leaks out... It can't come from us, but if it comes from the ancient beasts, there won't be a problem!"

People might suspect Su Yu, but they would never suspect the ancient beasts.

Because in everyone's eyes, ancient beasts are synonymous with stupidity!

No matter how strong, their brains are still the same!

If the ancient beasts say it's good, the Control King's lineage will naturally believe it!

Su Yu hesitated, "I'm worried that the Eight-Winged Tiger might be colluding with the Control King's lineage."

Wan Tiansheng shook his head, "I don't think so. Is the Control King's lineage truly allied with the Chaos Ancient Beasts? Not necessarily. If they were, they would have united with those ancient beasts long ago! The exact relationship between the Control King's lineage and the Chaos Ancient Race might only be known to the Control King! Moreover, the ancient beasts behind the Gate of Hell might not represent those outside! If we can reach an agreement, it will also prevent information from leaking!"

In this way, many things would fall into place.

Wan Tiansheng added, "If we can truly lure both sides into our world, our combat power will soar. Your Majesty can suppress them with the world, and the South King might even match a ruler of laws. By then, our Heavenly Sovereigns and Heavenly Kings will increase!"

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "Your Majesty's mind is truly agile. This is just like when we lured people into the Nanyuan relics in the Great Xia Prefecture! Everyone had to fight for the relics and gather together!"

"In Nanyuan, there were drawbacks, as we couldn't suppress the enemy. Here, in Your Majesty's world, you can suppress them!"

This strategy should be familiar to everyone.

Of course, no one would think that Su Yu, who created the Nanyuan relics back then, is now creating the Tea Plant Sanctuary in the chaos!

Wan Tiansheng continued, "If the Tea Plant's leaves can help Chaos Dao experts advance to the level of a ruler of laws, then even the Heavenly Sovereigns like Moon Hao will be tempted, including the so-called ancestors!"

"Their first thought will be to attack!"

Wan Tiansheng quickly added, "But we can make them wary... For instance, the Tea Plant Sanctuary is actually the territory of the Eight-Winged Tiger!"

He looked at Su Yu, "Your Majesty, do you think the Control King's lineage has any arrangements among the ancient beasts?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "Perhaps!"

"Yes, if the Eight-Winged Tiger has their ancient beasts under him, it will be even better. If the Eight-Winged Tiger is willing to cooperate, let him sneak to the Tea Plant, get discovered, get followed, and sell the information to the Control King's lineage... This way, by passing through several hands, it increases the difficulty for the Control King's lineage to obtain the information, making them believe it's genuine!"

Increasing the difficulty for the other side to obtain intelligence will make the Control King's lineage think, "We paid a high price for this intelligence, so it must be true."

"In this way, the Control King's lineage won't dare to recklessly attack the Tea Plant Sanctuary, buying us time. This time difference is the time for the myriad races to receive the information!"

"As for where the myriad races get their intelligence from... that's something to consider!"

At this moment, March couldn't help but interject, "I can just tell the myriad races!"

"......"

Everyone rolled their eyes!

Shut up!

It would be better if you didn't say anything. If you do, the myriad races will definitely suspect something!

The Iron Devourer Race's suggestions are utterly useless!

March felt exhausted. What else could be done? The myriad races wouldn't recklessly venture into the Land of Chaos. If they couldn't go deep, what could be done?

Su Yu stroked his chin and asked, "Does the myriad races have any spies within the Control King's lineage?"

"I'm afraid not. The Control King's lineage was exposed too recently," the Great Zhou King shook his head. "In such a short time, it's impossible to contact their weaker members."

This made intelligence gathering for the myriad races rather troublesome.

At this moment, March looked at Giant Axe, and Giant Axe looked at March. Soon, everyone turned to the warriors. Did you hear that?

Now, Su Yu and his group were worried that the myriad races wouldn't be able to obtain intelligence!

What a mess!

Su Yu fell into deep thought. "Indeed, we need to provide the myriad races with a reliable source of information..."

March couldn't help but speak up, "I might have a solution!"

"Please, March Senior, go ahead!"

"The myriad races are currently trying to win over the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Tailless Dragon..."

As soon as he said this, Su Yu's eyes lit up. "The Tea Plant belongs to the Eight-Winged Tiger, but it was discovered by the Control King's lineage. They want to forcibly seize it, and the Eight-Winged Tiger can't resist. Feeling indignant, it turns to the myriad races, telling them that if they don't help reclaim the Tea Plant, they're doomed. They claim it will ascend to become a master of laws... Whether the myriad races want to seize the Tea Plant or stop the Control King's lineage, they must act! This way, obtaining intelligence becomes much simpler!"

"......"

Goodness!

March grumbled under his breath. Damn it, I hadn't even finished speaking, and you've already come up with a plan!

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "Even if the myriad races don't come, if the Control King's lineage is drawn in, honestly, killing a few Heavenly Sovereigns would still be profitable, right?"

Off to the side, the Tea Plant complained, "How did I become the Eight-Winged Tiger's?"

What are you all talking about?

I only know that I've become the Eight-Winged Tiger's!

I'm not!

I'm the young master's!

Su Yu coughed lightly. "You're not really the Eight-Winged Tiger's, just pretending!"

What is this Tea Plant thinking!

Ignoring the Tea Plant, Su Yu quickly smiled and said, "This way, we have the advantage of timing, location, and people. If the myriad races and the Control King's lineage fight, that's ideal. If not, we'll target the Control King's lineage! Kill them! If we manage to kill a few Heavenly Sovereigns and the myriad races still don't take advantage, then they're not worth worrying about. These guys are too scattered and too slow!"

Lantian laughed, "What about Hundred Battle? I'm not targeting him, but he has plans within the Control King's lineage. Our plan might disrupt his plans or even kill his people. If that happens, what do we do?"

This possibility exists!

Moreover, what if Moon Luo comes?

He laughed, "If Moon Luo comes, do we kill her? Moon Luo is strong! But she might be Hundred Battle's person. If we don't kill her, our plan fails. If we do, we become enemies with Hundred Battle!"

Su Yu was silent for a moment, his eyes narrowing. "Kill!"

Everyone's hearts tightened!

Su Yu coldly said, "Why not kill? Anyone from the Control King's lineage can be killed! Especially core members! As for her being Hundred Battle's person... what does that have to do with me? She's not my person. I just don't want to fall out with Hundred Battle now, causing internal strife and significant losses! But if his people are hiding in the dark, do I have to accommodate them?"

As for Hundred Battle turning hostile after the kill... let him. If a spy of his gets killed, that's his problem!

Su Yu had no interest in protecting his spies!

After speaking, Su Yu quickly added, "Don't worry about these things. If necessary, I'll inform Hundred Battle. Of course, whether he listens is his business!"

He said no more on the matter. At worst, he could destroy their physical bodies and suppress their sea of will. If Hundred Battle wanted them back, he could hand them over for a price.

As for other concerns, Su Yu didn't want to think about them.

If worrying about others led to the death of his own people, that would be the real problem!

The Great Zhou King spoke, "So, Your Majesty plans to emerge soon?"

We've been lying low, but it's been like playing hide and seek!

Truly speechless!

The Great Zhou King calculated. It's only been a little over a month.

Of course, everything has changed.

The strength has transformed dramatically!

Moreover, this time, Su Yu's plan has a high chance of success!

Su Yu nodded, "I plan to emerge. Of course, you all don't need to for now. Continue lying low!"

Su Yu's eyes narrowed, "Fat Ball, Tongtian, are known strong individuals! You'll come with me! I plan to ascend to the Upper Realm with March!"

Everyone was shocked, and Su Yu smiled, "Yes, I want to place myself in the open! Right under the myriad races' noses, that's the best choice! I'm right here, so you don't need to worry about me. My current goal is singular: revenge!"

"Giant Axe, March, along with Fat Ball, Tongtian, and me, that's our strength. Not weak! But to say very strong... it's decent!"

Su Yu laughed, "I want to establish a sect in the Upper Realm, truly occupying a part of it! This way, I have both overt and covert lines! I even want to bring the Iron Devourer Race over, openly negotiating with the myriad races. I want to cooperate to kill the other side. I have Heavenly Sovereigns, Fat Ball, March, Giant Axe, three Heavenly Sovereign-level powerhouses. If you don't agree, don't blame me for being rude!"

"This way, I'm in the open, and everyone can see!"

Su Yu finished, then added, "Besides these few, the strong individuals known to Tiangu and others are only one, Senior Hongmeng! But Senior Hongmeng is a guardian and can't leave for the Upper Realm recklessly, so my strength is almost fully exposed. Even if a few Daofuse remain, they're insignificant!"

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "The greatest concealment is in the city! We're right under the noses of the myriad races and the Control King's lineage, so what do they have to worry about? The only concern is Hundred Battle, which has nothing to do with us! If they want to fight, let them fight Hundred Battle. It's none of my business!"

Everyone looked at each other, feeling slightly moved.

Two lines, overt and covert!

This... might be a good idea!

Constant hiding only breeds suspicion.

This way, with Su Yu taking several Heavenly Sovereigns to the Upper Realm, there's also safety. The myriad races wouldn't rashly start a war with Su Yu, letting the Control King's lineage take advantage!

The Great Zhou King nodded slightly, smiling, "Your Majesty's move is brilliant! By placing yourself under the myriad races' noses, they won't worry anymore. Moreover, the strength isn't weak, with multiple Heavenly Sovereigns. Your Majesty should be more high-profile! Even if my strength is damaged, I have many strong followers! The more high-profile, the more at ease the myriad races will be!"

Su Yu laughed, "Exactly! We're already so strong, so will they still wonder how many strong individuals we're hiding?"

Certainly not!

Hongmeng can't leave, and the others are dead. The South King and others are undead, so where would Su Yu hide his strength?

Everything is open and aboveboard.

Everyone knows Su Yu's foundation.

How many years has it been since he rose?

Even if he hid strong individuals, he couldn't hide them!

Su Yu quickly decided, "That's settled! I'll first find a way to move the world to the Upper Realm, then contact the Eight-Winged Tiger. The cooperation with the Eight-Winged Tiger becomes very important! As for the arrangements in the Tea Plant's sacred land, I'll have to trouble Director Wan and the others!"

Su Yu wasn't worried about their ability to fake it. Old Wan was quite skilled at faking!

"Once I've moved the world up, March, you can leave then! March, Giant Axe, you two seniors, head to the Realm of Living Beings first, with just one goal... to buy time! Once I've arranged everything, head to the Upper Realm, including Thunderstorm and the others!"

Su Yu smiled, "When I leave, I'll seal the passage!"

Everyone felt a bit strange, and Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Sixty council tokens might be hard to seal proactively... but most are in the Upper Realm. Once I'm up there, I'll directly tell the myriad races that I want to seal the passage, not to block them from descending, but to block Hundred Battle from ascending. Do you think the myriad races will agree?"

As soon as he said this, everyone felt even stranger. The Great Zhou King said quietly, "They will, provided Your Majesty agrees to return the tokens they lent after sealing it. This way, Your Majesty alone can't use the remaining council tokens to open the passage to the lower realm... In that case, the myriad races might laugh themselves silly!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Of course! By then, they'll have to thank me!"

Yes, they definitely would thank Su Yu.

Su Yu laughed, "This way, it becomes difficult for Hundred Battle to interfere with us! Besides, the passage at Soul Burying Mountain, to be honest, might already be exposed, so just seal it off!"

Everyone was impressed!

His Majesty still thought of everything. This way, Hundred Battle's interference would be eliminated.

They would ascend first, using the Fate Clan's path... which wasn't a simple task, extremely difficult!

How to ascend, that was the challenge.

Wan Tiansheng also laughed, "Hundred Battle wants to descend and lie low, only to find... he can't go back up. That's interesting!"

By then, Hundred Battle would be anxious.

How do I get up there?

What's the situation up there?

Hundred Battle must know about the Soul Burying Mountain passage, which is also his channel for intelligence. Sealing it, he can't access the ninth level of the Luminous Domain Mansion, and he might not dare to go to the Land of Chaos.

So, there's no way up!

Su Yu laughed, "Yes, and I need to have a word with the Martial Emperor, to prevent Hundred Battle from ascending to the ninth level and going from the Source of the Dao. This way, the lower realm effectively seals off Hundred Battle, unable to ascend or descend!"

Everyone looked at each other and chuckled.

This way, Hundred Battle's interference could be eliminated!

We can focus on playing in the Upper Realm!

Su Yu added, "Before that, there's one more thing to do: capture the Heavenly Overseer Marquis!"

Su Yu squinted, "The Heavenly Overseer Marquis can't die. If Hundred Battle gets anxious and can't ascend, and kills the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, what do I do? The myriad races gaining over a dozen masters of laws is unacceptable!"

"Duobao!"

Su Yu called out, and Duobao quickly responded, "Here!"

At this moment, Duobao was as obedient as could be.

Su Yu smiled, "Take me to find the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. I'm protecting him; he can't die."

"Your Majesty, I..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, "You better find it, stop with the nonsense! If you can't find it, should I just cut you down now? Can you find it then?"

"I can find it!" Duobao replied helplessly. He hadn't even said he couldn't find it, so why was Su Yu being so fierce? It was terrifying!

Only then did Su Yu smile, "The plan is tentatively set. If any changes occur, I'll adjust accordingly. Everyone should integrate into my world, focus on cultivation, and strive to become rulers of the laws within it!"

"Let's head out and find the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. I'm really worried someone might kill him!"

At this moment, Su Yu was in high spirits. The plan was roughly outlined, and now it was time to see how to implement it. If everything went smoothly, he would gradually resolve the troubles of the Myriad Realms.

First, deal with the Myriad Races and the Control King's lineage, then solve the Hundred Battle King's issues. After that, tackle the problems with the Undead Emperor and the Martial Emperor. Finally, see who among the Gate of Hell and the Human Emperor causes trouble first.

If the Gate of Hell doesn't break open soon, then he'll lead people upstream to assist the Human Emperor and his forces. The Human Emperor's side had been fighting for so many years without defeat, indicating that the gap, while present, wasn't insurmountable. If it were too large, they would have been wiped out long ago.

If he could bring ten rulers of the laws over, perhaps the situation could be reversed!

Xingyue had gone upstream. As a healer, once she joined forces with the Human Emperor, she would undoubtedly help them hold out even longer.

"Yes, after resolving the Myriad Realms' troubles, I aim to have ten rulers of the laws on my side!"

Su Yu stood up and shouted, "Let's go, head up first, and make sure to protect the Heavenly Overseer Marquis!"

"……"

Everyone watched him, full of vigor and confidence, feeling somewhat helpless. Who was it that wanted to beat up the Heavenly Overseer Marquis just the other day? It had scared the Marquis so much that he had to challenge Su Yu to a duel!

The South King quickly suggested, "In that case, let's explore the chaos first, advancing on two fronts to save time. I see that Your Majesty is eager to resolve things swiftly!"

Su Yu laughed, "Indeed! But the chaos is dangerous, so the South King must be careful. How about this... Fat Ball, Lanshan, Tianhuo, and Lantian will accompany you to explore the chaos first!"

With these five together, even if they encountered a ruler of the laws, they could put up a good fight. If the opponent was weaker, the five of them could take them down together!

"Giant Axe, March, Tongtian, Duobao, come with me to find the Heavenly Overseer Marquis!"

"Director Wan, oversee the Death Realm!"

"Everyone else, focus on your cultivation!"

Su Yu issued commands one by one, assigning everyone their tasks, ensuring all were well arranged.

...

Soon, Su Yu led his group out of the realm. On this day, in the Myriad Realms, Su Yu had returned!

He wasn't being overly cautious, not caring about anything, his aura spreading across the heavens and earth. Arrogant as ever, after lying low for over a month, he was back!

For now, he wouldn't bother with the Hundred Battle King! He had left the Human Realm, but that didn't mean he wouldn't come to the Myriad Realms. What was there to fear?

"Heavenly Overseer!"

Su Yu shouted with a hearty laugh, "I'm here to find you!"

Several auras spread across the heavens and earth!

...

At this moment, in the Immortal Realm.

Tiangu and the Symbol King exchanged glances, frowning. Damn it! This guy hadn't been gone for long! Didn't he say he was bidding farewell to the Myriad Realms? And now, after just a few days of peace, he was back?

Everyone was speechless!

...

At this moment, in the Human Realm.

The Hundred Battle King and his group also frowned. Su Yu... had returned! This... was too fast!

The Hundred Battle King frowned deeply, more concerned about what Su Yu wanted with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. Could it be... he intended to kill the Marquis? That would be reckless!

The Hundred Battle King frowned even more. Lately, it seemed like troubles were piling up. He had just been troubled by that woman, and now Su Yu was back! In his mind, Su Yu shouldn't have returned so soon.

...

At the same time.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis adjusted his robes, feeling a bit dejected after being troubled by that woman. Now that Su Yu was here, he thought, fine, let's have a life-and-death battle with Su Yu!

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis showed a calm demeanor. Who would win was still uncertain! Su Yu, here I come!
