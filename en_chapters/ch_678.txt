Chapter 678: Striking the Disobedient (Please Subscribe)

All 27 Guardians advanced to the ninth stage.

Before leaving, Su Yu had provoked the Martial Emperor, hoping to drive him mad. Once that guy regained his senses, he even learned how to annoy Su Yu in return.

Fight? Who's afraid of whom?

"Heh!"

As Su Yu emerged from the teleportation, he let out a cold laugh. The Martial Emperor was indeed powerful, but until he emerged, who was afraid of him?

The Guardians and Monarchs around him were puzzled. Su Yu seemed both pleased and displeased, a complex mix of emotions.

Hetu didn't concern himself with these matters and quickly said, "Your Majesty, now that Shan Qi and the others have advanced, should we engage the North King?"

Given the current situation, they could definitely defeat the North King. The only question was how much they would lose in the process.

Su Yu had waited for all the Guardians to advance, naturally aiming to annihilate the enemy without losses. However, battles are unpredictable.

Su Yu remained silent, glancing at the Celestial River of Death beside him. He sensed danger.

Not being foolish, Su Yu knew that some Necrolords had appeared internally, perhaps lying in wait. If they engaged the North King, these entities might seize the opportunity.

The exact number was unclear.

"Let's go!"

Without further words, Su Yu led the group across the Celestial River of Death. Powerful auras surged, and beneath the river, Necrolords were indeed monitoring them. Su Yu sensed this and sneered internally. Trying to take advantage of me? Dream on!

Among the group, Hetu received a message and quickly departed, heading towards Grand Dream City.

...

The North King grew increasingly uneasy!

Damn it, in such a short time, he felt like Su Yu had returned!

The North King quickly soared into the sky, looking towards the Celestial River of Death in the North King Domain. His expression changed as he muttered, "Guardians!"

He seemed to see those Guardians!

At this moment, other Necrolords also emerged, each looking in that direction. In the distance, a golden light flickered—it was Su Yu!

A group of Necrolords turned pale.

Su Yu had brought the Guardians?

The North King quickly reassured them, "Don't worry! The few Daofuse Guardians like Heavendoom haven't come, and Grandstar won't leave. Only some Eternal Guardians are here!"

Don't be afraid!

He comforted the Necrolords, assuring them there was nothing to worry about.

But internally, he was extremely anxious!

The Guardians seemed stronger than before. Although they couldn't match a Daofuse, a few together could resist one.

This was a big problem!

Was Su Yu crazy?

Taking away these Guardians, wasn't he afraid the outside world would notice?

Or... were those fools outside replaced by Su Yu without knowing?

That was the only explanation!

Otherwise, leaving so many Guardians at once was almost impossible.

"Perhaps it's time to flee!"

The North King knew this well, feeling helpless and regretful.

If it didn't work out, he would flee.

Once Su Yu arrived with his forces, escape would be difficult.

He wasn't the only one thinking this; the other Necrolords weren't foolish either.

At this moment, they all had similar thoughts.

In the distance, Su Yu's grand voice echoed through the heavens, "Will you still resist? Those who defy will be executed! As I said before, it still stands! North King, if you disperse your path now, there's still a chance. Once you act, you will surely die!"

His grand voice resounded throughout the North King Domain.

In the North King Domain, the intelligent Monarchs were extremely fearful.

On the other side, the South King's cold voice rang out, "North King, still not surrendering? Do you wish to be executed?"

At this moment, the North King felt cornered!

He glanced at the Necrolords beside him and the Monarchs below. He still had a chance.

Escape now!

The South King would struggle to catch him. He could flee to the Celestial River of Death or the Abyss. His strength wasn't weak, and even in the Abyss, he might be fine.

Su Yu didn't intend to fight him to the death, only to use overwhelming force to compel his surrender or to flatten the North King's Palace with minimal losses.

Should he flee?

Leaving the North King's Palace, which he had managed for years, to become a wandering, ignorant undead again?

In life, it was like this.

In death, must it be the same?

The North King looked towards the Celestial River of Death and suddenly laughed.

"Su Yu!"

The North King's laughter shook the heavens, "In the end, you're just a weakling! You can rely on the South King to suppress me, but you can't suppress this world! Sooner or later, this world will rebel! In the past, when the Human Emperor, Culture King, and Martial King were alive, who dared to defy them?"

"You... are still too weak. Be it the living or the dead, who would willingly submit to you?"

"The stronger your subordinates, the more interesting the backlash will be!"

"Even if you defeat me, you can't conquer this world!"

The North King laughed heartily. He sensed the violent turbulence in the Celestial River of Death. He was, after all, a top-tier expert in the Necro Dao, sensing the presence of many powerful entities in the river, eager to emerge.

Not only him, but the South King also sensed it, her expression changing slightly.

The North King laughed loudly!

He roared, "Those in the Celestial River of Death, the humans wish to unify the heavens once more. If you do not submit, you will die! If you still possess wisdom, you should know the danger. If I die, can you resist them?"

"Only by joining forces! Intimidate the humans, or even annihilate them!"

The North King saw an opportunity, a chance for survival.

He couldn't wait. If he waited until his side was killed and those fools emerged to take advantage, it would be too foolish, merely feeding Su Yu's forces!

Flying towards them, Su Yu glanced back at the Celestial River of Death.

In the river, eyes seemed to appear, watching them.

Su Yu sighed internally.

Plans couldn't keep up with changes!

Too many variables, these guys just wouldn't obediently submit, be suppressed, or killed.

They had to stir up trouble to be happy!

In the distance, the North King roared again, "Do those in the river not understand the situation? The East King was killed, the West King was killed, now it's my turn! If I'm killed, even if one or two Heavenly Kings and dozens of Necrolords emerge, the outcome will be the same!"

"My greatest regret is not joining forces with the East King back then to eliminate the South King!"

He roared for a while, indeed regretting it.

Not regretting the rebellion, but regretting that he had thought too simply back then, not eliminating the South King.

Back then, they should have joined forces with the West King, the West King's Consort, and the East King's Consort to kill the South King, then kill Grandstar, instead of sitting and waiting for death as they were now!

"Are you done shouting?"

Su Yu coldly snorted, and the North King sneered, "Today, you can't kill me! Su Yu, if you dare to act, strong ones from the river will come to aid!"

"I've waited until now only to avoid unnecessary losses among my subordinates!"

Su Yu's face was cold. He had waited until now not because he couldn't take down the North King, but because he hoped to minimize casualties.

But now, the entities in the Celestial River of Death wanted to cause trouble.

He could sense several Necrolord auras emerging behind him.

Clearly, the strong ones in the river were aware of the situation and wanted to join forces with the North King to intimidate Su Yu's side.

"Since you've all awakened, I want to see how many strong ones can awaken in the river!"

The plan was perfect, but they wouldn't listen.

At this point, continue awakening!

At worst, turn this place into chaos!

"Obediently hide in the river, and there's still a way out. I hope you don't seek your own death!"

Su Yu snorted coldly and flew towards the North King again.

The North King's expression was grave, "Su Yu, do you insist on mutual destruction?"

"So what if it's mutual destruction?"

Killing intent surged from Su Yu, and he sneered, "Do you think I'm giving you face? I've fought battles of mutual destruction more than once. This time, I just wanted to smoothly flatten your North King's Palace. You have the audacity to squander the opportunity I gave you!"

Killing intent erupted on Su Yu's face. The next moment, he shouted, "South King, hold them for me! Spirit Suppression Army, follow me to kill!"

The Spirit Suppression Army was slightly stunned because Su Yu turned and ran.

Ran?

The North King was also stunned, but Su Yu instantly broke through the void, traversing it, and in a moment, reached the Celestial River of Death, shouting, "Die!"

A stroke swept across the heavens!

Foolish undead, floating on the surface of the Celestial River of Death, with the power of the Great Dao fluctuating, did you think I was blind?

Did you think my Heaven Gate opened for nothing?

Couldn't see you at all?

Still playing hide and seek with me, I'll kill you first!

Su Yu's shout echoed in all directions, "South King, at all costs, hold them for me. Once I clear the Celestial River of Death, I'll come to assist you!"

The South King only then came to her senses, as did the North King.

Both were shocked!

Was he crazy?

Su Yu... he actually led the Spirit Suppression Army to attack the Celestial River of Death!

Boom!

This time, Su Yu suddenly attacked, launching a surprise assault. Without even looking at the Celestial River of Death, he directly targeted a Necrolord. In the void, a pen spanned the heavens, and with a stroke, a cracking sound!

On the Necro Dao, a fused path was almost severed by this sudden stroke!

In the river, a surge of death energy instantly overflowed, and a Necrolord's body suddenly exploded halfway.

With boundless confusion, how did he discover me?

Little did he know, in Su Yu's eyes, these undead were like beacons in the dark.

Too conspicuous!

And you still want to ambush me?

Still want to take advantage?

What are you thinking!

A stroke nearly severed the opponent's path, and the sudden slaughter left the lurking Necrolord severely injured!

Moreover, Su Yu immediately traversed the void, and with the Human Lord Seal, a thunderous boom suppressed the void!

In the moment the Necrolord was severely injured, he transformed the pen into a blade, slashing down with a world-opening strike!

Boom!

In an instant, before the North King and others could join the battle, before Shan Qi and others could catch up, Su Yu, with one stroke, one seal, and one blade, killed a Necrolord on the spot!

Boom!

The explosion echoed through the river!

The Mark of Civilization swept across, and in an instant, all non-Eternal undead on the Celestial River of Death vanished, including the corpse of the undead marquis, which was swiftly collected by Su Yu. In that moment, the river fell silent, devoid of any sound. Tens of thousands of undead disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Only now did everyone react, awakening from their stupor, faces filled with shock. An undead marquis had perished? It happened too quickly. Su Yu, ignoring the North Heavenly King, had taken the initiative to attack the Celestial River of Death! It was unbelievable!

Even the North Heavenly King was momentarily stunned. Damn, this madman had actually declared war on the Celestial River of Death. How could this be possible?

...

Impossible was exactly what Su Yu aimed for. Instead of waiting defensively, he chose to strike first. Having sensed the presence of these entities, he wouldn't give them the chance to ambush him. He wasn't foolish.

Not only that, but the next moment, a massive old turtle broke through the void.

"Emperor Yu..." the old turtle called out, a mix of surprise and confusion in its voice. Engaging in battle with the undead of the river? This wasn't part of the plan!

"Have the Great Qin King and the others arrived?" Su Yu asked.

"They're on standby..." came the reply.

Su Yu shouted, "Everyone, come in! Doesn't it take time for the undead to revive? As long as we kill faster than they can revive, I won't let a single one of them come back to life in this damned place!"

Upon hearing this, the aura of living beings erupted from afar!

Boom!

The Great Qin King and his forces had arrived!

Meanwhile, Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, and in the next moment, the old turtle's eyes connected with Su Yu's, as if seeing lines stretching out. Su Yu commanded, "Wherever you see a line, it must connect to an undead marquis. Go and kill them! The Celestial River of Death relies on secrecy, but how strong can it really be? I, Su Yu, don't believe it. Kill them for me!"

"Understood!"

In an instant, the Great Qin King and his forces entered, causing the entire Celestial River of Death to tremble violently. Countless undead were stimulated, beginning to revive. But Su Yu's strategy was clear: as long as they killed faster than the undead could revive, they had nothing to fear!

The old turtle instantly traversed the void, appearing on one of the lines. He hadn't sensed any powerful presence there, but Su Yu had endowed him with some characteristics of the Heaven Gate, allowing him to see the line. Trusting Su Yu, he acted without hesitation!

Without a word, the old turtle's shell transformed into a mountain, pressing down with immense force!

Below, in the Celestial River of Death, only weak undead were visible. The old turtle hadn't seen any powerful entities yet, but that didn't stop him from trusting Su Yu. This strike was executed with full force!

Boom!

With a loud crash, the next moment, the Great Dao trembled, and an undead marquis was blasted out, shattered into pieces by the old turtle's mountain-like shell, its Dao body fleeing!

The old turtle was shocked!

Damn!

There really was one here?

This was terrifying!

The most formidable aspect of the Celestial River of Death lay in its mystery, its unpredictability, and the uncertainty of whether powerful undead lurked below. Unfortunately, at this moment, these powerful undead were preparing to act, their Daos connected.

If they chose to completely suppress themselves and not disturb the Great Dao, they wouldn't be in a state to act at any moment. Once they decided to act, they couldn't achieve instant kills.

Despite his shock, the old turtle was a top-tier existence in terms of strength! The undead marquis he had severely injured was locked in place by him, unable to escape.

The turtle shell mountain pressed down once more!

Boom!

The fleeing undead marquis was crushed under his mountain!

The Great Dao trembled!

Never before had the old turtle found it so easy to kill an undead marquis.

Meanwhile, in the distance, Su Yu continuously opened the Heaven Gate, small Heaven Gates appearing above the heads of the arriving guardians and on the foreheads of the Great Qin King and his forces.

"Wherever you see lines, there are powerful entities. Kill them all!"

"Understood!"

The Great Qin King and his forces immediately saw numerous lines. Without needing further instructions from Su Yu, they dispersed in all directions, and the entire Celestial River of Death erupted into battle in an instant!

Boom!

Undead marquises continuously emerged, filled with shock and confusion. What was happening?

In the blink of an eye, Su Yu and the old turtle had already slain two undead marquises, and they hadn't even had time to react.

On one hand, Su Yu was incredibly bold, directly leading his forces into the Celestial River of Death. On the other hand, these people somehow knew their locations.

...

In the North King's Palace.

The North Heavenly King and his followers were dumbfounded, bewildered by Su Yu's actions. Su Yu hadn't come to attack the North King's Palace but had instead gone straight to assault the Celestial River of Death. They had been thinking that if they were defeated, they could retreat to the Celestial River of Death.

But...

The North Heavenly King, being a titled Heavenly King, had a change in expression, as if realizing something. The Heaven Gate—yes, Su Yu had opened the Heaven Gate!

He roared, "He's opened the Heaven Gate! Your concealment is useless. Don't expose your Great Dao power..."

Boom!

The South Heavenly King attacked, her expression cold as she shouted, "Since the Human Lord can't come, we'll do the killing! Foolish creatures, if you don't expose your Great Dao power, you'll die even faster. Do they dare?"

The North Heavenly King hesitated!

The next moment, he roared in anger, a large blade appearing as he charged forward, "Kill her!"

The North Heavenly King bellowed, "There are countless powerful entities in the Celestial River of Death. Su Yu and his forces can't take the river. More living beings entering will only awaken more undead marquises!"

Su Yu hoped to suppress the Celestial River of Death with this method, but it wouldn't work!

How many could he kill?

...

How many could he kill?

Su Yu didn't know. Who knew how many powerful entities were in the Celestial River of Death, how many were in slumber, how many were waiting for the chance to revive?

At this moment, the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, the Great Ming King, Heavendoom, the Book Spirit, the Tea Plant, and the old turtle had all entered!

Ten Daofuse experts!

Nine of them couldn't hide their living auras, only the old turtle didn't need to conceal his.

The stimulation caused a large number of undead to begin reviving!

Lines continued to increase!

These were powerful entities connecting to the Great Dao, and the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King swept through the area. The two didn't separate but joined forces, sweeping through, and an undead marquis hiding well was directly smashed out by the Heaven and Earth Inkstone, instantly shattered into pieces!

With a loud boom, the Dao body exploded, and a blade and a spear struck, instantly killing the opponent.

How strong could a newly revived undead be?

No matter how powerful an ancient Daofuse expert was, if they had just revived, they were still vulnerable!

At this moment, in the distance, an incredibly powerful presence roared, "Everyone, gather at my location!"

Damn it!

This was that powerful presence, Cangshan Ming. He had just finished discussing with those undead marquises, finally persuading everyone. They had planned to wait for the battle to break out and then attack from behind. Who would have thought that this generation's Human Lord would directly charge in!

In the blink of an eye, four or five undead marquises scattered in the river had been killed!

Too fast!

So fast that Cangshan Ming was caught off guard, feeling at a loss!

Damn it, how could this happen?

He had just negotiated with over a dozen undead marquises, and now four or five had been killed.

...

Su Yu's sudden, decisive strike against the Celestial River of Death caught everyone off guard.

Everyone had expected him to be defensive, but instead, he led his forces straight in!

At this moment, Su Yu was accompanied by a few individuals.

Su Yu casually tossed out an undead imprint, speaking in a low voice, "Hetu, consume it!"

Hetu, who had just gone to report and called the old turtle, didn't say much. It was the imprint of the undead marquis Su Yu had just killed. He consumed it!

Being undead, he didn't need to kill in the Luminous Domain Mansion like the guardians.

Hetu swallowed the imprint, his aura growing stronger.

Meanwhile, Su Yu's eyes flickered, and he pointed with his pen into the void once more. Boom!

Deep in the riverbed, an undead marquis spat black blood, and without a word, without showing itself, it instantly withdrew all its Great Dao power, its aura rapidly declining, fleeing from the river in a hurry!

Too terrifying!

Before Su Yu's eyes, the Great Dao power the opponent had connected to vanished.

Now, at most, that entity could unleash Sunmoon Realm power, perhaps a bit of Eternal power, but it dared not use its Great Dao power.

The Heaven Gate was the perfect weapon against these hidden powerhouses!

Hide?

Where could they hide!

Unless they didn't use the power of laws!

Further away, the old turtle was facing off against Cangshan Ming, and the battle was intense. Another peerless powerhouse, likely at the Heavenly King level.

Su Yu didn't care; it wasn't surprising to encounter Heavenly King-level opponents.

He couldn't worry about too much now. If these entities gathered, it would be troublesome. While they were newly revived, not fully conscious, unaware of fear or death, it was the best time to kill them!

The Mark of Civilization covered the heavens and earth!

Devour!

Countless undead were directly devoured into the Mark of Civilization, and the entire river, once filled with countless undead, was now empty before Su Yu!

The Mark of Civilization was also overflowing with death energy.

A large number of undead were slain by Su Yu!

He gazed at the North King's Palace in the distance, where a battle had also erupted.

The forces were evenly matched, with one Heavenly King and fourteen undead marquises on each side. It would be difficult to determine a victor in a short time.

It all depended on his side!

Su Yu was extremely frustrated. He had planned everything well, but it was all ruined by this group of trash. They insisted on reviving, and not only that, they wanted to take advantage of the situation. Dream on!

If he didn't kill the North Heavenly King today, he would make sure to eliminate these guys!

Boom!

Battles raged everywhere!

Ten Daofuse experts descended, along with twenty-seven guardians, Su Yu, and nearly a hundred undead lords. Such a formidable force had entered the river, stirring up massive waves!

Since the ancient wars, no one had ever dared to enter the river!

In everyone's eyes, the river was mysterious, powerful, dangerous...

But Su Yu had come!

He didn't follow the expected pattern of besieging the North King's Palace first and then waiting for the hidden powerhouses to strike from behind. Instead, he charged straight in!

Not only that, but the next moment, Su Yu shouted, "Abandon the North King's Domain, South Heavenly King, Lanshan, lead the forces to the river. I want to flatten this river!"

"..."

The South Heavenly King, who was engaged with the North Heavenly King, was momentarily stunned. What was this?

Even the North Heavenly King was taken aback.

Not attacking me?

Going to attack the Celestial River of Death instead?

This... this... what should I do?

Should I go help?

Su Yu was on a rampage, summoning a horde of living beings, even those at the Daofuse level, to join him. It seemed as though the enemies from the Celestial River of Death were even more detestable than those on his side. What should be done now?

The South Heavenly King frowned, about to say something when Marquis Lanshan struck down an opposing marquis and shouted, "To the Celestial River of Death!"

"Stop them!" The North Heavenly King roared, now intent on entangling the South Heavenly King and his allies. He couldn't let them leave; if they truly pacified the Celestial River of Death, his side would be at a disadvantage.

However, his subordinates, the necromancer marquises, were not pleased. To be honest, Su Yu was a terrifying figure, having charged directly into the Celestial River of Death and summoned numerous powerful living beings. They were worried. That dog hadn't even arrived yet! How many more powerful beings were waiting in the living realm? Moreover, Su Yu was too ruthless! Even the undead dared not venture into the river, yet Su Yu had charged in!

Following the North Heavenly King felt like a path to passive defeat. A single misstep could lead to their demise. Now that the South Heavenly King and his allies seemed disinterested in fighting, should they seize the opportunity to flee, or... what should they do?

Escape to the Land of the Abyss! Although dangerous, it felt safer than staying here. While they were still contemplating, the necromancer marquis fighting Marquis Lanshan was feeling utterly frustrated. Marquis Lanshan's strength had increased significantly, completely suppressing him and causing him to crumble repeatedly.

He was no match for Marquis Lanshan! Now, Marquis Lanshan was even more invigorated, eager to assist Su Yu, and his explosive power increased by threefold, forcing his opponent into a continuous retreat! How could he continue fighting like this?

The North Heavenly King frowned repeatedly, entangled with the South Heavenly King, while the latter was filled with murderous intent. However, his subordinates lacked the same killing intent. Previously, they felt cornered, fighting with their backs against the wall, displaying great bravery. Now that the South Heavenly King and his allies wanted to leave, their morale plummeted, and several necromancer marquises kept glancing at the North Heavenly King.

Should they continue blocking them? Perhaps it would be better to let them go; they might all perish in the Celestial River of Death anyway!

"Heavenly King, perhaps we should abandon the interception. Once they leave, we have the option to retreat or stay; we have a way out!"

The North Heavenly King was shaken! This was troublesome! At this moment, they hadn't suffered any losses, yet their morale had dissipated instantly. The resolve to fight to the death was gone, even among the marquises of the gods, demons, and immortals.

Perhaps... they should stop blocking them? Marquis Lanshan and his allies were incredibly fierce, filled with killing intent. No one knew how many powerful beings resided in the Celestial River of Death. It might be better to let them fight it out while they watched from the sidelines.

They were unfamiliar with the powerful beings in the Celestial River of Death! Why should they risk their lives to intercept formidable enemies for them?

"Heavenly King, there are countless powerful beings in the Celestial River of Death. If the South Heavenly King and his allies want to court death, why should we stop them? We would only lose our lives in vain..."

Boom!

At that moment, Marquis Lanshan pierced through the necromancer marquis he was fighting with a single strike! The other necromancer marquises, witnessing this, grew even more anxious.

"Heavenly King, if we continue blocking them, we will suffer casualties. It's better to join forces while we still have strength. Once we reach the Land of the Abyss, we can still hold our ground!"

"Yes, Heavenly King, with you and 14 Daofuse experts, even in the Land of the Abyss, we have nothing to fear! Previously, we were surrounded, and breaking through meant death. Now they want to leave!"

Several marquises couldn't hold back any longer, even considering that if the Heavenly King didn't agree, they might... defect!

Previously, they had no choice but to stay when surrounded, knowing that fleeing would result in death. Now, the South Heavenly King and his allies didn't want to fight them, so why not escape?

"The situation is lost!"

The North Heavenly King felt a deep sense of sorrow! He hadn't been defeated, nor had his subordinates. Not a single necromancer marquis had died, and he was even suppressing the South Heavenly King. However... he knew the situation was lost!

He couldn't hold onto the North King's Domain! He didn't know if Su Yu had done it intentionally. If Su Yu had withdrawn from the siege without reason, these necromancer marquises wouldn't dare to scatter recklessly.

But now, Su Yu was waging war against the Celestial River of Death! His subordinates had seen it and knew it! They knew Su Yu couldn't spare the effort to pursue them, and their morale crumbled instead!

What... what was this? Defeating the enemy without fighting? Losing the North King's Domain, and once Su Yu consolidated the Four Kings' Domains, they would have almost no hope of reclaiming it, as they would have lost legitimacy and the power of law suppression.

Moreover, from now on, it would be difficult for them to replenish their forces, as they were far from the entrance to the living realm. The North Heavenly King felt truly desolate for a moment. It was even more desolate than being defeated!

He hadn't lost yet; Su Yu hadn't even attacked, yet his army's morale was gone. He wanted to roar, "If we stop the South Heavenly King and his allies now, Su Yu might be defeated!"

Just as he was about to shout, Su Yu's voice echoed from afar, "Come, take my command and summon the Daofuse experts of all races to enter the Death Realm and wage war! Summon billions of troops to flatten this realm. I refuse to believe that the living cannot defeat the dead!"

"Yes!" Soon, a response echoed, and some necromancer monarchs in the distance quickly ran towards the various garrisoned areas.

The necromancer marquises under the North Heavenly King grew even more terrified.

"My lord, let's flee! This man has gone mad. If he truly summons the Daofuse experts of all races to attack, even if he suffers heavy losses and fails in the river, he has a way out. But we... have no way out!"

The army's morale had already crumbled! Below, some necromancer monarchs even began to flee, heading towards the Land of the Abyss. In the next moment, the North Heavenly King let out a soft sigh, filled with indescribable desolation and helplessness.

What was happening! Su Yu was fighting the Celestial River of Death, increasing his enemies, yet his side was the first to crumble!

Damn it!

"Make way!" The North Heavenly King uttered in a low voice, choosing to retreat! There was no other choice!

The South Heavenly King was slightly taken aback. They were letting them through? Not blocking them anymore? The necromancer marquises had communicated through sound transmission, so the South Heavenly King hadn't heard. At this moment, she was somewhat surprised and worried it was a delaying tactic. However, Marquis Lanshan didn't care much, truly ignoring the North Heavenly King, and shouted, "To the river to assist in battle!"

"Yes!" A group of necromancer marquises, along with the monarchs below, ignored their opponents and flew towards the river!

The South Heavenly King hesitated for a moment, feeling helpless. Fine! She couldn't understand the human race's way of thinking. They had agreed to fight the North Heavenly King, so why were they going to fight the Celestial River of Death instead? There was no choice but to follow along!

This time, no one stopped them! Watching them leave, a necromancer marquis quickly looked at the North Heavenly King and said, "Heavenly King, let's retreat!"

The North Heavenly King looked at the North King's Domain below... filled with silent sorrow. Retreat! He hadn't even been defeated. Previously, he had held onto the North King's Domain, but now... he was about to lose it?

He was truly unwilling! However, these necromancer marquises didn't care about that anymore. If they didn't retreat now, would they wait for Su Yu and his allies to win and come back to kill them?

Regardless of the outcome, everyone felt that staying here was courting death. The North Heavenly King sighed, and in the next moment, exhausted, he said, "Retreat!"

To the Land of the Abyss! His subordinates were a bunch of rabble, no wonder they couldn't match the human race in the past. Damn bastards! He was being coerced by them, yet he had no choice. If he didn't retreat with them, staying alone would probably make Su Yu laugh himself to death!

At this moment, the North Heavenly King didn't care about much else. Taking advantage of the South Heavenly King and his allies' retreat, the North Heavenly King grabbed countless undead with a large hand, covering the sky and earth. Even in retreat, he had to take a group of elite soldiers with him!

Otherwise, in the Land of the Abyss, there might be no reinforcements! He understood that strong individuals were born from the weak. Other necromancer marquises also took their elite undead armies with them, and in the blink of an eye, the entire North King's Domain was empty.

The North Heavenly King, filled with infinite anger and sorrow, took one last look at the Celestial River of Death. As the South Heavenly King and her allies charged in, the sky changed color. Fifteen powerful beings entered, and in the blink of an eye, two or three necromancer marquises were killed!

The North Heavenly King hesitated no longer and shouted, "Go, to the Land of the Abyss!"

A gust of black wind swept through, and fifteen powerful beings, along with a large number of undead, quickly fled towards the endless darkness of the Land of the Abyss!

Not a single one died! It was something to be happy about, but... it was hard to truly feel joy. As the North Heavenly King flew away, he glanced at the Celestial River of Death, wondering if Su Yu had anticipated this outcome.

Did he have the South Heavenly King and her allies assist in battle to shake his side's morale? If so, then the defeat wasn't undeserved! If not, then the defeat felt somewhat unjust.

...

In the Celestial River of Death.

Su Yu shouted, "Capture the necromancer marquises alive! Capture them alive if possible!"

As for the North Heavenly King's escape, wasn't it expected? If he didn't flee, his necromancer marquises would have to. Would they choose to fight to the death with him, or seize the opportunity to escape? Su Yu could guess even with his eyes closed.

It was part of Su Yu's strategy. However, this wasn't the outcome Su Yu desired. He wanted to conquer the North King's Domain and kill the North Heavenly King, but now he had to resort to this method, forcing them to flee. He could only choose to kill some powerful beings in the river to make up for the loss!

Annihilating the North Heavenly King without alerting the powerful beings in the river was the best strategy. Killing the North Heavenly King and then having the Celestial River of Death erupt was the middle strategy in Su Yu's eyes. Now, fighting the Celestial River of Death and allowing the North Heavenly King and his allies to escape was the worst outcome in Su Yu's mind.

It wasn't that he had to kill the North Heavenly King, but these necromancers might collude with the outside world. Their intelligence was higher, making them more challenging to deal with than the newly awakened powerful beings in the river!

Even if the necromancers in the river reached the Heavenly King level, Su Yu felt they were quite foolish. Having just awakened, how much intelligence could they have? Did they know anything about the past ten thousand years? What were they fighting against him for?

Su Yu didn't care about those matters. When Marquis Lanshan arrived, he quickly led several marquises to sweep through the Celestial River of Death, continuously killing and capturing necromancer marquises alive by shattering their Dao bodies!

Sweeping the river! The same was happening in other directions, with continuous slaughter! Further away, the powerful Cangshan Ming was bewildered. The South Heavenly King had arrived! The South Heavenly King and the old turtle joined forces, causing him to crumble repeatedly and flee quickly, only to be pursued relentlessly by the two powerful beings, leaving him with no escape.

He was puzzled! Why? He truly didn't understand. He had just awakened, gathered a group of powerful beings, and hadn't even left the river. How did it come to this? What about that North Heavenly King? Why did he flee? Wasn't he just proclaiming with confidence that they shared a common fate?

Chapter 695: The Battle's Turning Point

"Damn it! I actually believed their nonsense! They were supposed to join forces against the Human Race, but instead, they fled!"

With the addition of 15 new Daofuse cultivators, there were now a total of 25 Daofuse Realm experts, along with 27 Guardians and Su Yu. Such a formidable force was equivalent to 40 ordinary Daofuse cultivators!

Cangshan Ming knew that he had only managed to gather about 15 before, and six or seven of them had already been killed! Although the dead spirits continued to revive, they couldn't keep up with the speed of these killings. Some unfortunate souls, upon reviving, instinctively connected to the power of the Great Dao, instantly exposing themselves. In the distance, the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King were having a field day, smashing yet another newly revived dead spirit marquis to pieces!

The Great Xia King, having just killed one, suddenly changed his expression. "A Human Marquis?"

The one he had just killed seemed to have a human form. Could he have accidentally killed a Human Marquis? Although the newly revived might not consider themselves part of the Human Race, given time, they might stabilize their original mindset.

The Great Qin King was also startled. After carefully examining the shattered corpse, he breathed a sigh of relief. "No, it should be a God Race Marquis! Old Xia, be careful. Capture them alive if possible! Don't kill the Human Dead Spirit Marquis!"

"Got it!"

The Great Xia King was also frightened. Although the killing was satisfying, he almost made a grave mistake. Quickly, he asked, "Old Qin, isn't this exhilarating?"

The Great Qin King grinned but said nothing. It was exhilarating! But he wouldn't admit it! It was truly satisfying to kill without restraint here, with dozens of Human Race experts sweeping through the feared Celestial River of Death. Such a scene had only occurred in ancient times!

And today, Su Yu led them in this unrestrained slaughter! Of course, it was exhilarating! In these battles, they were always the ones encircling others, not the other way around. They were always in control, unlike before when the Human Race was always so humble, fighting one against two or even three, always with a do-or-die mentality!

Fighting such a one-sided battle was naturally much more satisfying! The dead spirits revived, but not as fast as they were being killed. As Su Yu had said, as long as they killed faster than the spirits could revive, what was the point of the revival?

Normally, they couldn't see the revival process. They would only know when the spirits had fully revived. But now, they could see the lines appearing in their eyes, indicating where the strong ones were reviving! This allowed them to kill even faster!

As they continued killing, the number of strong dead spirits dwindled!

...

At this moment, Su Yu also reached Cangshan Ming's location. The South Heavenly King saw Su Yu approaching and quickly transmitted a message, "We can't keep killing. If we continue, the ones reviving won't just be Dead Spirit Marquises and Heavenly Kings! I've already felt my strength improving rapidly!"

Improving strength was good! But it also meant they had killed too many, leaving a vast empty space in the Great Dao, enough to support the birth of a Human King-level expert!

Meanwhile, the dead spirit lords Su Yu brought with him were also growing stronger. The South Heavenly King quickly transmitted, "Stop killing. Let them consume the marks of the slain Dead Spirit Marquises to advance and occupy the positions in the Great Dao! Those who can advance, do so quickly to fill the void! Let the living retreat; we'll hold this person off for now without killing him!"

Killing Cangshan Ming might indeed lead to the birth of an existence surpassing a Heavenly King!

Su Yu's expression changed slightly. He quickly shouted, "Regroup! The living, retreat!"

As he spoke, some Guardians arrived from behind. Some had captured newly revived Dead Spirit Marquises, while others carried dead spirit marks. Su Yu looked at Hetu and quickly said, "Give the dead spirit marks to Hetu!"

He swiftly added, "Hetu, hurry and advance to Daofuse!"

Occupy the territory!

He then shouted, "Lanshan, devour everything and find a way to reach the Heavenly King level!"

Lanshan was too slow. She had consumed the East Heavenly King, parts of the West Heavenly King, and many Dead Spirit Marquis marks, yet she was only slightly stronger than a typical Marquis, not reaching the Heavenly King level!

Lanshan Marquis didn't think much of it. More to eat? She felt a bit embarrassed! But since His Majesty said so, she decided to eat a bit more!

Hetu, on the other hand, seemed to understand something. He glanced at Su Yu, his heart trembling slightly, but he said nothing and quickly began devouring the dead spirit marks.

While devouring, he remarked, "That fool Xia Chen ran away. Otherwise, he could have taken this opportunity to reach Daofuse too..."

As he spoke, a distant Great Dao trembled slightly. Su Yu glanced in that direction. Xia Chen? Did he reach Daofuse? Was it Xia Chen? It seemed likely!

...

Meanwhile, in a faraway place, almost at the Ruins of Return, Xia Chen had indeed advanced. It was surprisingly easy! He hadn't expected it to be so effortless today. With just a bit of cultivation, he advanced!

On the other side, Liu Hong was also surprised. Soon, his aura flickered briefly, and he said strangely, "Is there another fight outside? Why do I feel like my fusion speed has increased significantly?"

"Did the Dead Spirit Great Dao tremble?"

Liu Hong was extremely surprised. Xia Chen, however, said nothing, instead asking seriously, "What's going on with you?"

Liu Hong grinned, "I just fused recently, but this Ink Dao is a bit tricky!"

"Hmm?"

Liu Hong sighed, "I seem to have been tricked. The Ink Dao... is eroding the Dead Spirit Great Dao! This might have been something the Culture King prepared to counter the Dead Spirit Great Dao. How am I supposed to compete with the Dead Spirit Great Dao with my little strength?"

He was also frustrated! It was much trickier than he had anticipated! The Ink Dao was strong, but it had some dead spirit characteristics, seemingly intended to invade the Dead Spirit Great Dao.

The Culture King was too cunning, preparing this to have someone master the Ink Dao and clash with the Dead Spirit Great Dao? Even he might not be able to handle it!

Liu Hong felt exhausted! They really overestimated him. If he had known, he would have given this thing to Su Yu and let that madman clash with the Dead Spirit Great Dao!

Also, today, the fusion was much easier. Did the Dead Spirit Great Dao tremble? Was it Su Yu's doing? Apart from Su Yu, he couldn't think of anyone else.
