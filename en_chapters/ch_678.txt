Chapter 678: Beating the Disobedient (Seeking Subscription)

All twenty-seven garrisons had advanced to the ninth-stage.

Before leaving, Su Yu had provoked the Martial Emperor, hoping the man would be driven mad by his taunts. After all, once that fellow sobered up, he even learned to annoy Su Yu.

If it was a fight, then a fight it was. Who was afraid of whom?

“Hmph!”

Teleporting out, Su Yu sneered.

The Martial Emperor… was powerful, but that was only if he got out. If he didn't, who would fear him?

The garrisons around him, including the monarchs, didn't actually know what Su Yu had done. At this moment, they were all a little puzzled; Su Yu seemed very pleased, yet also somewhat displeased.

So complicated!

Hetu didn't bother with such thoughts and quickly said, “Your Majesty, now that Shan Qi and the others have all advanced, should we go to war with the North Heavenly King?”

In the current situation, attacking the North Heavenly King would definitely lead to victory.

The only question was how great the losses would be.

Su Yu had waited for all these garrisons to advance precisely to annihilate the enemy without losses, but in battle, no one could predict the outcome.

Su Yu didn't speak, glancing at the Celestial River of Death beside him.

He had already sensed danger.

Su Yu wasn't foolish; he naturally knew that Death Hou had appeared internally, perhaps lying in wait. Once they went to war with the North Heavenly King, these fellows might emerge to snatch a bargain.

He wasn't too clear on the exact number.

“Let's go!”

Su Yu said no more, deciding to head there first!

In an instant, the group flew towards the opposite side of the Celestial River of Death. Powerful auras surged. Below the Celestial River of Death, there were indeed Death Hou monitoring them. Su Yu vaguely sensed them and sneered inwardly, *Want to take advantage of me?*

*Dream on!*

Among the crowd, Hetu received a voice transmission and quickly departed, flying towards Grand Dream City.

…

The North Heavenly King grew increasingly uneasy!

Damn it, in such a short time, he felt as if Su Yu had returned!

The North Heavenly King quickly rose into the air, looking towards the Celestial River of Death region of the North Heavenly King's Domain. Soon, his expression changed, and he murmured, “Garrisons!”

He seemed to have seen those garrisons!

At this moment, other Death Hou also flew out one after another, all looking in that direction. In the distance, a golden light flashed—it was Su Yu!

The group of Death Hou changed color.

Su Yu had brought the garrisons?

The North Heavenly King quickly said in a low voice, “Don't worry! Heavendoom and those other Daofuse garrisons aren't here, and Grand Dream won't leave. Only some Eternal garrisons have come!”

Don't be afraid!

He reassured these Death Hou, telling them not to worry, that everything would be fine.

But he himself was extremely uneasy!

The garrisons, this group of garrisons, seemed to have all grown stronger than before. Although they couldn't match Daofuse experts, several of them working together could resist one Daofuse expert.

Big trouble!

Was Su Yu crazy?

Taking these garrisons away, wasn't he afraid of the outside world finding out?

Or… had those idiots outside been replaced by Su Yu without their knowledge?

He could only think this way!

Otherwise, it would be almost impossible for so many garrisons to leave at once.

“We might have to flee!”

The North Heavenly King actually knew what was coming. He felt somewhat helpless and annoyed.

If it came to it, he would flee.

Once Su Yu brought his people, it would be difficult to escape.

It wasn't just him thinking this; the other Death Hou weren't fools.

At this moment, they were all thinking the same thing.

In the distance, Su Yu's booming voice spread across the heavens and earth: “Do you still want to stubbornly resist? To execute traitors, what I said before still stands! North Heavenly King, if you disperse your dao now, you still have a chance. Once you make a move, you will surely die!”

The grand voice echoed throughout the North Heavenly King's Domain.

Within the North Heavenly King's Domain, those monarchs with intelligence were extremely terrified.

On the other side, the South Heavenly King's cold voice came: “North Heavenly King, why haven't you surrendered? Do you wish to be executed?”

At this moment, the North Heavenly King felt like he was at the end of his rope!

He glanced at the Death Hou beside him, then at the monarchs below. He still had a chance.

Flee now!

The South Heavenly King would find it difficult to catch him. He could escape to the Celestial River of Death, or even to the Land of Return to Emptiness. His strength was not weak; even if he escaped to the Land of Return to Emptiness, he might not be in danger.

Su Yu had no intention of fighting him to the death; he merely wanted to use overwhelming force to compel him to surrender, or to flatten the North Heavenly King's Residence with the strongest possible stance, unwilling to suffer excessive losses himself.

Flee?

Leaving the North Heavenly King's Residence, which he had managed for years, to become an ignorant, wandering death spirit again?

He had been like this in life.

Must he be like this in death?

The North Heavenly King looked towards the Celestial River of Death and suddenly smiled.

“Su Yu!”

The North Heavenly King's laughter shook the heavens. “You are ultimately just a weakling! You can rely on the South Heavenly King to suppress me, but you cannot suppress this world! This world will eventually rebel! In the past, when the Human Emperor, Culture King, and Martial King were alive, who dared to disobey wherever they went?”

“You… are still too weak. Whether living beings or death spirits, who would willingly submit to you?”

“The stronger your subordinates, the more interesting it will be when they turn against you!”

“Even if you defeat me, you won't conquer this world!”

The North Heavenly King laughed heartily. He felt it; the Celestial River of Death was surging violently. He was, after all, a top-tier expert in the death dao. It seemed there were many powerful experts in the Celestial River of Death who wanted to emerge.

Not just him, the South Heavenly King also sensed it, her expression slightly changing.

The North Heavenly King laughed loudly!

He roared, “All you in the Celestial River of Death, don't you understand the situation? The East Heavenly King was killed, the West Heavenly King was killed, and now it's my turn! If I am killed, even if one or two Heavenly Kings and dozens of Death Hou emerge from the river, you will all suffer the same fate!”

“Only by joining forces can we deter the human race, or even eliminate them!”

The North Heavenly King saw an opportunity, an opportunity to survive.

He couldn't wait. Waiting for his side to be killed, and then for those fools to come out and pick up scraps, would be too foolish. That would just be continuously feeding Su Yu and his allies!

Su Yu, who was flying over, looked back at the Celestial River of Death.

In the river, eyes seemed to emerge, looking towards them.

Su Yu sighed inwardly!

Plans never kept up with changes!

There were too many variables. These fellows just weren't willing to be obediently subdued, suppressed, or killed by him.

They just had to cause trouble to be happy!

In the distance, the North Heavenly King roared again, “Do you in the Celestial River of Death still not understand the situation? The East Heavenly King was killed, the West Heavenly King was killed, and now it's my turn! If I am killed, even if one or two Heavenly Kings and dozens of Death Hou emerge from the river, you will all suffer the same fate!”

“My biggest regret is not having joined forces with the East Heavenly King and the others to eliminate the South Heavenly King earlier!”

He roared for a while. Yes, he had some regrets.

Not regretting his rebellion, but regretting that he had thought too simply back then, and hadn't killed the South Heavenly King.

Back then, he should have joined forces with the West Heavenly King, West King's Consort, and East Heavenly King's Consort to kill the South Heavenly King, and then Grand Dream, instead of sitting idly by as he was now!

“Are you done shouting?”

Su Yu coldly snorted. The North Heavenly King also sneered, “Today, you cannot kill me! Su Yu, if you dare to attack, powerful experts from the Celestial River will surely come to my aid!”

“I've waited until now simply because I didn't want to needlessly expend my subordinates' strength!”

Su Yu's face was cold. He had waited until now not because he couldn't defeat the North Heavenly King, but because he hoped to lose fewer people.

But it turned out well; the fellows in the Celestial River of Death wanted to cause trouble again.

He could already sense several Death Hou auras emerging behind him.

Clearly, the experts in the Celestial River knew the situation and wanted to join forces with the North Heavenly King to deter Su Yu's side.

“Since you've all revived, I also want to see how many experts can revive in the Celestial River!”

The plan was perfect, but they were disobedient.

At this point, let them continue to revive!

At worst, he would turn this place into a mess!

“If you obediently hide in the Celestial River, you still have a way out. I hope you don't seek your own demise!”

Su Yu coldly snorted and flew towards the North Heavenly King again.

The North Heavenly King's expression was grave. “Su Yu, do you insist on a mutually destructive battle?”

“What if it's a mutually destructive battle?”

Su Yu's killing intent suddenly soared, and he sneered, “Am I giving you too much face? I've fought mutually destructive battles more than once. This time, I just wanted to smoothly flatten your North Heavenly King's Residence. You have such gall, I gave you a chance, but you repeatedly failed to cherish it!”

Su Yu's face erupted with ferocity. The next moment, he roared, “South Heavenly King, you all tie him down for me! Spirit Suppressing Army, follow me and kill!”

The Spirit Suppressing Army was slightly stunned, because Su Yu had turned and fled.

Fled?

The North Heavenly King was also momentarily dumbfounded, but Su Yu instantly broke through the void, traversing through it, and in an instant, arrived at the Celestial River of Death. He let out a low roar: “Die!”

One stroke swept across heaven and earth!

Foolish death spirits, you float on the surface of the Celestial River of Death, your dao power fluctuating. Do you think I'm blind?

Do you think I opened my Heaven Gate for nothing?

Can't see you at all?

Still playing hide-and-seek with me? I'll kill you first!

Su Yu's roar echoed in all directions, “South Heavenly King, at all costs, trap them for me! After I flatten the Celestial River of Death, I'll come to your aid!”

Only then did the South Heavenly King come to her senses, and so did the North Heavenly King.

Both were utterly shocked!

Was he crazy?!

Su Yu… he actually led the Spirit Suppressing Army directly into the Celestial River of Death!

Boom!

This time, Su Yu suddenly turned back, launching a surprise attack. Without even looking at the Celestial River of Death, he directly pinpointed a Death Hou. In the void, a pen traversed heaven and earth, striking out with a single stroke, *Crack!*

On the death dao, a fused dao was directly severed in half by this sudden strike!

In the river, a surge of death qi instantly overflowed, and a Death Hou's dao body suddenly exploded by half.

Filled with infinite bewilderment, *How did he find me?*

Little did he know, in Su Yu's eyes, these death spirits were like lamps in the darkness.

Too conspicuous!

You lot, you want to ambush me?

And pick up scraps?

What are you thinking?!

One stroke nearly severed the opponent's dao. This sudden attack instantly severely wounded the lurking, monitoring Death Hou!

And Su Yu, the next moment, directly traversed the void. The Human Lord's Seal emerged, and with a rumble, it suppressed the void!

The instant that Death Hou was severely wounded, Su Yu transformed the pen into a blade, unleashing a heaven-splitting slash!

A thunderous boom!

In a true instant, before the North Heavenly King and his allies could join the battle, before Shan Qi and the others could even catch up, Su Yu, with one stroke, one seal, and one blade, killed a Death Hou on the spot with three moves!

Boom!

An explosion echoed through the river!

The Mark of Civilization swept out. In this instant, all non-Eternal death spirits on the entire Celestial River of Death instantly vanished, swept away by the Mark of Civilization. Even the Death Hou's corpse was taken by Su Yu.

In an instant, this section of the river fell silent!

Utterly silent!

Tens of thousands of death spirits vanished instantly.

Only at this moment did everyone react, coming to their senses, their faces filled with shock.

A Death Hou had died?

This… was too fast.

Su Yu actually ignored the North Heavenly King and actively charged into the Celestial River of Death!

It was unbelievable!

The North Heavenly King was also dumbfounded. *Damn it, this lunatic, he actually initiated a war with the Celestial River of Death.*

*How is that possible!*

…

*It's precisely because it's impossible that I did it!*

Rather than being on the defensive, it was better to take the initiative. Su Yu had already sensed the presence of these fellows; how could he give them a chance to ambush him from behind? He wasn't stupid.

Not only that, the next moment, a giant old turtle broke through the void.

“Emperor Yu…”

The old turtle called out, with some surprise and bewilderment. *Going to war with the death spirits in the river?*

*This wasn't part of the plan!*

“Have the Great Qin King and the others arrived?”

“Standing by…”

Su Yu roared, “Everyone, come in! Do death spirits not need time to revive? As long as we kill faster than they revive, I'll make sure not a single one of them can revive in this cursed place!”

As soon as these words were spoken, in the distance, the aura of living beings suddenly erupted!

Rumble!

The Great Qin King and the others had entered!

And Su Yu, with his Heaven Gate open, the next moment, the old turtle's eyes connected with Su Yu's. He seemed to see lines. Su Yu roared, “Every line you see must connect to a Death Hou! Go kill them! Pinpoint and kill! Isn't the Celestial River of Death all about secrecy? How strong can they really be? I, Su Yu, don't believe it! Kill them for me!”

“Understood!”

In an instant, the Great Qin King and the others all entered. The entire Celestial River of Death violently surged, and countless death spirits were stimulated, beginning to revive.

And what Su Yu said was, as long as they killed faster than the experts revived, they wouldn't fear their revival!

The old turtle instantly traversed the void, appearing along one of the lines.

He hadn't actually sensed any powerful experts here.

But he had been endowed with some Heaven Gate characteristics by Su Yu, seeing a line. He didn't care; he just trusted Su Yu!

Without another word, the old turtle's shell transformed into a mountain, suppressing downwards!

Below, in the Celestial River of Death, he only saw some weak death spirits. He still hadn't seen any powerful beings, but that didn't stop him from trusting Su Yu. This strike was also with his full power!

Boom!

A loud bang, and the next moment, the dao surged. A Death Hou shot out, but its death body was shattered into pieces by the old turtle's mountain suppression, its dao body fleeing!

The old turtle was also shocked!

*Damn!*

*It was really here?*

*This is too terrifying!*

The most impressive thing about the Celestial River of Death was its mystery, its unpredictability, and the uncertainty of whether there were powerful death spirits below. Unfortunately, at this moment, these powerful death spirits were all preparing to act, their daos connected.

Otherwise, if they were completely subdued and didn't disturb their daos, they wouldn't be in a state of readiness to strike, and wouldn't be able to launch an instant attack if they wanted to.

Despite his shock, the old turtle was a top-tier expert!

The Death Hou he had just severely wounded, under injury, remained locked onto his position. How could it be his opponent?

The turtle shell mountain suppressed downwards again!

Boom!

The fleeing Death Hou was crushed by his mountain!

The dao vibrated!

Never before had the old turtle felt killing a Death Hou was so simple.

In the distance, Su Yu continuously opened his Heaven Gate. Small Heaven Gates landed on the heads of the arriving garrisons, and also on the foreheads of the Great Qin King and the others.

“If you see a line, there must be a powerful expert. Kill them all without exception!”

“Understood!”

The Great Qin King and the others also instantly saw many lines. Without Su Yu needing to say more, they dispersed in all directions in the blink of an eye. The entire Celestial River of Death instantly erupted into a great battle!

Rumble!

Death Hou continuously flew out, filled with shock and confusion. *What's happening?*

In the blink of an eye, Su Yu and the old turtle had killed two Death Hou, and they hadn't even reacted.

On one hand, Su Yu was too bold, actually leading people directly into the Celestial River of Death. On the other hand, these people actually knew where they were.

…

North Heavenly King's Residence.

The North Heavenly King and his allies were also bewildered, utterly confused by Su Yu.

Su Yu hadn't come to attack the North Heavenly King's Residence, but had instead gone to attack the Celestial River of Death. They had previously thought that if they were defeated, they would flee to the Celestial River of Death.

But now…

The North Heavenly King was, after all, an enfeoffed Heavenly King. His expression changed slightly, as if he had realized something. *Heaven Gate, yes, Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate!*

He immediately roared, “He opened his Heaven Gate! Your hiding is useless! Do not expose your dao power…”

Boom!

The South Heavenly King attacked. Her face was stern, and she roared, “Since the Human Lord cannot come, then we will kill! Foolish fellows, if you don't expose your dao power, you'll die even faster. Do they dare not to?”

The North Heavenly King froze!

The next moment, he roared, and a large blade appeared. *Kill!*

“Kill her!”

The North Heavenly King roared, “There are countless experts in the Celestial River of Death. Su Yu and his allies cannot conquer the river, and with living beings entering, it will only awaken more Death Hou!”

Su Yu's method of suppressing the Celestial River of Death wouldn't work!

*Let's see how many you can kill!*

…

How many could he kill?

Su Yu didn't know. Who knew how many experts were truly in the Celestial River of Death, how many were slumbering, how many were waiting for an opportunity to revive?

At this moment, the Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Great Ming King, Heavendoom—four of them—the Book Spirit, the Tea Plant, plus the old turtle, had all entered!

Ten Daofuse experts!

Nine of them couldn't hide their living being aura; only the old turtle didn't need to hide.

This stimulated a large number of death spirits to begin reviving!

The lines continuously increased!

That meant powerful experts were connecting to the dao. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King also swept through all directions. The two didn't separate but joined forces, sweeping through everything. A Death Hou, who had been hiding perfectly, was directly smashed out by the Heaven and Earth Inkstone, instantly shattered into pieces!

With a thunderous boom, its dao body exploded, and a blade and a spear struck, instantly killing the opponent.

How strong could a newly revived death spirit be?

No matter how strong an ancient Daofuse expert was, if they had just revived, they would only be so-so!

At this moment, in the distance, an incredibly powerful being let out a low roar, “Everyone, gather here!”

*Damn it!*

This was the powerful being, Cang Shanming. He had just finished discussing with those Death Hou, and had finally persuaded everyone. They were just thinking of waiting for the battle to start and then attacking from behind, but who knew, this generation's Human Lord had directly charged in!

In the blink of an eye, four or five Death Hou, scattered throughout the river, had been eliminated!

Too fast!

So fast that Cang Shanming was somewhat disoriented, somewhat at a loss!

*Damn it, how could this happen?*

He had just reached an agreement with over a dozen Death Hou, but now four or five had been killed in an instant.

…

This time, Su Yu's sudden turn and attack on the Celestial River of Death truly caught everyone off guard.

Everyone had thought he would be on guard, but unexpectedly, he didn't guard against them; instead, he directly led his people in!

At this moment, several people followed behind Su Yu.

Su Yu casually threw out a death spirit mark and said in a low voice, “Hetu, eat it!”

Hetu had just gone to deliver the message and summon the old turtle. At this moment, he said no more. That was the death spirit mark Su Yu had just obtained from killing a Death Hou. *Eat!*

He was a death spirit; he didn't need to kill in the Luminous Domain Mansion like the garrisons.

Hetu swallowed those things, and his aura grew stronger.

And Su Yu's eyes moved. He struck out with his pen again towards the void, *Boom!*

Deep within the riverbed, a Death Hou spat out black blood. Without another word, and without showing its face, it instantly retracted all its dao power. Its aura rapidly weakened in the blink of an eye. Ignoring everything else, it hastily fled from the river!

Too terrifying!

And before Su Yu's eyes, the dao power it had connected to vanished.

That one could now at most unleash Sunmoon Realm power, or at most a little Eternal power, not daring to use dao power.

The Heaven Gate was the best weapon against these hidden experts!

Hide?

Where could they hide?

Unless you didn't use the power of laws!

Further away, the old turtle was clashing with Cang Shanming, actually fighting quite spiritedly. Another peerless expert, probably a Heavenly King-level one.

Su Yu didn't care; it wasn't strange to have Heavenly King-level experts.

He couldn't bother with so much now. Letting these fellows gather would be trouble. While they had just revived, and weren't too clear-headed, their true nature not yet stable, ignorant of fear and death, this was the best time to kill them!

The Mark of Civilization covered heaven and earth!

*Devour!*

Countless death spirits were directly devoured into his Mark of Civilization. In an instant, the entire river, which had previously floated countless death spirits, was empty before Su Yu!

On the Mark of Civilization, death qi also surged.

A large number of death spirits were killed by Su Yu!

He looked towards the North Heavenly King's Residence. Over there, the battle had also erupted.

The two sides were evenly matched, both with one Heavenly King and fourteen Death Hou. In a short time, it would be difficult to determine a winner.

It still depended on his side!

Su Yu was also incredibly annoyed. He had planned everything perfectly, but it had all been ruined by this bunch of trash. They had to revive for no good reason. And if reviving wasn't enough, they wanted to pick up scraps. *Dream on!*

If he didn't kill the North Heavenly King today, he would have to kill these fellows!

Rumble!

Battles were everywhere!

Ten Daofuse experts had arrived, plus twenty-seven garrisons, and Su Yu, along with nearly a hundred death monarchs. Such a powerful force, now killing its way into the river, also stirred up monstrous waves!

After the ancient conquests, no one had ever killed their way into the river!

In everyone's eyes, the river was mysterious, powerful, dangerous…

But Su Yu had come to kill!

He didn't follow everyone's routine, first besieging the North Heavenly King, then waiting for powerful experts to suddenly emerge from behind. He didn't do that; he directly charged in!

Not only that, the next moment, Su Yu roared, “Abandon the North Heavenly King's Domain! South Heavenly King, Lanshan, lead your forces to the river! I want to flatten this river!”

“…”

The South Heavenly King, who was fighting the North Heavenly King, paused. *What the hell?*

The North Heavenly King was also stunned.

He's not fighting me anymore?

He's going to fight the Celestial River of Death?

This… this… what should I do?

Should I go help?

Su Yu had gone mad, even mobilizing a large number of living being Daofuse experts. Now he didn't even care about his side, as if the experts of the Celestial River of Death were even more detestable.

What to do?

The South Heavenly King frowned, just about to say something, when Lanshan Hou struck back a Hou and roared, “To the Celestial River of Death!”

“Stop them!”

The North Heavenly King roared. Now it was he who had to entangle the South Heavenly King and her allies. He couldn't let them leave. If they truly flattened the Celestial River of Death, then his side would have no way out either.

But in doing so, his subordinate Death Hou were somewhat unwilling.

To be honest, Su Yu, that killing machine, had directly charged into the Celestial River of Death and summoned a large number of living being experts. They were somewhat worried.

That White Dog hadn't even arrived yet!

How many experts were waiting in the Human Realm?

Also, Su Yu was too ferocious!

Even death spirits didn't dare to rashly enter the river, but Su Yu, good for him, had charged in
