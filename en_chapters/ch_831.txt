Chapter 831: The Cycle of Heaven's Retribution

(Sleepless night, feeling exhausted and listless)

Su Yu deeply felt that his strength was still insufficient!

Even though his progress was rapid and his subordinates were formidable, he still felt it wasn't enough. The root of this feeling lay in the trap set by the Human Emperor. Otherwise, Su Yu might have already led his people upstream.

The reason he hadn't gone was due to his concerns. Currently, in the Myriad Realms, the only known opportunity for him to advance lay behind the Gate of Hell, which was even more perilous than the Human Emperor's domain. Simply relying on small gains wouldn't elevate him to the highest level. If it were that simple, it would have been easy!

...

Death Realm.

Su Yu arrived once more.

The Undead Emperor quickly sensed his presence. Seeing Su Yu, he hurriedly greeted, "Your Majesty!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, casting a glance at Chen, an ancient being from the era of the Lord of the Undead. After some thought, Su Yu asked, "Undead King, I have a question for you."

"Please, Your Majesty!"

"In your era, how did the powerful cultivate to such formidable levels?"

"Was it purely through the accumulation of time?"

Su Yu pondered, "Was it simply relying on time to build a foundation?"

This question stumped the Undead Emperor. For a moment, he didn't know how to respond. The powerful beings Su Yu referred to were clearly not ordinary; even the rulers of laws might not impress him. Su Yu was interested in those terrifying existences.

After a moment of hesitation, the Undead Emperor replied, "Your Majesty, the strength of the powerful in the Myriad Realms ultimately traces back to the River of Time! In our era, before the portals appeared, the foundation of everything was the River of Time! Whether it was the Lord of the Undead or others, their strength fundamentally depended on the River of Time!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. Indeed, the River of Time was the most mysterious, powerful, and terrifying existence in the Myriad Realms. His understanding of it was limited; for instance, he hadn't ventured upstream or deeply downstream, fearing potential issues.

Going upstream might mean that a day there equates to a long time here. Conversely, going downstream might thrust one directly into the future. The River of Time doesn't exist in this segment of the Myriad Realms; reaching other places could lead to unforeseen problems. Upstream exists in the past, downstream in the future.

Connecting past and future selves... this is the concept of the Three Body Method. It involves drawing from the River of Time to strengthen oneself by capturing past and future aspects.

The Undead Emperor's answer was precisely this: the strength of beings like the Lord of the Undead was rooted in the River of Time.

"Past and future selves..."

Su Yu murmured, contemplating the abandoned Three Body Method! It was considered the weakest method of proving one's path, but it allowed one to die three times. Moreover, if truly powerful, one could capture the future and the past, continuously layering oneself.

Of course, under normal circumstances, ordinary people couldn't achieve this. Su Yu hadn't studied the Three Body Method because it was widely regarded as weak.

At this moment, Su Yu thought about the Heaven Gate, the Earth Gate, and going upstream... but the Undead Emperor said that the foundation of everything was still the River of Time, and everyone's strength was derived from it.

Su Yu stroked his chin, pondering some questions, and suddenly asked, "Do you know about the Three Body Method?"

"The Three Body Method?"

The Undead Emperor had heard of it, but by the time he was unsealed, Su Yu's side had already abandoned the Three Body Method. Even those who had previously walked the path of the Three Bodies had mostly switched methods.

Su Yu continued, "When I was weaker, I entered the River of Time with others, but the river I saw then was different from the one I see now!"

Su Yu explained, "Back then, I could see some past memories and even glimpse the future! Of course, I never looked into the future! According to everyone's explanation, that was because we were on a tributary... able to see some memory traces. But now, when I look at the River of Time, why is it different from before? I only see the mainstream, without those bubbles from before!"

Su Yu hadn't paid much attention to this issue because, back then, what he saw might have been just some scenes recorded in his memory, imprinted in the river. Now that he was stronger, those imprints were no longer compatible with the river, which was quite normal.

"Memories?"

The Undead Emperor was somewhat surprised. "Your Majesty means that the Three Body Method you mentioned can view memories through the River of Time?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu nodded, "I even saw others' memories, but now, because we no longer follow the Three Body Method, I lead people directly through the mainstream of the River of Time, so it seems no one can see them anymore."

"The Three Body Method... Your Majesty, could you explain it in detail?"

The Three Body Method was a widely used technique that emerged after the ancient times disappeared. The Undead Emperor had little understanding of it.

Su Yu quickly explained, "In my view, the past and future selves of the Three Body Method are essentially the power of laws, insights into the past, and explorations of the future. Thus, when the three bodies merge, one becomes incredibly powerful!"

The Undead Emperor grew interested, "The Three Body Method... Your Majesty, I am certain that in our era, this method did not exist! Who created this Three Body Method?"

"This..."

Su Yu truly didn't know! He only knew that in ancient times, this method existed, but few used it because it was too weak. The existence of the Three Body Method was weaker than other methods of proving one's path. In terms of survival... a strong person killing you once or three times made no difference.

However, the Undead Emperor remarked, "Your Majesty, three times... you can actually resurrect twice! You mentioned being killed involves the shattering of the sea of will, the breaking of the path, and the destruction of the physical body. In such cases, one can still resurrect?"

Su Yu was taken aback!

Indeed, one could resurrect!

The Three Body Method allowed for this.

The Undead Emperor inhaled sharply, "Your Majesty, even as a creator of worlds, the matter of resurrection is something you cannot achieve in your world, correct?"

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then nodded, "It's very difficult, perhaps because I'm too weak now. I cannot achieve resurrection; otherwise, the powerful in my world would be immortal!"

"Exactly!"

"But according to Your Majesty, as long as one reaches the peak of the Sunmoon Realm, the so-called quasi-invincible realm, with past and future selves, one can actually resurrect... this defies common sense!"

The Undead Emperor was extremely surprised, "Yet you claim this method is the weakest..."

Su Yu couldn't help but say, "It's not just me; everyone says so, and... it's true. The Three Body Method has many drawbacks. When the three bodies are separate, it's very weak, and even when combined, it's not as strong as normal cultivation!"

At this point, Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "The separation of the three bodies, striking the path, forcing the opponent's three bodies to separate... why does the Three Body Method feel somewhat like the path of avatars, imprinting three times on the path, dividing the whole person into three parts... so after dying once, one can resurrect again..."

The Three Body Method, as Su Yu now saw it, was indeed a method of resurrection, something extremely difficult.

Who created the Three Body Method?

It seemed quite complex!

However, the Undead Emperor thought for a moment and said, "Your Majesty, is there any representative figure for the Three Body Method?"

"No!"

Su Yu shook his head, "In ancient times, the Three Body Method wasn't practiced. After ancient times, few cultivated it, and those who did either died or changed paths! Currently, those practicing the Three Body Method..."

Are there any left?

Su Yu thought for a moment, "There should still be some Eternals, the Eternals of the myriad races who haven't changed paths, likely still practicing the Three Body Method!"

The Undead Emperor was silent for a while before speaking, "This Three Body Method reminds me of something!"

"What?"

"The Lord of the Undead!"

What does this have to do with the Lord of the Undead?

Su Yu was surprised. Was it a technique he created?

The Undead Emperor explained, "At the end of the era of the opening of the heavens, the Lord of the Undead had a thought, a very shocking thought, which he later abandoned..."

"What was it?"

"To devour the River of Time!"

Su Yu grimaced. Indeed, it was domineering and insane, something he hadn't even considered!

The Undead Emperor recalled for a moment and continued, "At that time, the Lord of the Undead was very domineering. He once mentioned in the Myriad Realms that he wanted to find three powerful beings to support the entire River of Time from the front, middle, and back, compress it, and swallow it!"

"However, according to some statements at the time, the River of Time exists in different dimensions... which is what Your Majesty refers to as the past, present, and future!"

"So, one person cannot exist simultaneously in three temporal dimensions... could it be... that the Three Body Method is related to the Lord of the Undead's idea?"

He was filled with doubt, while Su Yu furrowed his brow, "You mean, the Lord of the Undead said that when a person is at one end of the River of Time, they cannot appear at the other end?"

"Yes!"

The Lord of the Undead nodded, "Not even avatars! For example, if Your Majesty goes upstream now, even if you leave an avatar here, once you leave the Myriad Realms' range, the avatar will collapse!"

Su Yu furrowed his brow, "What about the separation of spirit and flesh?"

"This... I'm not sure, maybe it's possible?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "So, it's impossible to have avatars simultaneously at the source of the River of Time, at the end, and here?"

"Yes, that's what the Lord of the Undead meant. Specifically, I'm not too sure, as it involves very advanced concepts!"

"......"

Su Yu nodded, falling into deep thought.

He had come to resurrect the Undead Emperor, but as they talked, the topic shifted to the Three Body Method.

And at this moment, the Three Body Method suddenly seemed a bit mysterious.

Revival from death is a problem that many cannot solve, including the Human Emperor and the Culture King. No one can do it! Yet, the Three Body Method, a seemingly worthless technique, allows its practitioners to live three times. This means that even if their physical body, willpower sea, and Dao are all destroyed, they can still revive. It's terrifying!

Especially since this isn't an exception; it's the norm for all who practice it. Ever since Su Yu deemed the Three Body Method too weak, he hadn't paid much attention to it. Three times? Even if you revive three hundred times, if someone can kill you, they'll still kill you!

However, having personally overseen a revival, Su Yu knew how difficult it was. Reviving a spirit in the Death Realm could anger the Undead Emperor. Thoughts swirled in his mind, but Su Yu quickly suppressed them and said in a deep voice, "Let's not study this for now. I'm here to help you revive! Once you're revived, I'll capture some practitioners of the Three Body Method from the Myriad Realms and let you examine them."

Others, being in the midst of it, had grown accustomed to dismissing the Three Body Method as trash. But the Undead Emperor, who hadn't encountered it before, might discover something new.

"Revival..." At this moment, the Undead Emperor was bewildered. Am I... going to be revived?

"Your Majesty, but what about the Lord of the Undead..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Last time he tried to stop me, he barely reached the level of a fifth-tier ruler of laws. So, this time, when you revive, what level do you think he can reach?"

Even if the opponent awakens again, Su Yu believed his own growth was faster. As long as I grow quickly, even if I keep reviving, you can't do anything to me. The first time, you were fifth-tier; this time, you might be fourth or even third-tier, and I'll still defeat you!

The Undead Emperor's heart stirred. Yes, Su Yu's growth was too rapid! If that's the case... he was also a bit excited. Revival is a good thing! Everyone desires it!

However, Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "If you revive, you can only revive in my world, and my world... to be honest, can't support another revival right now!"

The Undead Emperor didn't quite understand what Su Yu meant. Su Yu smiled and explained, "Simply put, my world and the Death Path have no intersection, so it can't guide those who fall in my world! So, the talk of revival was just to boost morale. Currently, the life and death path in my world isn't strong enough to guide the dead... so, if you die here, it's true death!"

There's no chance of becoming a spirit. Last time, the South Heavenly King scared the Myriad Realms' experts because he didn't understand the process of the Death Path's guidance.

The Undead Emperor laughed, "That doesn't concern us much. Even if the Celestial River of Death could guide, it would be difficult to guide rulers of laws. Otherwise, those deceased rulers would have revived long ago!"

"Weren't you a ruler of laws when you were alive?"

Su Yu was still puzzled by this. Indeed, the Death Realm shouldn't be able to guide rulers of laws. Was the Undead Emperor not a ruler of laws when alive?

The Undead Emperor was silent for a moment before speaking, "I suppose I was."

"Suppose?"

"I... was Eternal! Does Your Majesty understand?"

"A path opener!"

Su Yu understood, "So, you had the strength of a ruler of laws before your path was fully opened, right?"

"Yes!"

The Undead Emperor nodded, "I was similar to Fat Ball and others, a path opener. But for a path opener to fully open their path... there's a transformation period where the path no longer extends, and only then is it fully opened, becoming a tributary of the River of Time. I hadn't reached that stage, so I was just Eternal, but my path was strong enough not to fear ordinary rulers of laws."

"What path did you open?"

Su Yu was intrigued. In that era, opening paths wasn't rare. Initially, there weren't many paths in the world; it was the predecessors who opened paths for later generations to merge into.

So, what path did the Undead Emperor open back then? To have the strength of a ruler of laws before fully opening it was impressive; the path wasn't weak!

"The Path of Stars!"

The Undead Emperor explained, "Your Majesty has seen it too; the heavens have the sun and moon..."

Su Yu nodded, suddenly startled. Yes, the heavens have the sun and moon; it's normal. There's even a Sunmoon Realm named after it. What's the matter?

But the sun and moon... everyone is used to their existence and doesn't pay much attention. What exactly are the sun and moon?

Su Yu suddenly found himself distracted. Why am I thinking about so much today? The sun and moon are common things; everyone knows the heavens have them. The sun is yang, the moon is yin. What's the issue?

The Undead Emperor didn't mind and continued, "The Path of Stars, or rather, the Path of Sun and Moon! Absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, summoning their power, perhaps it's the power of yin and yang. But my path mainly focuses on the Path of the Moon..."

Overall, Su Yu understood and said solemnly, "You mean your path is based on the sun and moon, similar to the Moon Heavenly Venerable?"

"Something like that!"

Su Yu understood, "This path, you opened it yourself. What are its characteristics?"

He explained, "Just curious."

"Characteristics?"

The Undead Emperor didn't mind and continued, "It's extremely cold, freezing the soul, but it has the effect of tempering the body. That's about it."

Su Yu nodded. The Path of Sun and Moon! Interesting. Where exactly are the sun and moon? He could see them, but didn't know where they were. If you fly high enough, you'll reach the Upper Realm, and beyond that, you'll enter chaos!

Thoughts emerged one after another. Soon, Su Yu said, "I don't seem to have recorded the Path of Stars, but I do have the Path of Yin and Yang. You can choose the Path of Yin and Yang! The difference isn't significant! Or, you can consider opening a new path in my world later!"

The Undead Emperor smiled, "It doesn't matter; they're similar. Besides, the Path of Yin and Yang is a great path, with even more potential than the Path of Stars!"

Su Yu nodded again and called out, "Liu Hong!"

Moments later, the world trembled. Liu Hong appeared in a flash, glanced at the Undead Emperor, then at Su Yu, and gasped, "Your Majesty... are you going to revive the Undead King?"

"Yes!"

My heavens, this is going to be the death of me!

Su Yu looked at Liu Hong, silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "Don't think you can hide; I might need you!"

"What?" Liu Hong was slightly stunned. What do you mean? Not making me a shadow guard?

Su Yu was silent for a moment, "If I want to go upstream, I can't move my world with me. Even if I could, it would be too late! Your Ink Dao, didn't I help you move it to the intersection of life and death before?"

Liu Hong's heart stirred. Yes, what's up?

"You... try to connect one end of the Ink Dao to my world! Connect the River of Time, the Celestial River of Death, and my world, all three paths together!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "This way, the power of my world might radiate further, maybe even upstream!"

Liu Hong gasped, "Your Majesty, isn't Lantian doing this?"

Lantian seems to be in charge of connecting, so why are you asking me?

This is too dangerous!

Su Yu shook his head, "First, I had Lantian sever his path and integrate into my world. Now, even if he returns to the River of Time, it's troublesome, though not too difficult! Second, Lantian mainly focuses on the Time Path, not the Death Path. I want to connect the Death Path too!"

Liu Hong was puzzled. Does it matter?

Su Yu said irritably, "Are you stupid? Without connecting the Death Path, how can people revive? How can the Celestial River of Death guide? How can we steal its power?"

Su Yu said solemnly, "My world is currently unbalanced in life and death! Xingyue controls the Life Path. Even if I balance life and death, she keeps drawing power from the Life Path to strengthen herself, causing my life and death to be unbalanced. Now, I need the power of the Death Path to perfect my life and death balance!"

He couldn't stop it. Xingyue naturally controlled the Life Path, and Su Yu couldn't ask her not to cultivate. But this disrupted the balance of life and death in Su Yu's world.

Liu Hong grimaced, "Your Majesty, then I... won't I really become a conduit?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu nodded, "Don't you like it? Not only are you a conduit, but you're also a three-way connector!"

"......"

Liu Hong was on the verge of tears. The way you put it, a three-way connector... indeed, his path was at the intersection of life and death. Su Yu's meaning was clear: one part draws power from the River of Time, another from the Celestial River of Death, and another connects to Su Yu's world.

Su Yu also smiled, "This way... there's hope for achieving a life and death balance. Xingyue controlling the Life and Death Path should become three times stronger, and as she grows stronger, the Life and Death Path in my world strengthens, indirectly enhancing myself!"

Great! This idea was initially meant for Lantian, but now Su Yu realized Liu Hong might be more suitable. This guy had previously asked Su Yu to move his path to the intersection of life and death, wanting to benefit from both sides. Su Yu thought, why not benefit from both and satisfy myself too!

Great!

And Liu Hong, looking helpless, realized he still had to work for Su Yu.

Su Yu didn't care whether he agreed or not and continued, "Later, just like last time, guide the Undead King into my world!"

Su Yu waved his hand, and in the distance, a projection of the Land of the Abyss appeared. He spoke, "Just like last time, the Undead Emperor will enter, absorb the power of origin, and through the Ink Dao, channel the power of life and death, connecting with the power of the Great Dao in my world. I'll infuse you with enough life force to aid your revival!"

The Undead Emperor took a deep breath, surprised by the suddenness of it all. He thought Su Yu wouldn't consider revival again so soon. Yet, here Su Yu was, initiating a second revival without hesitation.

Without a moment's delay, Su Yu shouted, punching the sky. A river appeared above, and he instantly tore a hole in it, stepping inside. As soon as he entered, the river began to churn violently. His previous visit had left a strong impression, and now the entire Celestial River of Death trembled as if to say, "That troublemaker is back!"

It was akin to someone stripping the South Heavenly King from Su Yu's world, stealing his Great Dao power, and fleeing. Naturally, Su Yu would have to fight back if that happened. Clearly, this was how he intended to deal with the Lord of the Undead.

"Scoundrel!" A thunderous voice echoed throughout the river, exerting immense pressure even on Su Yu. The river surged with massive waves.

This revival was much quicker than the last, almost instantaneous. A giant undead figure emerged, initially confused, but soon its eyes gleamed with clarity. It looked at Su Yu coldly, "You've returned?"

Su Yu smiled, "Are you the Lord of the Undead or the Master of the Dead?"

The undead giant, wielding a massive trident, approached Su Yu with indifference. "Undead or dead, they are one and the same. Why have you come this time?"

"To revive someone."

"Who?"

"That Undead Emperor..."

"Hmph!" A cold snort reverberated through the river. The undead giant was furious, "You intend to extract the first ruler of the river?"

What a joke! It was like extracting the strongest entity from Su Yu's world. Reviving a minor figure might not have mattered, but reviving the Undead Emperor was unacceptable!

In an instant, the giant trident thrust toward Su Yu. Su Yu caught it with one hand, looking down with a smile, "Hurry up. This revival is too fast. Go absorb your origin power quickly, and we'll leave without disturbing the Master of the Dead!"

Below, the Undead Emperor swiftly soared through the air, while the undead giant roared, thrusting the trident again, only for Su Yu to catch it once more.

The undead giant was shaken, "How many years have passed?"

Could countless years have passed since the last time? The last time he saw Su Yu, he was merely a Heavenly Venerable, close to a ruler of laws but not quite there. Yet now, upon revival, he had the strength of a fifth-tier ruler of laws!

Last time, Su Yu had relied on the Marquis of Dragon Blood to disperse him. This time, Su Yu directly caught his trident!

Su Yu laughed, "Friend, there's no need for violence. If you want to revive to the third or fourth tier, it takes time. My presence benefits you. If you drive me away, you'll have to continue slumbering."

"But with me here, you can continuously strengthen yourself, vying for control with the Master of the Dead..."

Su Yu chuckled, "This is like working for the public while fattening yourself! If you drive me away now, the will of the Master of the Dead won't provide you with power indefinitely. That's not good. See, you're already stronger, aren't you?"

The Undead Emperor quickly flew deeper, ignoring the waves that had little effect on a fourth-tier ruler of laws like him. The core power lay with the undead giant, now blocked by Su Yu.

Soon, a loud boom echoed from the depths! The entire river shook violently! As the strongest and the first to be summoned, the Undead Emperor was merging with his origin, causing the river to resist.

The Master of the Dead's gaze turned icy, and his aura rapidly ascended to the fourth tier, continuing to rise! Sensing a powerful entity attempting to break free from his Great Dao, the undead giant grew stronger.

"Bold junior! You dare to seize my nurtured undead, courting death!" The Master of the Dead's voice boomed, and the trident in his hand transformed into a book in an instant!

Yes, a book! Completely different from before! The undead giant's aura surged again, opening the book and wielding a pen. With a stroke, he marked a drop of undead ink, which instantly transformed into Su Yu's likeness.

With another stroke, he drew an eye on Su Yu's image. Boom! Su Yu's eyes suddenly burned with pain, as if scorched by death energy!

The undead giant spoke coldly, "Junior, as fellow creators of the heavens, I refrain from bullying the weak, but you've gone too far. Daring to occupy my domain, even a wisp of will is beyond your capability! Today, I shall kill you!"

With another stroke, Su Yu's other eye appeared, and his eyes turned into undead eyes, causing him immense pain, as if he were going blind!

"This is my domain. To challenge me here is... courting death!" The undead giant continued, drawing Su Yu's nose, which was immediately corroded by death energy, the power of the Death Path!

"You are the Master of the Undead!" Su Yu shouted, realizing this was the true will of the Master of the Undead, just newly projected.

Su Yu roared, gathering the power of myriad Daos, and a book appeared, along with a pen. "You're not the true body. Can you really defeat me?"

"You want to draw? I can play this game too!" Su Yu wrote a character in the Mark of Civilization, "Seal!"

A massive seal flew toward the opponent. "Life!" Countless life forces surged toward the opponent, while death energy swept over. Both wielded books, their Dao powers clashing midway. Su Yu was stronger, but the opponent had the advantage of being in his own domain!

They were evenly matched, with Su Yu slightly ahead. The undead giant's expression changed, and he snorted, drawing Su Yu's hands. Su Yu's hands turned black, but he didn't care, gritting his teeth and drawing a gate!

The gate appeared in his book and on his forehead, merging instantly. The power of myriad Daos converged, covering the opponent in an instant!

"Heaven Gate?" The undead giant's eyes flickered with anger, "A Heaven Gate projection? Pathetic... I fear not even the true Heaven Gate, let alone a mere projection..."

"You're just a projection too!" Su Yu retorted, "Do you think you're the true body?"

The undead giant hesitated, realizing he wasn't the true body. But it was too late. As he attacked, a powerful pressure erupted from the Heaven Gate projection, transforming into chains that enveloped him!

"Impudent!" The Master of the Dead roared, "Even the true Master of Time can't bind me, let alone a mere sealing chain! Break!"

With a low shout, the undead book in his hand shattered, striking the Heaven Gate projection, causing it to tremble and show signs of breaking!

Su Yu quickly noted these words, his eyes flickering. He sneered, "If the projection can't handle you, I'll go to the upper reaches of the River of Time to find the true Heaven Gate to deal with you..."

The undead giant sneered, "Can you even reach it? Arrogant!"

With that, his death energy surged again, causing the river to tremble violently, striking the Heaven Gate projection once more!

Meanwhile, in the distance, the Undead Emperor roared, his aura growing immensely powerful. In the blink of an eye, he entered Liu Hong's Ink Dao, heading toward Su Yu's world. With his previous experience, he knew how to revive.

The Lord of the Undead's expression shifted slightly as he spoke in a deep voice, "Chen, I once gave you a chance to live, and now even you betray me!"

In the distance, the Undead Emperor's eyes flickered, "I... just wanted to live once more..."

"Hmph!"

A cold snort echoed, and the Lord of the Undead's face turned icy. He glanced at Su Yu and sneered, "The Heaven Gate is too chaotic. I can't project too much power; otherwise... killing you would be as easy as slaughtering a chicken! This time, I'll let you have a small advantage. You'd better not come to the Heaven Gate, or... if it opens, you're dead!"

Su Yu chuckled, "We'll see when the time comes. Why resort to violence..."

Boom!

A massive force radiated through the River of Time, and in an instant, the undead giant vanished. His final words echoed, "If you have the guts, come find me at the Heaven Gate! You're quite something. Are those two your accomplices? Fine, I didn't want to meddle... but since they're with you, I'll collect the interest and go after them!"

"......"

Su Yu was taken aback. The next moment, his expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly shouted, "No, I'm not familiar with them!"

"......"

The voice disappeared, and the river calmed, leaving the world in silence.

The Undead Emperor was in the process of resurrection, but Su Yu couldn't be bothered with that now.

At this moment, Su Yu opened his mouth, hesitated for a while, and then awkwardly said, "Is... is it over?"

The Culture King and the Martial King had set up the Human Emperor, and the Human Emperor had set up Su Yu. Now... it seemed Su Yu had inadvertently set up those two.

Is this the cycle of karma, where the heavens spare no one?

I... really didn't expect this to happen!

"Uh... sorry, I didn't expect him to say that..."

Su Yu was at a loss for words. Does this mean he doesn't need to rescue the Culture King and the Martial King anymore?

They might be doomed!

...

At the same time.

Beyond the Heaven Gate, in the endless void, the Culture King and the Martial King were still hiding. Suddenly, a surge of overwhelming death energy erupted in a certain area, accompanied by a terrifying force!

A chilling voice echoed, "Culture King, Martial King? Well done! I knew that person looked familiar. So, you're in cahoots, seizing my domain and occupying my path. Are you ready?"

Boom!

An overwhelming aura surged into the sky!

...

The Martial King glanced at the Culture King, blinking, "Is he talking about us?"

What's going on?

I don't quite understand!

Is this... a sign that we're in trouble?

The Culture King's expression changed, his mouth twitching. After a long pause, he whispered, almost inaudibly, "We're doomed! That kid... got us into trouble, and it seems... we're taking the fall for it!"

The Martial King froze. That Su Yu?

Doomed!

This one is not to be trifled with, not even Old Wen can handle him!

The Martial King inhaled sharply, "Your son got us into trouble?"

Terrifying!

"I told you, he's just like you. See, even the Lord of the Undead says so. Indeed, he knows it's your son... Old Wen, you're too much, and your son is even worse!"

"......"

Damn you!

At this moment, the Culture King felt like spitting blood.

Who did I provoke?

This has nothing to do with me!

So, even after entering the Heaven Gate, I still have to take the blame?

And in the distance, that overwhelming aura erupted again, carrying a cold indifference, "I will find you. Is that person your disciple or your descendant? White robe... deliberately targeting me? Indeed, harboring hostility towards me for a long time, deserving death!"

He passed on the black robe!

Now, the Culture King's face turned green. So, wearing a white robe has something to do with him?

What kind of logic is this?

The Martial King quickly transmitted his voice, "Old Wen, I told you, don't wear a white robe, but you insisted. Now we're doomed. If this one really comes looking for trouble, we can't handle it!"

If it were just this one, it wouldn't be too bad. Even if we can't win, it's not a big deal. The key is, this one jumped out halfway, not our long-standing enemy!

The Culture King's eyes flickered. The next moment, a hearty laugh echoed through the heavens, "Thank you, fellow Daoist, for helping me out. Fellow Daoist, leave quickly, be careful of being besieged... retreat!"

With those words, the Culture King grabbed the Martial King and fled!

If you insist on jumping out, don't blame me for dragging you down with me!
