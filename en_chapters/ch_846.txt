Chapter 846: Massacre! (Please Subscribe)

The Culture King and Martial King have emerged!

At this moment, the myriad races were filled with dread. Even though the Martial King seemed to be only at the second tier and appeared heavily injured, who would dare underestimate the two kings of culture and martial arts? Despite the passage of many years, they still instilled fear in everyone!

With the Human Emperor present, there was fear, but he alone could not uphold the heavens and could only maintain the status quo. The Culture King, however, was even more unrestrained than the Human Emperor.

At this moment, Su Yu walked with small steps, a faint smile on his face, and chuckled, "What’s wrong? Weren’t you all clamoring to destroy the human race earlier?"

"Why... have you suddenly stopped?"

Su Yu's voice was ethereal, carrying a casual tone as if he were chatting about everyday matters. Yet, opposite him, the Nether Emperor and his companions were all extremely solemn.

In the center was the Human Emperor's physical body. However, at this moment, even the Human Emperor's body seemed to have come to a halt.

"Just kill them already. Do you want to chat with them again?" The Martial Emperor's voice rang out, as reckless as ever. His impersonation of the Martial King was seamless!

"A brute is just a brute!"

Su Yu laughed, and suddenly, a pen appeared in his hand. He looked at the Nether Emperor and chuckled, "How about a game? Your strength has improved quite a bit since back then. If I strike you with my pen and you survive, I won’t kill you today. How about that?"

The Nether Emperor's expression was grave. The next moment, he coldly said, "Culture King, no matter how strong you are, you are still just one person..."

He glanced at the powerful figures beside him, feeling more confident.

Su Yu chuckled, "You've reached the first tier, yet you’re unwilling to take a single strike from me? It would be a good way to see if I’ve made any progress over the years and how badly I was injured in the Heaven Gate."

Su Yu's smile was radiant, "Why not give it a try? If you don’t dare to face me alone... you can all join forces to take this strike. If you succeed, I’ll let it go today!"

The Nether Emperor's face was heavy. When the Culture King and Martial King appeared, he was indeed a bit frightened and reluctant to continue fighting. Even if a victor emerged, many would die!

Now, the Culture King said he would let it go today, but the Nether Emperor didn’t believe him. He was only pondering how strong the Culture King had become after entering the Heaven Gate for so many years. Was he injured?

He vaguely felt that the Culture King was injured, his aura unstable, and the Martial King seemed the same. Perhaps both were heavily wounded.

On his side, including those who had arrived earlier, there were over 30 powerful figures!

If the Culture King and Martial King could kill 30 strong individuals, then indeed, there was no way to fight.

The Nether Emperor's expression was icy as he coldly said, "Culture King, how much strength do you have left? Are you just bluffing?"

Su Yu laughed, "Why not try? If I’m bluffing, wouldn’t that give you the perfect opportunity?"

Su Yu's smile was bright, and the next moment, a giant pen appeared in his hand. At this moment, the power of the surrounding world converged, and the Nether Emperor and his companions vaguely sensed something amiss, but they were all focused on the Culture King and Martial King.

The rulers of laws behind him were sweating. The Culture King... some of the rulers of laws were latecomers, ancient marquises. In their era, the Culture King had dominated the world. He was very strong and quite ruthless. When he went to the Immortal Realm, he broke three great paths in succession, forcing the Immortal Race to submit.

He did the same in other realms.

When the Culture King visited the Fate Realm, the Fate Clan chose to submit, not daring to defy him.

In the myriad realms, the Human Emperor was responsible for holding the center, but most of the strong races were subdued by the Culture King. Compared to the Human Emperor, they feared the Culture King more.

...

At this moment, the power of laws overflowed from Su Yu's pen. He lifted the pen and smiled, "Just one move, let me see if you’ve made any progress over the years. If you haven’t, then rebelling might be a bit foolish."

Should they take it?

Should they test it?

Or should they just retreat?

Retreating now would be even more dangerous. Once they retreated, if the Culture King and Martial King attacked, and the Human Emperor's spirit and flesh united...

Countless thoughts swirled in his mind. The Nether Emperor's face was grave, and in an instant, he made a decision, quickly transmitting to those behind him, "Test him. He must have been injured in the Heaven Gate and paid a great price to come out! He’s trying to intimidate us, otherwise, with the Martial King's personality, he would have attacked already!"

The Culture King is intimidating them!

Yes, at this moment, he made a judgment. The next moment, the Nether Emperor coldly said, "Then I really want to learn from the Culture King! Culture King, the era has changed. This era no longer belongs to you!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "What boldness! Very well, then let’s play!"

The next moment, the power of the great path overflowed, and Su Yu's aura continued to rise!

Second tier, second tier peak... in an instant, he even vaguely reached the first tier!

Before the Great Zhou King merged with the Dao, Su Yu had vaguely reached the second tier peak within his own world. After the Great Zhou King merged with the Dao, Su Yu's world power became stronger, and without borrowing Gui's power, he was almost at the first tier.

Once he borrowed Gui's power, Su Yu would be even stronger than now.

As his momentum rose, no one doubted him anymore.

Or rather, few doubted him from the start. Now, feeling his aura continuously rising, reaching the first tier in the blink of an eye, no one doubted him at all.

Besides the Culture King, who else could reach the first tier?

In the myriad realms, such a person no longer existed.

The Nether Emperor's face was extremely grave!

In the distance, the human experts were extremely excited, and the Human Emperor's eyes flickered. The next moment, he shouted, "Kill!"

They had to take advantage of this moment to disrupt the others.

A group of human experts, extremely excited and agitated, roared, "Kill!"

Our top experts have returned!

This battle will surely be victorious!

Boom!

The battle erupted once more.

Feeling the commotion behind them, the Nether Emperor and his companions dared not look back. Instead, they all wore extremely grave expressions, looking at Su Yu.

Beside him, the Martial Emperor coldly laughed, "A bunch of trash, just kill them all!"

"Heh!"

Su Yu chuckled, lifting the giant pen and pointing it at the Nether Emperor, softly saying, "I’m about to strike. If you block it, you’ll have a chance to live. Otherwise... no matter how many you are, you won’t be able to save your life!"

At this moment, the winds surged, and the long river trembled!

The momentum was immense!

The entire river seemed to be trembling!

Everyone grew more solemn. How strong was this strike?

"Some time ago, with this pen, I killed a 20-path expert. I hope... you can survive!"

Su Yu's voice came ethereally.

The hearts of the Nether Emperor and his companions instantly grew extremely heavy!

A 20-path expert?

At this moment, even the Nether Emperor had just reached the first tier, and he certainly didn’t have 20 paths!

"Bluffing!"

The Nether Emperor roared, "Who are you trying to scare? Come on!"

Are you trying to scare us?

"As you wish!"

The giant pen, carrying immense power, swept forward!

The Nether Emperor and his companions were extremely solemn, their auras erupting as they prepared to counterattack with all their might!

But... the Nether Emperor felt it and frowned slightly.

Was the divine charm restrained?

This strike was strong!

But... it seemed to be just about as strong as himself.

But he didn’t dare to be careless!

Underestimating the Culture King would lead to death.

Even if the other had disappeared for a long time, while they were growing stronger, hadn’t he grown stronger too?

"Form a formation!"

The Nether Emperor transmitted in a low voice, "Power rules, join forces to resist! If his attack isn’t strong enough... immediately counterattack and kill him and the Martial King!"

"Alright!"

The others responded.

Let’s test the Culture King’s strength first!

"One stroke to determine the universe!"

At this moment, Su Yu remained ethereal and graceful. In the void, a giant arrow shot towards them, the river water violently fluctuating!

Huge waves surged!

For experts of their level, such waves were normal when they struck.

The Nether Emperor also roared, "Fight!"

A group of people, their auras soaring!

We don’t believe you can kill 30 experts with one strike. If you could, you would have been invincible long ago!

And just as their auras soared, the river violently shook. Marquis Tongtian, hidden in the water, was also shocked. Damn, they’re all turning their backs on me, not caring about us at all?

This... truly impressive!

Emperor Yu is amazing!

Mainly, he’s too bold. At this moment, if the Nether Emperor and his companions weren’t afraid and charged forward, 30 rulers of laws, including first-tier existences, could definitely kill Su Yu and the Martial King!

But they didn’t dare.

They still wanted to test it!

At this moment, they were all fully focused, prepared to face Su Yu’s attack.

The river’s violent fluctuations also concealed Marquis Tongtian’s small movements.

Behind, the strong were all engaged in battle, and no one had time to care about this side.

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian’s portal vaguely opened, revealing figures in the water, all fully focused, quickly assigning tasks. They couldn’t attack chaotically; they had to seize a few individuals and strive for a one-hit kill!

And at this moment, Su Yu struck with his pen, and the next moment, shouted, "Taishan, let’s kill together!"

The Martial Emperor’s aura instantly erupted!

The Nether Emperor’s eyes widened in rage, roaring, "You... shameless..."

They were going to join forces, despite agreeing to a one-on-one!

A group of people, all going all out, their power erupting, attacking Su Yu and the Martial King. They were going to join forces to kill us!

Boom!

Immense power surged out, and Su Yu and the Martial King... instantly retreated.

The Nether Emperor and his companions, prepared for a bloody battle, were stunned.

They fled?

They fled!

What a joke!

Why?

Were they too heavily injured?

In an instant, countless thoughts emerged. At this moment, the Nether Emperor and his companions had unleashed a powerful strike, entering a power gap. As the Nether Emperor was slightly stunned, he seemed to sense something, his expression changing drastically, roaring, "Underwater..."

Before he could finish, boom!

A thunderous sound echoed through the river, shaking the heavens and earth!

At this moment, over 30 experts struck simultaneously, all underwater, unleashing a full-force attack at the closest range!

The world turned upside down!

The waters of the river of time exploded, causing the entire river to tremble with a thunderous roar!

A massive mountain-breaking ox was shattered into pieces, its Great Dao crumbling, dead beyond any hope of revival. A giant beast resembling a frog was also instantly torn apart, its body exploding, its Great Dao severed, and the power of laws swept across the area, detonating violently!

A giant beast akin to a fierce tiger was similarly obliterated by a formidable force, leaving no trace of its bones!

...

In that instant, five rulers of laws were targeted by the crowd. They were the weaker ones at the back, positioned on the periphery, having just exerted their strength against Su Yu and his group, leaving them in a power vacuum.

In a flash, they were targeted by over thirty powerful experts, with an average of seven against one, catching them completely off guard...

This was an instant kill!

The opponents had almost no power to resist and were instantly obliterated. In a moment, five rulers of laws fell, their paths severed!

Only then did the Nether Emperor's roar echo out, "Underwater!"

Too late!

In that instant, five powerful beings had already perished.

Marquis Tongtian instantly retreated, and the others followed suit, all withdrawing!

The world fell silent!

Dead?

What just happened?

Where did these people... come from?

The Nether Emperor's expression changed completely. Where did these powerful beings come from?

How could there be so many!

They outnumbered them!

And at that moment, Su Yu's voice echoed from afar, "Kill!"

"Kill!"

Boom!

Over at the War King's side, the battle erupted instantly, even before the War King arrived. Su Yu, with a cold expression, unleashed his aura, returning with the Martial Emperor to intimidate all sides, "You can't escape! Kneel, seal yourselves, and I'll spare your lives!"

The Nether Emperor's expression changed completely. What was happening?

Where did they come from?

Moreover, why hadn't the Culture King and Martial King acted yet?

They had even fled earlier?

One thought after another flashed through his mind, but he had no time to ponder. He only knew that it was dangerous, very dangerous!

At that moment, the Human Emperor's physical body suddenly flew forward.

The Nether Emperor wanted to stop it, but it was too late!

He seemed to realize something, suddenly looking at Su Yu and the Martial Emperor, his eyes changing, gritting his teeth, "You... you... aren't..."

They didn't seem to be the Culture King and Martial King!

Impossible, then who were they?

He was truly confused!

But there was no time to think, boom!

Behind him, a great battle erupted, instantly killing five rulers of laws. The loss of combat power was secondary; the main issue was that everyone was terrified!

The opponents outnumbered them!

The Nether Emperor roared in anger, "Trap! Immortal Emperor... everyone, it's a trap, save us!"

They were surrounded!

Boom!

Over there, the myriad races were also stunned, and the humans were actually stunned too. What happened?

Did the Culture King and Martial King bring reinforcements?

Who cares!

At this moment, there was no time to think. The Human Emperor's grand voice echoed in all directions, "Kill, kill them all! Fight to the death!"

Boom!

The Human Emperor's phantom battled three great experts, while his physical body rapidly advanced in this direction. Over there, the Immortal Emperor couldn't care about the Nether Emperor and the others anymore, roaring, "Go, intercept his physical body!"

They couldn't let the Human Emperor's physical body come over!

One by one, the myriad races' experts quickly flew in that direction. There were already more myriad races' experts here, and they hurriedly dispatched seven or eight experts to attack the Human Emperor's physical body!

...

At this moment, Su Yu didn't care about being exposed or not.

Enough!

This time, the disguise had easily killed five rulers of laws, which was enough!

"You go kill those guys!"

Su Yu commanded, directing the Martial Emperor, who quickly broke through the air, charging into the crowd. At this moment, chaos reigned over there.

And Su Yu had always locked onto the Nether Emperor.

Sweat dripped from the Nether Emperor's forehead, and soon, he gritted his teeth, "You're not the Culture King, who are you?"

"Me? I'm your father!"

Su Yu laughed, brilliantly, suddenly pointing with a pen, "Let's play, don't think about running!"

"Run?"

The Nether Emperor snorted coldly, his eyes icy, and a chilling aura erupted instantly, transforming into ten thousand swords, shooting towards Su Yu, "You... are not first-class!"

Su Yu didn't seem to be first-class, yet he felt close.

He seemed similar to him.

In any case, at this moment, he was also very hesitant about what this guy's true strength was.

No time to care, kill!

The Nether Land covered the sky and earth, spreading towards Su Yu in an instant, while Su Yu also transformed his giant pen into a knife, slashing out!

The first slash wasn't too strong.

But in the middle, a powerful force of the physical body suddenly erupted, boom!

A loud noise echoed, and the Nether Emperor was directly slashed back by Su Yu, the Nether Land shattered!

The Nether Emperor was horrified!

At this moment, Su Yu truly reached a first-class level, and he was vaguely still rising.

Yes, Su Yu borrowed Gui's power, and at this moment, he quickly transmitted in the sea of will, "Gui, lend me your power, continue! My nemesis is here, I want to kill him!"

Behind the Heaven Gate, the old man was speechless, so soon?

Moreover, you can't kill a second-class peak!

This guy was really too arrogant, did he really think borrowing my power would allow a fourth-class to kill a second-class peak?

What was he thinking!

Despite this, he still began to continuously input power, but unfortunately, no matter how much he input, it seemed to be consumed quickly, and he couldn't help but curse, "If you can't win, don't persist, run away!"

What was going on?

The consumption was too great, enough for me to fight to the death with 16 rulers of laws!

...

Su Yu didn't care about him.

At this moment, he continuously extracted the other's power, partly enhancing himself, partly enhancing the world, making the power of the world more intense, and also strengthening others!

The power integrated by the Great Zhou King was also continuously being merged.

In this battle, he could only entangle this first-class.

Killing... was still up to others.

...

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian retreated to the rear, sweat pouring down his face.

He and Destiny, the three of them, were the hosts!

Everyone in Su Yu's world wasn't weak, but most were third-class, with almost no second-class, while the opponents, although fewer in number, had second-class, and not just one, but four second-class!

Of course, the Martial Emperor came!

As soon as he arrived, he entangled with a second-class, and the remaining three were now being fought by the South Heavenly King, Undead Emperor, and Chaos Dragon, along with three rulers of laws!

At this rate, it was just maintaining a balance.

If the three of them acted, they could gain some advantage.

But... it wasn't necessary!

In his ear, Destiny Marquis's voice came, "Number 13!"

They had numbered those myriad races' experts, and whoever Destiny Marquis called out meant that one could be killed, while whoever Wuming called out meant someone on their side was in danger and needed rescue.

The division of labor was clear!

Number 13!

Marquis Tongtian was startled, who could be killed, who to mobilize?

Who could be dispatched to kill?

In an instant, a power of teleportation fluctuated on the Martial Emperor, who cursed inwardly but didn't dare resist, this was Su Yu's order.

Teleporting them, either to help them escape or to kill!

Understood!

Kill!

He instantly disappeared with this power, the second-class on the opposite side struck empty, slightly stunned, instantly changing color, while the Martial Emperor also instantly appeared in front of a fourth-class ruler of laws.

His opponent was Xia Longwu, who was now covered in wounds, his flesh and blood blurred!

As soon as the Martial Emperor appeared, he didn't look at the battle situation, nor did he need to.

According to the previous agreement, teleporting in meant killing!

"Die!"

The Martial Emperor thrust out with all his might, boom!

The strongman from the myriad races, who had just dodged Xia Longwu's long blade, was pierced through by his spear, with a loud bang, his head exploded!

Xia Longwu's long blade followed, slicing through his body, causing it to explode, and his Great Dao was also shaken by the slash!

The sixth one!

Almost instantly, another ruler of laws was killed, and the second-class expert who had been dealing with the Martial Emperor hadn't found another opponent yet. In the blink of an eye, Xia Longwu and the Martial Emperor appeared before him, both attacking with a spear and a blade!

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian and the others were responsible for finding opportunities in battle, sending people to kill wherever there was a chance!

Deploying troops!

At this moment, Wuming suddenly said, "Number 9!"

Wuming reported those on their side who were in crisis.

Without thinking, Marquis Tongtian instantly mobilized their number 9. Over there, Hetu was about to make a move when his expression suddenly changed, disappearing instantly. Just as he vanished, a dark and terrifying power exploded where he had been!

That power even corroded a hole in the river of time!

And Hetu's previous opponent, the black-clad strongman, his eyes changed, revealing a trace of anger!

Abyssal Race!

Hetu, who had been moved away, turned pale, the curse-killing technique had no sign at all, he hadn't noticed it, if it weren't for Tongtian moving him, he would have been seriously injured!

The next moment, the power of teleportation reappeared, Xia Longwu and Hetu were moved together to the number 9 Abyssal Race strongman.

At this moment, someone roared, "It's Tongtian... they can teleport..."

Instant teleportation!

If you wanted to kill an opponent, they suddenly disappeared, and if you fell behind, several strongmen would suddenly appear before you to kill you!

The opponent's methods were terrifying!

The Nether Emperor's angry roar also suddenly came, "Kill Tongtian, quickly!"

Kill Tongtian!

Otherwise, with someone who could continuously teleport strongmen in the river of time, they would be completely suppressed, and the opponent could achieve the best combat power ratio!

Just after speaking, Tongtian teleported another person.

With a loud bang, March knocked a strongman dead with a bamboo, September grinned foolishly, showing a smile to March, still thinking March Ancestor was amazing, he had been fighting for a long time, and March Ancestor came and killed the opponent.

The seventh one!

At this point, the Nether Emperor could no longer endure, and the others were actually extremely fearful. As more people died, their danger increased!

"Retreat!"

The Nether Emperor roared, retreat!

If they didn't retreat, something might happen!

A group of rulers of laws fled outward, retreating!

This place was no longer tenable!

Su Yu swung his blade, forcing the Nether Emperor to retreat. He frowned slightly and shouted, "Heaven Gate!"

"......"

The Martial Emperor was taken aback. Damn it! Is it really necessary? Aren't we already gaining the upper hand? This doesn't seem right!

Su Yu's voice was icy as he repeated, "Heaven Gate!"

The Martial Emperor gritted his teeth, feeling reluctant and helpless. Damn it, why? The battle has just begun! If these people want to escape, we can just chase them down. Why do I have to sacrifice the Heaven Gate?

Despite his reluctance, he manifested the Heaven Gate, which instantly appeared before Marquis Tongtian. Without a second thought, Marquis Tongtian swallowed it whole, as Su Yu had instructed earlier. At a critical moment, he was to consume the Martial Emperor's Heaven Gate!

The Heaven Gate was instantly devoured! Since it was willingly offered by the Martial Emperor, there wasn't much resistance. As Marquis Tongtian absorbed the Heaven Gate, his aura surged and continued to grow!

"Seal!"

Marquis Tongtian roared, unleashing a powerful sealing force that swept over the opponent who had been battling the Martial Emperor. The opponent's figure momentarily froze, and at that moment, Su Yu's voice rang out again, "Explode!"

He was telling the Martial Emperor that he could detonate his Dao now!

The Martial Emperor almost felt like dying from frustration! Was it necessary? I could handle the opponent on my own! But... but...

"Ah!"

The Martial Emperor went a bit crazy, letting out a furious roar. A Dao path suddenly manifested, and with a thunderous explosion, it blasted towards the opponent temporarily sealed by Marquis Tongtian!

The power of a second-tier Dao was immense. In an instant, it exploded.

Boom!

The powerful being, momentarily sealed, had no time to react before his body was shattered by the overwhelming power of laws!

A force of heaven and earth descended, directly suppressing the Dao of the second-tier expert. The Martial Emperor and Marquis Tongtian joined forces, launching a fierce assault, breaking the Dao, which was then devoured by Su Yu's world!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's Dao was instantly reconnected, but... his strength had significantly declined, dropping to the third tier!

However, a second-tier expert had been killed!

The opponent wasn't insignificant either. To reach the second tier was no small feat. The slain expert hailed from the Hellhound Clan, a formidable opponent, yet he was killed in an instant!

The Nether Emperor, who was fleeing, had a drastic change in expression!

Dead?

The eighth one!

And this time, it was a second-tier expert!

Second-tier experts were top-tier powerhouses!

Several had died in quick succession, altering the course of the battle. Marquis Tongtian roared, his strength enhanced by the Heaven Gate, his teleportation abilities even stronger. In a blink, the Martial Emperor and others who had killed their opponents appeared before the Abyssal Race's powerhouses.

The Abyssal Race expert's face turned pale!

But it was useless!

The Martial Emperor, in a fit of rage, roared. Despite falling to the third tier, he still managed to send the opponent flying with a spear. March, September, and others joined in, along with Xia Longwu and Hetu, tearing the expert apart in an instant!

The ninth one!

Over there, the Human Emperor and others felt like they had just started fighting, but explosions kept echoing from the other side. When the Divine Emperor glanced over... he was stunned!

Boom! He was struck by the Human Emperor's shadow, coughing up blood, but he couldn't help but be dazed.

Damn it!

How did so many people die so quickly?

In just a moment, nine rulers of laws had died, including a second-tier expert. In all these years of war, the death of a second-tier expert was a rare occurrence!

At this moment, Su Yu's voice rang out again, "March!"

Marquis Tongtian instantly teleported March to the South Heavenly King's side. Without a word, March produced a bamboo pole, incredibly powerful. March couldn't fully utilize its power, but that didn't matter now!

Su Yu had set some rules earlier. When he called, they had to act!

March was reluctant... this was a treasure he had fought hard to obtain, battling Giant Bamboo, Heavendoom, and September for it. But... there was no choice!

March's face was filled with pain!

The next moment, he gritted his teeth, and with a thunderous explosion, an old man's shadow appeared in the void. The old man, expressionless, wielded the bamboo pole. As it exploded, he struck the second-tier expert opposing the South Heavenly King!

The second-tier expert, an Ape Clan powerhouse, was horrified!

What was this?

He tried to escape!

But the bamboo pole wielded by the old man seemed to carry an immense, sticky force, pinning him in place. With a single strike, the massive ape's skull was shattered!

March, the South Heavenly King, and others immediately attacked, shattering the opponent's body and breaking his Dao!

The tenth one!

And the second second-tier expert!

...

Su Yu was truly willing to sacrifice!

The Martial Emperor's Heaven Gate, the Dao, and the Human Ancestor's bamboo pole, all could have enhanced his own power, but Su Yu didn't care. Blowing them up to kill two second-tier experts wasn't satisfying enough?

Four second-tier experts, and two were taken down in an instant!

At this moment, the Battle King finally broke through the defensive line and charged over... stunned to find them dead?

So quickly?

He was fast!

He had broken through the line blocking the Human Emperor's physical body, ignoring it to charge over, yet he was still late. Su Yu's side had already killed a third of them!

The Nether Emperor was truly anxious now, roaring again, "Retreat, at all costs! Quickly!"

Two second-tier experts had been killed in an instant!

It was over!

Moreover, the South Heavenly King and others were all freed, and the Battle King had arrived.

In the distance, the Divine Emperor and others saw this and roared, "Kill! Charge over there and join them!"

Many had died!

But with their numbers, they weren't afraid!

They quickly charged towards Su Yu's side!

The Immortal Emperor's eyes flashed with countless divine lights as he looked over, his expression changing quickly. He shouted, "Leave that area, it's been irradiated by him!"

He seemed to have noticed something.

"Distracted while fighting me?"

Boom!

A thunderous explosion echoed as the Human Emperor's shadow suddenly smashed down with a massive seal. The explosion reverberated through the heavens, sending the Immortal Emperor flying, coughing up blood, with countless rules of power spilling out!

At this moment, everyone paused, looking at the massive seal in the sky!

It wasn't the Xingyu Imprint, but the most powerful weapon, the Human Lord Seal!

The Human Lord Seal, wielded by the Human Emperor!

With just one strike, the Immortal Emperor was severely injured!

However, everyone also saw the Human Emperor's shadow trembling violently, on the verge of collapse!

The Divine Emperor's face twisted with rage, "Are you courting death? If you want to die, then continue, we'll fulfill your wish!"

With one strike, the Human Emperor severely injured the Immortal Emperor, but his own sea of will trembled violently, a sign of severe injury.

The Divine Emperor and others were somewhat afraid, fearing that this guy truly intended to kill them at the cost of his life!

Boom!

The Human Emperor didn't care at all. Would I be scared by you? You can kill me if you can!

The Immortal Emperor was severely injured, and the remaining two powerhouses could no longer afford to be distracted, roaring with all their might as they fought fiercely!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu reappeared before the Nether Emperor, calmly saying, "Can you escape?"

The Nether Emperor panted, looking at Su Yu, then at the besieged and falling powerhouses, gritting his teeth, he coldly said, "You should know, I'm a first-tier. If I truly fight to the death... do you think you'll fare well?"

"Is this your world? If I go all out and shatter your world, you won't have a good ending either!"

"Then try it!"

Su Yu blocked his path again. The Nether Emperor was anxious, no longer caring about much, he roared, and a spear appeared, filled with the power of death, thrusting towards Su Yu, accompanied by a gust of cold wind!

Su Yu kept dodging, but he wouldn't let the opponent pass, continuously absorbing the power of the Dao spilling throughout the world!

Having killed so many rulers of laws, with the Martial Emperor severing his Dao, and the constant power being provided, when else would he nurture his world if not now?

The power of his world grew increasingly dense.

Meanwhile, with the Battle King's arrival, many powerhouses were slain. Marquis Tongtian felt much more at ease, constantly listening to the reminders from the Fate Clan's two powerhouses, relocating powerhouses from all directions!

Boom!

Another explosion erupted as a top-tier powerhouse was slain on the spot by the combined efforts of the Battle King and others!

The Battle King hadn't received the Heaven Gate imprint from Marquis Tongtian. He had just killed someone and hadn't had time to celebrate when the people around him vanished, reappearing before the last second-tier ruler of laws.

At this moment, the South Heavenly King, March, the Martial Emperor, the Chaos Dragon, the Eight-Winged Tiger, Xia Longwu...

Several powerhouses attacked together, the second-tier expert roared in fury, unable to match them, filled with despair. Just as his Dao was about to explode, Marquis Tongtian roared, the power of the portal surged again, suppressing the opponent for a moment!

And in that moment, it was enough for everyone to kill him!

Boom!

Seven or eight powerhouses joined forces, shattering the opponent into pieces!

As the Dao exploded, these people were teleported away again, just as the Battle King arrived... Boom! He was sent flying by a massive force, coughing up blood, feeling a bit speechless and frustrated!

I... damn it!

He wasn't as fast as them, they were all teleported away, he was running. He arrived, but they had finished, he couldn't even catch up to eat their dust, yet he caught up to the explosion of their Dao!

Marquis Tongtian was also helpless!

"Battle King, stop causing trouble!"

Marquis Tongtian still shouted, a bit frustrated, "If you die, my mission fails, stop causing trouble!"

You don't have my portal imprint!

I can't teleport you!

What are you doing?

If you get blown up, I can't explain it.

At this moment, the Battle King, a second-tier peak powerhouse, felt frustrated, helpless, pained, and dejected!

I... am very powerful!

I'm not here to cause trouble, I'm here to help!

To help, understand?

At this moment, Su Yu's voice echoed, "Battle King, come over here to help!"

Stop causing trouble!

It seemed like the second-tier ones were all killed, so the Battle King should come here to block the Nether Emperor!

Over there, more than a dozen rulers of laws had been slain, leaving only half remaining! At this moment, Tongtian and the others were about to finish their battle. Even two against one seemed excessive!

Su Yu calculated the time and suddenly shouted, "One minute! I'll give you one more minute to finish the fight!"

"Understood!"

A chorus of shouts erupted, followed by a thunderous explosion as another ruler of laws was killed on the spot!

Meanwhile, Su Yu's power surged dramatically. He stopped enhancing others and channeled all the power into himself. With a single slash, he struck the Nether Emperor, causing blood to gush from his hands!

At this moment, the Battle King arrived, panting heavily. "All I did was run!"

The Nether Emperor, desperate to escape, roared in fury when he saw the Battle King blocking his path. With a spear thrust, the power of his dao surged forth, sending the Battle King flying. The Battle King didn't even have time to draw his blade before he was sent soaring far away by the ferocious attack.

"I..."

The Battle King wasn't severely injured, but he felt humiliated! Everywhere he went to join the battle, he was quickly repelled! If not blasted away, then thrown out! Despite being a second-tier peak expert, he hadn't been much help and had even gotten injured! He might be the first under Su Yu's command to get hurt... No, he wasn't even under Su Yu's command.

Su Yu didn't pay attention to the Battle King at this moment. The brief obstruction provided by the Battle King was enough. He was still useful; an ordinary expert might have been killed, but the Battle King was strong, and the Nether Emperor couldn't easily kill him. In fact, he couldn't kill him at all. Thus, the Battle King was still very useful, the best roadblock!

As the Nether Emperor sent the Battle King flying, Su Yu slashed out. Though the attack wasn't aimed directly at him, the Nether Emperor's face changed as the space before him warped, and he suddenly appeared in front of Su Yu's blade. With a swift slash, his arm was severed!

The Nether Emperor was shocked! He had been influenced by Su Yu's power of laws and had unwittingly delivered himself to be struck!

Meanwhile, the battle continued. On the other side, a powerful being, unable to endure the siege any longer, detonated himself with a thunderous explosion!

The self-detonation injured several experts. Tongtian couldn't relocate everyone in time, leaving the strongest, the Martial Emperor, to bear the brunt of the explosion, leaving him covered in blood. He couldn't help but curse, "Why was I left behind?"

He was indignant! Today was his unluckiest day! Someone self-detonated, and he was left behind to take the hit! Tongtian ignored him. "Nonsense, you're strong now. The explosion won't kill you. If others were left behind, they'd die!"

With the self-detonation of this powerful being, the battlefield suddenly had far fewer people. Su Yu's side still had the same number of people, while the other side had only about ten rulers of laws left. These ten blood-soaked experts finally regrouped, but their faces were filled with despair.

What was going on? Even now, they might still be confused! But nearly twenty rulers of laws had died! And on the opposite side, over thirty rulers of laws had them completely surrounded!

How could they escape? They were utterly bewildered. The Martial King had detonated his dao and still possessed third-tier power. What was going on? Why were Tongtian and the others here? Where was the Culture King?

Even now, some people hadn't figured out the situation. Time had passed too quickly, and all they saw was people being killed continuously!

At this moment, among the regrouped experts, someone roared, "If you come any closer, we'll all self-detonate! With so many rulers of laws self-detonating, many of you will surely die!"

If ten rulers of laws self-detonated, you would suffer heavy losses, even if you tried to relocate!

At this point, they could only rely on this threat to deter the enemy! Otherwise, they would be killed if this continued!

The ten experts of the myriad races erupted with their auras, showing a determination to fight to the death. Even if they died, they wouldn't let the enemy have it easy!

"Let us leave..."

Someone offered terms. They wanted to leave this place, to escape this terrifying place! This battle had been utterly baffling! Suddenly, over thirty rulers of laws appeared, which no one had expected!

At this moment, Tongtian hesitated. If ten rulers of laws self-detonated, he couldn't guarantee that his side would be unharmed. Some might die, but if they didn't stay together, these people might escape. What should he do?

He quickly looked towards Su Yu, unsure of what decision to make at this point.

At this moment, Su Yu's eyes were cold and sharp. The next moment, he shouted, "Human Emperor!"

With this shout, the Human Emperor, who was in the midst of a fierce battle, instantly looked over, his face changing as he felt the urge to curse!

Damn it! I get it!

"You..."

He wanted to curse, but... forget it, he wouldn't curse!

At this moment, the Human Emperor, who was charging the front lines, suddenly retreated at an incredible speed.

Su Yu roared, "Kill them!"

Tongtian's face changed, and the ten rulers of laws also changed their expressions. Someone gritted their teeth and roared, "Fight to the death, self-detonate, blow them up!"

Boom!

A violent explosion echoed through the heavens and earth. At this moment, the Human Emperor's body suddenly transformed into a massive mountain, covering the area of the explosion!

Rumble!

After a series of loud explosions, everything fell silent. The Human Emperor's body, tattered and broken, fell heavily into the river like a rag.

Su Yu nodded slightly, not bad! My people weren't injured. The Human Emperor's body was truly strong! Impressive!

The self-detonation of ten rulers of laws didn't shatter his body to pieces. Impressive, truly impressive! Making use of waste, Su Yu had noticed that the Human Emperor's injuries weren't light. Since that was the case... getting injured a bit more wasn't a big deal. Didn't it exchange for the lives of many strong enemies?

"The Human Emperor understands me!"

Su Yu laughed heartily. Truly reliable! I shouted once, and you knew what I meant. Impressive! As expected of the Human Emperor! Admirable, truly admirable!

At this moment, everyone else was utterly shocked! This... is this how things are done? Everyone on the human side was puzzled. He wasn't the Culture King, so who was he? But just like the Culture King... cunning and ruthless!

He actually used the Human Emperor's body as a shield! This... was too ruthless! The key point was, the Human Emperor actually did it!

Of course, the results were spectacular! In the blink of an eye, on Su Yu's side, apart from the Nether Emperor, everyone else had been slaughtered by his people! The entire long river trembled violently, too many rulers of laws had died!
