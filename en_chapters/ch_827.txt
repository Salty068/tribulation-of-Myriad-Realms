Chapter 827: The List

Five ancient beasts were slain, making this fishing trip quite fruitful. However, with the Gate of Hell sealed and the chaotic will shattered, fishing for more would be troublesome. If too many came and forced the Gate of Hell to open prematurely, Su Yu would be in deep trouble.

The five ancient beasts, rulers of laws, were integrated into Su Yu's world, causing it to expand rapidly. Meanwhile, the Tea Plant began devouring the chaotic will. It took half, while the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger shared the other half. Despite the disparity in strength, the Chaos Dragon was already close to being a fifth-tier ruler of laws, needing only a catalyst to break through, much like a Heavenly Venerable breaking a seal.

As Su Yu finished digesting his gains, the Chaos Dragon's aura was the first to change.

Boom!

Countless chaotic forces surged toward the Chaos Dragon. Su Yu quickly focused his attention on it. The Chaos Dragon, being from the Chaos Ancient Clan, couldn't break through outside the Gate of Hell. What catalyst did it need now?

Su Yu observed closely, opening his Heaven Gate to see how the ancient clans broke through outside. What role did the chaotic will play?

Through his Heaven Gate, Su Yu saw something unusual. As the Chaos Dragon was about to break through, the power of the River of Time from the lower realm seemed to extend toward it, though not very prominently. More noticeable was the Gate of Hell.

At this moment, a chain appeared on the silent Gate of Hell, flying toward the Chaos Dragon. The chain was invisible and silent, aiming to lock onto the Chaos Dragon's chaotic path.

"A chain?" Su Yu murmured. The Gate of Hell had unleashed a chain, preventing those outside from breaking through. The chain began to lock onto the chaotic path.

However, at that moment, shadows of powerful ancient beasts emerged from the Chaos Dragon, representing the will of strong beings within the chaotic will. These wills manifested, and as the chain attacked, they exploded one after another.

The Chaos Dragon's chaotic path rapidly expanded, taking advantage of the chain's entanglement with the shadows. In an instant, the path grew significantly, and the Chaos Dragon's power vanished into the chaos, disappearing from sight.

The chain, having destroyed the shadows, hesitated briefly before retreating back to the Gate of Hell.

This scene went unnoticed by others, but Su Yu saw it clearly.

"The Gate of Hell…" Su Yu murmured. So that's how it is! Trying to break through outside would trigger the Gate of Hell's blockade. The chain was invisible and immensely powerful, making it nearly impossible to break through under normal circumstances.

The chaotic will's role was to attract the chain, allowing the Chaos Dragon to seize the opportunity and break through. Once the breakthrough was complete, the chain seemed to lose interest.

Su Yu pondered, "If the chaotic will were replaced with another strong will, would it work?" Probably not, as the chain might not be interested in other wills. The chain was meant to lock down the Chaos Ancient Clan.

"So, it's the portal that seals them!" Or perhaps, the one who sealed the era left something to lock down the Chaos Ancient Clan, preventing them from producing strong beings to interfere with the next era. The effect was quite effective!

The Chaos Era had essentially vanished. Even with many ancient beasts remaining, they couldn't disrupt the Myriad Realms due to the lack of powerful beings. The Chaos Dragon was among the strongest, yet it couldn't interfere with the Myriad Realms.

"Unable to interfere with the next era, does that mean the era is sealed?" Su Yu suddenly had a thought. The powerhouses of the Opening Era couldn't interfere with the present, so the Opening Era was considered sealed. Was the Ancient Era sealed? Probably not! The Martial Emperor and others from the Ancient Era were still interfering with this era. Would there come a day when they couldn't interfere, and that would mean they were sealed?

What did the Human Gate seal?

As these thoughts arose, the Chaos Dragon roared with excitement. Su Yu's voice was cold, "Quiet down!"

The Chaos Dragon, having just broken through, was about to lash out with its tail but suddenly sobered up. It seemed to recognize Su Yu. Forget it! In an instant, the Chaos Dragon quieted down. After all, five of its predecessors had just perished here, so it decided to behave.

At this moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger seemed on the verge of breaking through as well. Su Yu's eyes turned peculiar. Some people, when they scheme too much, end up unlucky.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was such a representative.

The Eight-Winged Tiger, also a top-tier Heavenly Venerable, was in the same realm as the Chaos Dragon, capable of instantly stepping into the ruler of laws. However, it had been waiting to see the Chaos Dragon's breakthrough effect. Now, seeing the Chaos Dragon succeed, it decided to break through, revealing its cunning nature.

But…

The chain only appeared when the Chaos Dragon was about to break through. There was a reaction time!

Now, as the Eight-Winged Tiger began its breakthrough, its aura fluctuated. In the unseen realm, a chain suddenly appeared!

Beside Su Yu, the Martial Emperor's eyes widened, and he muttered under his breath, "Truly pitiful, scholars are never good people, and neither are scholarly tigers. Serves it right!"

He was deliberately speaking out loud! A coward with a sharp tongue! He was saying it for Su Yu to hear, that those who scheme too much never end well!

Others couldn't see it, and even the Eight-Winged Tiger couldn't see it, but Su Yu and the Martial Emperor could, as they had opened their Heaven Gates. They saw the chain swiftly flying toward the Eight-Winged Tiger.

Above the Eight-Winged Tiger, shadows of several giant beasts appeared, but these shadows were shattered much faster than before. At this rate, before the Eight-Winged Tiger could fully break through, its chaotic path would be locked!

It seemed unlikely to succeed, and like the Chaos Dragon before, it would be stuck here for life until the Gate of Hell was unsealed.

"The Chaos Dragon broke through first, and the chain took time to activate. But now it's already active, just returned… The Eight-Winged Tiger was too impatient. Otherwise, waiting for the Gate of Hell to settle would have been fine!"

Su Yu quickly assessed the situation. It was as if the Gate of Hell's mechanism had been activated. Previously, it needed to be turned on, but now it didn't, and it could be deployed instantly!

The difference might be just a few seconds, but those few seconds were enough to doom the Eight-Winged Tiger!

Over-scheming leads to losses.

As for the Martial Emperor's words, Su Yu ignored him. The Eight-Winged Tiger suffered because it couldn't see the root cause. If it could, it wouldn't have been so foolish.

At this moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger seemed to sense something. As it devoured the chaotic will and attempted to break through, it suddenly felt the chaotic will shattering!

In the next moment, it seemed to see a chain aiming to lock its path!

This wasn't something it saw but sensed with its will.

It… seemed to be failing!

The Eight-Winged Tiger roared violently, "Impossible! Didn't the Chaos Dragon succeed just now? Why am I failing?"

"Roar!"

The tiger roared madly, its eight wings flapping frantically as it tried to escape. But it was futile; the chain followed relentlessly, impossible to evade.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was in despair!

No, this was its only chance. If it didn't break through now, would it have to wait for the Gate of Hell to open? Ridiculous! It and the Chaos Dragon had offended those ancient beasts. Once the Gate of Hell opened, it would be doomed. Forget breaking through; it would be lucky to survive. The only option was to break through now, gain some benefits, and see if it could become a third-tier existence.

A third-tier being wasn't weak in any era. At that point, those ancient beasts wouldn't trouble it.

But now, it seemed to be failing.

In the next moment, it seemed to think of something and cried out, "Your Majesty, save me!"

Su Yu's voice came calmly, "You won't die, just won't break through. Your strength will still increase. What's there to save?"

Besides, I owe you nothing. I gave you the chaotic will.

"Your Majesty… I submit, I'll be Your Majesty's mount… Your Majesty needs a mount…"

At this moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger was overwhelmed with a sense of crisis. It felt it had no chance. If it didn't break through now, it would be doomed, sealed, unable to break through, and would have to wait for another opportunity.

But opportunities don't always come.

…

In the distance, Su Yu watched silently.

Suddenly, the world trembled, chaotic forces stirred, transforming into a sharp sword aimed at the chain!

Chaotic will!

The Creator could naturally transform myriad paths into chaos, as all paths were originally born from chaos.

Su Yu was merely testing it out.

The chains, as it turned out, were merely procedural and couldn't distinguish between true and false. Or perhaps, Su Yu's chaotic will was indeed genuine. Instantly, the chains swung and bound the chaotic sword. However, Su Yu didn't bother to engage further. The sword suddenly transformed into the power of myriad paths, causing the chains to lose their target and once again aim for the Eight-Winged Tiger.

"Interesting!" Su Yu chuckled. The Martial Emperor watched for a moment but didn't find it particularly intriguing.

Su Yu said calmly, "Isn't this interesting enough? When the myriad paths transform into chaos, they are targeted, but when chaos transforms into the myriad paths, they are not!"

The Martial Emperor was speechless. What was so special about that?

Su Yu continued to transform the myriad paths into chaos, once again attracting the chains. He murmured, "Isn't it clear yet? Foolish! If I can capture or analyze the composition of these chains, perhaps I can deal with the Chaos Ancient Clan! Any ancient clan that appears, I can bind with a single chain! These chains are highly targeted!"

"And they're invisible and silent. Apart from us, no one else can see them or sense them... When my world is filled with such chains, my people will be fine, but once the Chaos Ancient Clan arrives, they'll be instantly bound... It's practically a huge trap!"

"At that time, capturing ancient beasts will be much easier!"

Really?

The Martial Emperor thought for a moment and shook his head. He couldn't be bothered to analyze it. What's the big deal with ancient beasts? They can be killed too! Why bother binding them?

Su Yu ignored him. The Martial Emperor was an idiot; talking to him was pointless. The chains didn't seem particularly powerful to Su Yu, but they appeared to be highly effective against the chaotic path. He really wanted to capture one to test it out! What exactly were these chains made of? What great path composed them? Their targeting of chaos was indeed formidable. Perhaps, from these chains, he could find a way to deal with the ancient clans behind the Gate of Hell.

As he tangled with the chains, suddenly, in the distance, the Eight-Winged Tiger roared. With a thunderous sound, its great path grew powerful, and in the blink of an eye, it vanished into the chaos, causing the chains to disappear!

Su Yu turned to look at the Eight-Winged Tiger. The next moment, before the tiger could even celebrate, Su Yu's cold voice echoed in its ears, "You're finished!"

Damn thing! It broke through at the wrong time!

I was just about to capture that thing, and now it's gone because of the breakthrough!

Su Yu cursed. If he had captured those chains, they might have been of great use to him. Now, he could only rely on the Tea Plant, but it was still in the process of devouring, its aura just barely reaching the Heavenly King level. As for becoming a Heavenly Venerable, that would take some time. Of course, if it could directly break through, the Tea Plant might not necessarily reach the Heavenly Venerable level. Heavenly Venerables only appeared because they were sealed and couldn't break through. Without the seal, there would be no Heavenly Venerable level.

Just like the powerful beings under Su Yu's command now, some Heavenly Kings could directly break through to the Master of Law realm because there was no such thing as a Heavenly Venerable in an unsealed era.

In ancient times, Heavenly Kings were called quasi-kings, essentially the reserve forces for the Human Emperor.

...

In the distance, the Eight-Winged Tiger's eyes flickered, cursing inwardly. I've already broken through, what else could I do? From Su Yu's words, it seemed I wasn't supposed to break through?

Frustrating!

Today, I almost failed. Not only was I unlucky, but now the Eight-Winged Tiger was considering whether to keep its previous promise. To save itself earlier, it had promised to become Su Yu's mount!

But now, it had become a Master of Law. Although not as strong as the Chaos Dragon, it was still a fourth-tier power. Heavenly Venerables were inherently stronger than Heavenly Kings when breaking through. In ancient times, when Heavenly Kings broke through, they generally had the strength of a weak fourth-tier.

Especially for top-tier Heavenly Venerables like them!

Not weak at all!

Becoming someone's mount... the Eight-Winged Tiger had never considered that.

At this moment, Su Yu said nothing. The world trembled, and in the next moment, the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger were swept over by Su Yu.

Although the two ancient beasts had just broken through and their auras were not weak, they were still somewhat apprehensive when facing Su Yu.

After all, five of them had just died!

Especially now, in Su Yu's world, it was even more dangerous. Outside of Su Yu's world, it would be much safer.

Su Yu glanced at the two ancient beasts, remained silent for a moment, and then said calmly, "Two paths: first, go behind the Gate of Hell, and I'll give you a chance to leave! Second, stay with me obediently, and if I go upstream, you must come with me!"

The two ancient beasts knew what Su Yu's intentions were. At this moment, they looked at each other.

Should they go behind the Gate of Hell, or follow Su Yu?

As for going deep into the chaos... Su Yu would never agree to that!

Even the Martial Emperor couldn't do it before; Su Yu would kill them without hesitation.

While the Eight-Winged Tiger was still pondering, the Chaos Dragon quickly said, "I'll choose the second path!"

No other reason, the area behind the Gate of Hell might be more dangerous. Besides, they had offended quite a few ancient beasts. He didn't want to go in and court death now. Following Su Yu for a while might even lead to further improvement in strength.

Su Yu nodded slightly, saying calmly, "Then behave yourself, and don't overthink it!"

With that, he didn't even look at the Eight-Winged Tiger. With a wave of his hand, the two ancient beasts were moved to the edge of the world. The Eight-Winged Tiger wanted to speak but stopped, realizing Su Yu's meaning.

You have no right to speak!

Because now, you're considered my mount, even if I might not ride you!

The Eight-Winged Tiger was utterly dejected. It was over. Making reckless promises to Su Yu had led to this.

...

On this day, Su Yu himself gained a lot, and both the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon broke through consecutively. As for the Tea Plant, it was slightly weaker, but Su Yu saw it continuing to devour chaotic will and didn't interfere. It still had a good chance of stepping into the Master of Law realm.

...

At this point, Su Yu's world was filled with many powerful beings. In his world, the Martial Emperor remained unchanged, still at the peak of the third tier. There were quite a few fourth-tier Masters of Law.

The Great Zhou King, Giant Axe, Destiny, South Heavenly King, Hongmeng, Consort Qi, Red Moon, Blood Shadow, and the Undead Emperor had returned to the Death Realm. He hadn't integrated into Su Yu's world, as doing so would likely lead to his demise.

Many powerful beings hadn't broken through before and needed some time to integrate into Su Yu's world.

For instance, March, Skyfire, Marquis Lanshan, and the previously powerful Wu Ji. Since they hadn't broken through at that time, they were now at this level, unable to directly become Masters of Law. However, these Heavenly Venerables had deep insights into the great paths, so it was only a matter of time.

Moreover, those at the Heavenly King level, as long as they had sufficient insight, could become pseudo-Masters of Law under Su Yu. There were many Heavenly Kings.

The Great Qin King, Great Xia King, and others had already possessed Heavenly King-level combat power after integrating. Now, with Su Yu's world expanding, they were just a step away from mastering the rules.

However, as Su Yu's world expanded, if these people didn't seize the opportunity, the stronger they became later, the harder it would be to advance in realm.

Because by then, Su Yu's great paths would be more perfected.

If you can't grasp the great paths now, it will be even more difficult later.

...

At this moment, Su Yu's subordinates were indeed a gathering of talents!

But it was still not enough.

If the Human Emperor were unharmed, taking these people with him would likely be quite helpful. Of course, outside of Su Yu's world, everyone's strength would be somewhat suppressed, but the results should still be good.

However, the Human Emperor was an empty shell, so that wouldn't work.

At this moment, if Su Yu took people with him, it would only be asking for trouble.

Therefore, Su Yu's target was once again the River of Time, to pluck its wool!

If the Master of Time were alive, he would probably be furious, but Su Yu had no choice. If he didn't pluck the Master of Time's wool now, what else could he do?

He needed to strengthen his world, not to the level of the Master of Time, but at least to ensure that the strong in his world wouldn't be much weaker than those in the River of Time when they went out.

This was still achievable!

Reaching the level of the River of Time was impossible, but the strong in the River of Time were just tributaries. As long as Su Yu made his world stronger than dozens of tributaries, he wouldn't need to maintain hundreds or thousands of Masters of Law.

Maintaining dozens of strong Masters of Law without falling behind would be enough!

The River of Time provides for countless strong beings, while Su Yu would only need to provide for a few strong ones. This way, he could narrow the gap between his world's strong and the others.

...

Lower Realm.

Su Yu returned.

Human Realm.

This was Su Yu's return to the Human Realm after two months.

The Myriad Realms were at peace!

When Su Yu returned with his people, cheers suddenly erupted, shaking the heavens and earth.

Thirty-six prefects, along with some Sunmoon Realm experts, waited at the entrance of the Human Realm, cheering. Su Yu had returned, and in less than three months, he had quelled the chaos of the Myriad Realms.

He had captured the Hundred Battle King in one fell swoop!

At the front of the crowd, Xia Huyou couldn't stop smiling. It was so fast. They knew Su Yu could fight back, but this speed was beyond everyone's expectations. Xia Huyou shouted loudly, "Welcome back, Your Majesty Emperor Yu, triumphant return! Victory!"

"Victory!"

The jubilant cries echoed!

Su Yu also smiled, looking at the Human Realm. It seemed fine. The Hundred Battle King had been in the Human Realm for too short a time to make any changes, nor did he have the mind to change anything.

The Human Realm was still the same as before.

Su Yu laughed heartily, "No wars in the Myriad Realms! Those humans who migrated to the Abyssal Realm may not have the heart to return now! I've already transformed it into a holy land!"

"However, I will soon migrate the Abyssal Realm, moving it beneath the Human Realm!"

"Let the Space Ancient Beast Race set up a teleportation array between the two realms! The Human Realm can be divided into upper and lower realms, free to travel!"

Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.

Nanyuan City, Great Xia Prefecture.

Su Family.

The relocation of millions of humans to the Abyssal Realm had just settled, and they might not be willing to return. However, the Human Realm was still their foundation. Su Yu did not wish to force anyone, so he decided to expend some effort to move the Abyssal Realm beneath the Human Realm. This way, with the help of Marquis Tongtian and the Space Ancient Beast Race, connecting the realms wouldn't be a significant issue. Those who wished to return could do so, while those who didn't could remain in the Abyssal Realm.

"Your Majesty is wise!"

Cheers erupted once more!

This was indeed good news. The Human Realm was expanding its territory. Although the Abyssal Realm was below, it didn't matter much. The territory was larger, offering more living options for the human race. Crucially, they wouldn't have to leave their homeland. They would still be on the land of the Human Realm!

On this day, the Human Realm was filled with jubilant cries, grand feasts were held, celebrating the unification of the myriad realms. Su Yu's name was mythologized, and now, no one dared to call him by his name directly. He was referred to as Emperor Yu. Just like the Human Emperor, as time passed, his real name was forgotten, replaced by his title.

In this new era of the cosmos, Su Yu's title even overshadowed that of the Human Emperor. The Human Emperor was too distant, but Emperor Yu was right beside them, having achieved the unification of heaven and earth!

...

Luminous Domain Mansion.

Previously occupied by Hundred Battle King, it now welcomed its rightful owner once more. The once empty grand hall was now truly a gathering of heroes. This was a meeting above the Daofuse Realm. Last time, at most, over thirty Daofuse cultivators attended, which was already astonishing. Now, the entire Luminous Domain Mansion had over 200 Daofuse cultivators!

As Su Yu's world expanded, many people's strength rose with the tide, stepping into the Daofuse Realm. Some of the older human eternals directly crossed into the Daofuse Realm. Hundred Battle King and Zhou Ji integrated the power of the human physical dao into Su Yu's world, allowing those who chose the physical dao and re-integrated into Su Yu's world to seize the opportunity to step into the Daofuse Realm!

The grand hall was packed.

Of course, some non-Daofuse cultivators were also allowed entry, such as the 36 prefects who stayed behind in the Human Realm, led by Xia Huyou, all qualified to attend the meeting. From the Death Realm, the Undead Emperor was also summoned to attend this high-level meeting at the Luminous Domain Mansion.

In the grand hall.

Su Yu had long been seated, gently tapping the table as if pondering something. The entire hall was silent. Everyone looked at Su Yu, some with admiration, some with fear, and some with complex emotions.

Especially those from Hundred Battle King's side, previously following Wu Ji and others who severed their paths to integrate, not just a few Heavenly Venerables, but also figures like Marquis Zhennan and Marquis Nanxi, chose to pledge allegiance to Su Yu. Just a few days ago, this was still the place where Hundred Battle King held meetings. Now, they had returned, but the owner had changed.

For Marquis Zhennan... here, he had experienced several special meetings. The first time, he was captured by Su Yu, and here, Su Yu held the first Daofuse meeting. Not long after, Su Yu left the Human Realm, Hundred Battle King returned, and as a subordinate of Hundred Battle King, he participated in the return ceremony. But soon after, the rightful owner returned, and the Luminous Domain Mansion's master was once again Su Yu, while Hundred Battle King had fallen.

Above.

Su Yu was silent for a while, pondering, then spoke, "The war of the myriad realms has ended! It is both an end and a beginning! The Human Emperor and others are now confirmed to be upstream of the River of Time! Moreover, the situation is not very good!"

"Although the Human Emperor is not dead, it is said he is seriously injured, and the other rulers of laws are all wounded!"

Su Yu paused, and below, Wan Tiansheng stepped forward, "Your Majesty, how does the strength comparison between the myriad races and our human race stand now?"

Su Yu smiled and said, "The specifics are unclear, but back then, the myriad races had over a hundred rulers of laws! There were 99 council members, and some non-council members also possessed the strength of rulers of laws! That's over a hundred! The myriad races took about two-thirds of their 720 marquises, around 500! It's said that some have broken through after years of battle!"

This was quite normal. If they hadn't died over so many years, breakthroughs were likely. The flow of time was different, but even if a hundred years passed here, it felt like a year there. Ten thousand years meant a thousand years had passed there. A thousand years, always fighting in the River of Time, the place closest to the rules of the great dao... if they didn't die, not becoming a ruler of laws would be a disgrace!

"Of the 500 marquises, how many have broken through? How many have died? It's hard to say... even if balance is maintained, with deaths and breakthroughs equal, the myriad races still have over a hundred rulers of laws!"

"And the human race, back then, had only about 40. The human race also took over 200 human marquises. Even if balance is maintained, the human race might have only forty to fifty human kings!"

"The gap between the two sides is at least half!"

"But because the human race has a super strong figure like the Human Emperor, they can still suppress and prevent the myriad races from daring to fight with all their might!"

Su Yu briefly introduced, even Xingyue hadn't mentioned the specific combat power. But roughly, it should be like this.

At this point, Su Yu added with a smile, "And one more thing, I must remind everyone, the Human Emperor is seriously injured. If we don't go, the myriad races won't dare to fight. If we go, the myriad races will definitely fight! At that time, the Human Emperor might as well not exist..."

"......"

Everyone was speechless. At this time, you're still playing this game?

Wan Tiansheng didn't pay attention to this and continued, "Then, Your Majesty, how much strength do you think we need to accumulate to qualify for rescue?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, "About 30 rulers of laws! I mean, those who can maintain the combat power of rulers of laws outside my world! I will solve this. I will ensure my world can sustain 30 rulers of laws with equivalent combat power, but... the numbers, you need to work hard to achieve!"

With that, Su Yu suddenly took out a list, "Those whose names I call, become rulers of laws as soon as possible! If you already are, strive to become three times stronger!"

"If someone outside the list becomes a ruler of laws..."

Su Yu smiled, "Then I will reward you, heavily! If those named fail to become rulers of laws before I leave..."

Su Yu's smile faded, "Then... the paths in my world are limited, make way!"

At these words, everyone felt a chill in their hearts!

Make way?

This... Wan Tiansheng immediately said urgently, "Your Majesty, is this appropriate?"

Su Yu was too harsh!

Becoming a ruler of laws isn't something that can be forced!

Su Yu said calmly, "The great daos in my world are open for you to comprehend, available to you. I've given you all the benefits I can. If you can't become a combat power that can be taken out to fight... then, why occupy the latrine without using it?"

"Rest assured, even if you make way, I will arrange for everyone. I won't let you fall after making way! This is my world, I can naturally arrange for everyone!"

"Of course, at that time, those people can retire!"

Su Yu said lightly, "Those who can fight will continue to fight, those who can't will retire. I, Su Yu, do not force you to follow me all the way to battle! The process of fighting is also a process of elimination!"

"Of course, fighting is dangerous, and death is common. When our opponents are a group of over a hundred rulers of laws, even I can't provide protection for everyone!"

"So, some people may not be unable to become rulers of laws, but may not dare to become!"

Su Yu sighed, "These people are also my comrades... but I don't force you, just retire in peace!"

Everyone was heavy-hearted.

Some were pondering the meaning behind Su Yu's words. Who was he referring to?

Who didn't dare to become a ruler of laws because they were afraid of death?

Everyone was judging, was it the Heavenly Kings or the Heavenly Venerables?

Only these people now had the opportunity to become rulers of laws.

The battle had reached this point, who was cowardly?

And Su Yu didn't name names. There were definitely some, but they hadn't shown it clearly yet, because as the battle continued, the enemies grew stronger, and some weariness and frustration were normal.

Su Yu didn't dwell on this, starting to call names, "Great Qin King, Great Xia King!"

At the start, it was these two commanders of the tenth tide.

Everyone was shocked. These two weren't considered old, were they both on the list of those who must become rulers of laws?

"Fat Ball, Tea Plant, Wan Tiansheng, Lantian, Great Ming King, Heavendoom, Wu Ji, March, Giant Bamboo, Doubao, September, Flatbread, Wuming, Tian Ce, Xuelan, Nanxi, Huoyun, Tianhuo, Lanshan, Lie Kong, Yingwu, Zhennan, Tongtian, Grandstar, Topsoil Spirit, Hou Pseudo Emperor, Space Ancient Emperor, Hetu."

Su Yu called out 30 names in one breath!

Exactly 30 people!

Su Yu looked at them, calmly saying, "30 people, some are Heavenly Venerables, some are Heavenly Kings! Even if they weren't Heavenly Kings before, with my several expansions of the world, they've reached the Heavenly King level!"

"For you, some I revived from the Celestial River of Death, some I helped comprehend the great dao, some came from Hundred Battle King's side... no matter which, whether I helped you replace the great dao or otherwise... I've paid a lot!"

Su Yu looked at them, "Among you 30, some may succeed, some may not advance, whether due to lack of talent or effort, if you can't break through before I go upstream... then make way!"

"You may not need to give up your entire dao, some can yield their dao for others!"

"My world has relatively singular daos, one dao may only accommodate one person... some occupy common daos but can't break through, forcing others to take unfamiliar paths, this is also a form of dao struggle... but occupying the latrine without using it, then you need to make way!"

Su Yu sighed, "It's not yet time to indulge. I don't want you all to occupy the Great Dao without striving for breakthroughs!"

Currently, he had quite a few rulers of laws under his command. If these individuals could all break through, the number of powerful figures under Su Yu would rapidly increase!

At this moment, someone below changed their expression and suddenly stepped forward, "Your Majesty... what about those of us not on the list?"

Su Yu looked at the person who had stepped forward and smiled, "Dingjun, why are you stirring up trouble?"

Marquis Dingjun's expression was quite a sight to behold!

I... damn you!

Among the six ancient marquises who survived that day, apart from those who had died, he was the only one not on Su Yu's list. This was truly a blow to his pride!

Marquis Dingjun gritted his teeth, "Your Majesty, have we been abandoned by you?"

He was displeased!

Heavendoom and the others remained silent this time because they were on the list.

This was somewhat reminiscent of Su Yu's King Sealing List, rather than a list of rulers of laws, which was infuriating!

Su Yu chuckled, "Not exactly. It's just that some of you, even if you've reached the Heavenly King level, lack deep comprehension of the Great Dao... I can still sense that!"

"Of course, if you can truly break through..."

Su Yu smiled, "As I said before, there are great rewards!"

Dingjun gritted his teeth and nodded, "Your Majesty, I will break through. I am already considered a Heavenly King now!"

Alright, you're a pseudo-Heavenly King. Su Yu nodded and said nothing more.

In the crowd, Xia Longwu suddenly stepped forward and asked in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, what are these great rewards you mentioned? It would give us more motivation!"

He wasn't on the list either because he was too young.

Even though he was progressing rapidly, Su Yu hadn't named him.

Su Yu looked at him and smiled. He had a high regard for Xia Longwu and treated him well. Hearing his question, Su Yu smiled, "King Sealing! I will bestow upon you the power of fortune within my world according to your rank! This way, everything will go smoothly for you in my world, your cultivation will accelerate, and your comprehension will deepen..."

Everyone's hearts stirred!

Su Yu continued, "Not only that, but there are other rewards!"

Su Yu smiled, "For example, after you become a ruler of laws, I will go to the Time Path and extract the corresponding power of the Great Dao to strengthen your Dao! This way, even among the rulers of laws, you won't be weak!"

"As for others... cultivate on your own!"

"Additionally, I will give you a page of the Mark of Civilization!"

At this moment, some were puzzled.

However, Wan Tiansheng and the others changed their expressions.

Su Yu calmly said, "The Mark of Civilization is the foundation of my Dao! The myriad Daos are also formed from my pages! As long as the pages are with me, it means I can always control you. Once you take the pages... it means this Dao is no longer under my control, and you can control it freely!"

Boom!

The entire hall erupted instantly.

This... was unbelievable!

Su Yu was relinquishing control over the Great Dao, which meant his control over them would plummet to its lowest point.

Yet Su Yu remained calm, "I am only targeting those not on the list because I know they have received little and gained little before. As for those on the list... we'll see in the future! If they can't become rulers of laws now, there won't be much opportunity later!"

At this, those not on the list looked at each other, suddenly feeling both crazed and excited!

If they could become rulers of laws, be crowned kings, share in the fortune, and control their own Dao, it would be an enormous opportunity!

No matter how much they admired Su Yu, they didn't want their Dao to be perpetually controlled by someone else.

If Su Yu truly lifted his restrictions on them... it would certainly ignite their motivation!

Above, Su Yu smiled.

Good!

In this way, perhaps one or two strong individuals might emerge from among them. If they could step into the realm of rulers of laws despite his low expectations, it would be a pleasant surprise.
