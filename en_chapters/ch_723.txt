Chapter 723: Surprise Attack, Slaughter, Encirclement

Nine days had passed.

At Bamboo Mountain.

Inside the grand bamboo hall, May looked at September with a sullen expression. "Nine days already!"

"Are you sure Su Yu is reliable? Where is he? Where did he go? Killing three Daofuse Realm experts isn't easy, but it's not impossible either. Has Su Yu given up?"

September, with a simple-minded look, replied, "It's only been nine days! Isn't there still one more day? Why the rush?"

May glanced at the darkening sky outside. "It's almost the tenth day!"

May was visibly displeased. "Ten days, and aside from some initial commotion, there's been no movement at all these past two days!"

Initially, Marquis Dingjun had appeared a few times, killing some people. But in the past few days, even Marquis Dingjun had vanished.

"No movement means they're preparing for something bigger," September said knowingly. He understood Su Yu. Since even Marquis Dingjun had disappeared, it was likely that Su Yu was preparing for something significant, gathering all his forces.

As they conversed, Marquis Giant Bamboo was leisurely eating, unconcerned with the conversation.

Nearby, April, seeing that the marquis wasn't saying anything, couldn't help but ask, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, if the ten-day deadline passes and they really haven't done anything... then what should we do?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo continued eating, his mouth greasy, and after a while, he burped contentedly. "The food at Bamboo Mountain is still the best. The food at the Source of the Dao is terrible!"

"......"

The Iron Devourer Race members all looked at him. Did he come back just for the food?

Marquis Giant Bamboo laughed heartily, "Why the rush? Isn't there still one more day? If nothing happens after ten days, then so be it!"

He shook his head, "If nothing happens, it doesn't mean they're foolish. If they kill three Daofuse Realm experts and get themselves killed, that would be truly foolish! Maybe they don't have enough confidence, or maybe they're waiting for the right moment... Let's wait and see! If they really can't do it, he has no reason to demand anything from our Iron Devourer Race. We'll act according to the situation!"

If Su Yu really didn't go to kill anyone, he didn't see anything wrong with that. If there's no certainty, forcing a kill and getting into trouble would be even more foolish.

He had given Su Yu ten days to kill three Daofuse Realm experts just to see the methods of this generation's Human Lord. If his methods weren't impressive... then they would just watch and see.

By now, the sky was pitch black.

Marquis Giant Bamboo yawned, "If there's no movement by tomorrow night, then let June and September continue to cooperate with him. As for the others... let's hold off on deepening cooperation for now!"

Since June and September were already cooperating, he wouldn't stop them or advise against it. However, he wasn't planning to hand over the remaining Iron Devourer Race experts to Su Yu. The risk was too great, and they could be wiped out at any moment.

Nearby, September mumbled, "Just wait and see! There's definitely no problem! Killing three Daofuse Realm experts isn't that hard. Su Yu must be planning something bigger."

...

On the outskirts of the Source of the Dao.

The tenth day had arrived.

The Great Ming King and Grandstar also emerged from the valley, their auras slightly stronger than before. However, to Su Yu, they seemed to have the strength of a fourth-tier Daofuse Realm at best. Their progress was decent, but Su Yu still found it lacking.

As everyone gathered, Su Yu transformed, donning a black robe that exuded a faint chaotic aura. It was weak, as the West King's Consort wasn't adept at the path of chaos, merely creating an illusion for others to see.

His aura gradually became indistinct.

A black robe covered his face!

Su Yu looked at the others and said in a deep voice, "Put on your black robes!"

Without a word, everyone quickly changed their attire. For powerful beings, their clothing was always a treasure, as ordinary clothes couldn't withstand their battles.

In an instant, all eleven of them were clad in black robes.

"Where do we come from?"

"Chaos Mountain!"

Su Yu asked, and they responded.

"What is our mission this time?"

"To unseal the Hundred Battle King!"

"Who is the leader of this mission?"

"Ziyan!"

Over the past few days, they had been mentally conditioning themselves, and now they answered smoothly.

The Mark of Civilization opened a blank page, and Su Yu looked at them, saying in a deep voice, "Enter!"

Lantian and the Great Zhou King, among others, entered with smiles.

The others exchanged glances and followed suit.

"The moment we emerge, our sole objective is to kill!"

"Understood!"

They responded in unison.

"Great Ming King, your task is heavier than the others!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "How long the formation can seal the aura will determine how long we can fight! If it seals for one minute, we can fight for three minutes. If it seals for three minutes, we have five minutes! If it's broken instantly, we must leave within two minutes, or else... I will abandon you and only take those I can. I won't stay for you!"

Everyone's expressions turned serious.

The Great Ming King breathed heavily, suddenly feeling immense pressure.

Although he had absorbed a lot of the power of laws in recent days, understanding the Dao wasn't something that could be achieved just by absorbing some power of laws.

The longer he could seal, the more time Su Yu and the others would have to kill!

The Great Ming King took a deep breath, his chest heaving. It had been a long time since he felt such a sense of crisis and mission.

Though not strong, this battle might determine the fate of all his comrades!

"Rest assured, Emperor Yu, I won't disgrace myself!"

The Great Ming King gritted his teeth, "Conservatively, three minutes. I'll strive to seal for five minutes!"

He didn't dare promise too much, as that would be irresponsible.

As long as he could seal for three minutes, Su Yu and the others would have five minutes to kill!

How many they could kill was uncertain.

Su Yu nodded slightly, and a page from the Mark of Civilization floated out. He handed it to the Great Ming King, "When your power is exhausted, draw from the power of the virtual dao within. This is the path of formations, matching you!"

He then took out some pages and distributed them to the others, varying from one to several pages each.

Su Yu looked at them, "These are the weapons I prepared for my own Dao confirmation. Now, I'm giving them to you. Don't lose them!"

"If your power is insufficient and the consumption is too great, draw from the power of laws!"

Everyone sensed the pages, each containing a substantial amount of the power of laws.

Finally, Su Yu, with utmost seriousness, looked at Marquis Dingjun and the others, saying in a deep voice, "The others have followed me through many battles. They will follow orders! As for you, I am not familiar with you. As a precaution, I don't want you to participate! In the lower realm, even if unfamiliar experts pledged allegiance to me, I would observe them for a long time!"

"Now, I don't have time to assess you!"

"Given the circumstances, I need your help, so I can only take you to battle!"

"This is a very risky endeavor, even more so than killing a Heavenly King, because I am biased against you. I am biased against those who survived the Ninth Tide. This is unavoidable!"

Su Yu said seriously, "Because the impression you give us is just that! Foolish! This is something you brought upon yourselves, not something I imposed on you. I don't know if you were truly foolish or if the situation was uncontrollable back then... In this battle, my only requirement of you is to follow orders!"

"Now, you are my subordinates. Whoever I order you to kill, you kill. Don't ask questions, don't doubt. On the battlefield, only I can issue orders!"

"Even if the Hundred Battle King is one step away from being unsealed, even if it's clear that one person can unseal him... if you dare to disobey my orders and act on your own, you will be executed without mercy!"

Su Yu warned repeatedly!

He was very worried!

Worried that these guys wouldn't listen, worried that at a critical moment, if they saw the Hundred Battle King about to be unsealed, they would abandon the battle to rescue him, leading to the entire war spiraling out of control.

Could this happen?

It was very likely!

Su Yu took another deep breath, "Don't think about what you believe. Don't think that once the Hundred Battle King is unsealed, we've won! Don't think that releasing the Hundred Battle King means he can kill three, five Heavenly Kings... Don't think about it! You don't need to consider these things. Your only task is to obey!"

Su Yu shouted, "Can you do it?"

The ancient marquises, overwhelmed by his aura, were somewhat intimidated.

Marquis Dingjun quickly said, "I will definitely follow orders. On the battlefield, there is only one voice. This was the military order everyone knew during the era of conquering the Myriad Realms!"

General Yingwu also said solemnly, "We were also generals who fought across the Myriad Realms in the past. We will not disobey orders on the battlefield."

Su Yu looked at each of them. Marquis Huoyun furrowed his brows but quickly nodded, "I will obey orders. I am also a commander. Rest assured, Human Lord!"

He then looked at Marquis Shadow.

Marquis Shadow said in a low voice, "I will follow orders."

Finally, he looked at Marquis Yunshui. Just as she was about to speak, Su Yu suddenly said in a deep voice, "Marquis Yunshui, you are the most thoughtful, and you are a smart person. I don't want you to do anything unwise! A woman's heart is the hardest to fathom! I don't care about anything else, but you must follow orders! Moreover, if Yingwu is in danger and about to die, without my command, you must not rescue him! The same goes for everyone else. No matter who is about to die, without my command, do not abandon your opponent to rescue them... even if it means death, hold your ground!"

"You've all lived for over a hundred thousand years. If you don't understand this... then leave!"

Marquis Yunshui showed a hint of bitterness for the first time and looked at Su Yu, "Human Lord... doesn't trust me?"

Su Yu silently looked at her.

Marquis Yunshui sighed, "I will follow orders. Rest assured, Human Lord."

She then added, "Human Lord has a bias against women... this is not right."

Nearby, General Yingwu raised an eyebrow. Really?

No, right?

Isn't Marquis Yunshui overthinking it?

I don't feel that way.

Marquis Yunshui said nothing more. Yingwu didn't feel it because... he wasn't seen as a woman.

Su Yu didn't bother to say anything else and directly sealed the Mark of Civilization.

Of course, he was biased. Who told you to always act so delicate and fragile, making me uneasy?

As for Yingwu... just treat him as a man. It's fine.

He had female generals under his command, but none of them looked delicate and fragile... or so it seemed.

Marquis Lanshan's first encounter was so fierce that it changed the color of the sky and earth. The South King, being a dominant figure and a necromancer, felt nothing unusual. As for Empyrean Cloud, there was no need to mention—he was always eager to kill, and if he didn't, Hanxiang would scold him daily. But Yunshui... Su Yu felt she might be a real woman, terrifying indeed. He needed to remind everyone to be cautious!

...

After gathering everyone into the Mark of Civilization, Su Yu didn't need to remind them. The Great Zhou King activated the "Silence" divine character to conceal part of their aura, while the Great Ming King set up a breath-concealing array within the pages. Su Yu also laid down some defensive and concealing forces outside the Mark of Civilization. When powerful beings were close to each other, their Great Daos could interfere, making it easy to be discovered. However, for Su Yu, with the Heaven Gate open, he could clearly discern whether he was near someone else's Great Dao, naturally avoiding such issues.

Soon, Su Yu transformed into a shadow, perfectly blending into the night. He pierced through the light screen and instantly entered the Source of the Dao.

...

Sealing Mountain.

To seal and guard Hundred Battle, the myriad races had exerted tremendous effort. Initially, only six pseudo-Dao Heavenly Kings were stationed here to maintain the seal. However, after the Control King's lineage attempted a rescue, two more powerful beings were added, stronger than the original six. The original six had to focus on sealing Hundred Battle. In the past, a top-tier Heavenly King might have had a chance to break in, but now, even one Heavenly King would be courting death. Not just one, even two or three would be seeking death. Four or five might stand a chance, but to deal with all eight would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens. With eight Heavenly Kings stationed, any disturbance would summon top-tier reinforcements within two minutes. If someone could truly take down the eight Heavenly Kings together, such a strong individual wouldn't need to sneak in for a rescue—they could just charge in directly!

At this moment, Sealing Mountain was as quiet as ever. The eight Heavenly Kings usually focused on their cultivation, rarely leaving their places. Six of them maintained fixed positions around Sealing Mountain for the seal, while the remaining two occasionally patrolled the area. Today, another Heavenly King began his routine patrol. A few days ago, Hundred Battle had a riot, and they were concerned it might continue.

The patrolling Heavenly King cultivated the True Dao, unlike the other Heavenly Kings. Compared to the others, who appeared aged and decrepit, he looked much younger and full of vitality, without any signs of decay. He walked through the air, causing waves of power of laws to surge. Soon, he flew to a platform halfway up the mountain. An old woman sat cross-legged on the platform. Sensing the disturbance, she opened her eyes and softly said, "Dao Yu, the frequency of your patrols has increased recently."

The young-looking man nodded slightly, "Hundred Battle rioted a few days ago. It hasn't happened in years. With the lower realm about to open, it's wise to be cautious."

The old woman chuckled softly, "The power of laws here is incredibly dense. Even the slightest disturbance can trigger a surge. Fewer patrols wouldn't hurt. Dao Yu, you should rest a bit and not worry too much."

Since Sealing Mountain was breached once, some measures had been put in place. For instance, the power of laws had become denser and more volatile. An Eternal entering would trigger a surge with the slightest fluctuation of their Great Dao. This served as the best warning array. For a Daofuse Realm cultivator, it was even more so. Unless they completely concealed their Great Dao, it was too easy to trigger the entire Sealing Mountain's surge.

Dao Yu laughed lightly, "No worries, I've been idle for too long. It's good to move around a bit!"

The old woman smiled and didn't persuade him further. The presence of eight quasi-kings was the greatest assurance. She envied Dao Yu, and softly said, "Indeed, Dao Yu, you can still be carefree. We can't. If we can't break through in a few hundred or thousand years, I'm afraid... our days are numbered!"

A sigh escaped her lips. Dao Yu was different from them. He cultivated the Great Dao's power from the past, a stable path. The others had captured new Daos later on to progress faster and become stronger. Initially, it wasn't an issue, but now, they could feel the difference. The newly captured Daos were more fragile and prone to decay compared to the original Great Dao's power.

Dao Yu comforted, "Friend Yulei, don't be too pessimistic. Once the lower realm opens and the human race is exterminated, cutting off all their paths, perhaps the rules of the Great Dao will be completely liberated!"

He smiled, "I heard from Marquis Yuan Sheng that the myriad races can't step into the realm of the rulers of laws, possibly due to the Human Emperor and others. Before they disappeared, they might have set some Great Dao rules... In short, once the human race is extinct, without them, perhaps all human rules will dissipate!"

This was what Marquis Yuan Sheng had told him, and he thought it was possible. Hearing this, the old woman felt a bit better, "Let's hope so!"

Looking at the mountain, she smiled, "This tide shouldn't have any more changes. Hundred Battle has been sealed for years. Even if the lower realm humans have talent, it's hard for them to reach the Daofuse Realm! Hundred Battle... is indeed a key figure!"

Dao Yu nodded with a smile, "That's why the myriad races haven't decided to kill him! Otherwise, we wouldn't need to seal him. If the myriad races' experts joined forces, even if Hundred Battle was formidable, he would be killed!"

No matter how strong, there was a limit. Three or five Heavenly Kings couldn't kill him? Then ten! Ten not enough? There were top-tier quasi-kings close to the realm of the rulers of laws. Bring a few more, would that be enough? Killing him was definitely possible. The key was that the myriad races relied on Hundred Battle to seal the human race for six thousand years, preventing them from reaching the Daofuse Realm.

The old woman smiled, seeing Dao Yu in a talkative mood, and asked, "There were some changes in the lower realm recently. Do you know what happened? It seems that friends like Meteor and Demon Turmoil have fallen."

Dao Yu nodded slightly, speaking softly, "It seems a new Human Lord has emerged in the lower realm. According to some previous intelligence, it seems related to that old turtle, Hongmeng."

"Hongmeng..."

The old woman frowned but soon smiled, "He's lived for so long, but wasn't he uninvolved in these matters? Has he gotten involved now?"

"Who knows."

Dao Yu laughed, "Perhaps everyone feels that this tide has reached its final moment! It's normal to take a gamble or fight for it! If the lower realm humans truly gather their strength, they still have some power. That Doubao of the God Devourer Race, along with Hongmeng, are top-tier Daofuse cultivators! If those races make some moves... those like June of the Iron Devourer Race are remnants!"

The old woman chuckled, "If not for March still being alive, along with Giant Bamboo, the Iron Devourer Race should have been exterminated long ago!"

Dao Yu nodded. That was true. However, the existence of March still made some top-tier beings wary. Before exterminating the human race, they didn't want to deal with March first, fearing excessive losses. Some secrets were secrets to others, but not to these top-tier beings. The fact that March was alive was known to almost all Heavenly Kings.

The old woman continued, "Immortal Battle recently competed with Blood Severance for a Dao. It seems Immortal Battle won. Doesn't he know that an unowned Dao is extremely dangerous? I heard he wants to switch Daos for cultivation?"

"Can't resist the temptation."

Dao Yu, also from the Immortal Race, knew some details and laughed, "Can't blame him for being tempted. Immortal Battle has been around for so many years and only recently advanced to quasi-king. But the newly acquired Dao is not simple!"

"Not simple?"

"Of course, otherwise Blood Severance wouldn't have fought him so fiercely."

Dao Yu laughed, "Even I'm a bit envious. The Dao Immortal Battle seized should be the Physical Dao!"

The old woman was surprised. Dao Yu nodded, "Yes, the Physical Dao! You know, the Physical Dao of various races is actually a top-tier Great Dao! Whether it's the human race, the Immortal Race, or the Demon Race... the Physical Dao is a top-tier strong Dao for each race!"

"In the Upper Realm, although there are many Great Dao rules, and new ones appear from time to time, such foundational top-tier Great Daos are extremely rare."

The old woman was envious, "Indeed, if it's the Physical Dao... it's worth switching Daos. No wonder Blood Severance was relentless, fighting Immortal Battle for years."

Dao Yu laughed, "If I could seize some foundational Daos, like the Five Elemental Dao or the Dao of Life, I'd want to switch too! Especially the Dao of Life, but unfortunately, it has never appeared."

"If you could seize the Dao of Life... you'd truly have hope to advance further..."

They chatted for a while. Dao Yu smiled, "I'll go check elsewhere."

"Take care, Dao Yu!"

They bid farewell, and Dao Yu continued his patrol.

...

At the edge of Sealing Mountain, Su Yu silently observed. With the Heaven Gate open, he surveyed the area and smiled. Quite a method! The power of laws here was so unstable, easily triggering a surge. However... didn't they know that the power of laws in the Source of the Dao belonged to him?

The small stone in his hand vanished instantly. Ahead, a turbulent power of laws was instantly suppressed into tranquility by Su Yu. This power of laws originated from the Human Emperor's Great Dao. The small stone was the manifestation of the Human Emperor's will. Could it not suppress them?

Su Yu looked around, seeing a Great Dao's power moving around, causing some disturbances. He pursed his lips. Why do you keep running around? But this guy was not easy to deal with. A True Dao expert! Perhaps to others, True Dao and False Dao were the same, but to Su Yu, False Dao was easy to handle, while True Dao was genuinely difficult, representing real combat power.

"Maybe I can launch a surprise attack, take down one first, and ease their pressure..."

Silently, Su Yu continued to move towards the direction where the old woman had been. There was no other reason; the moving guy had just stayed there for a while and wouldn't return soon.

Su Yu transformed into a speck of dust, swiftly drifting behind Little Stone, heading towards the mountainside. Little Stone led the way!

"If we kill one, and the others escape... that would be troublesome!" Su Yu mused. "But if they do run... it's not all bad. Less pressure, and we can quickly flee after the kill. If one or two manage to escape, let them. The six sealing Hundred Battle King won't be able to run easily; their power of laws is still in the seal. If anyone escapes, it will be those two Daofuse experts!"

This time, Su Yu's target was those six. As for the two Daofuse experts, if they escape, so be it. The hope of killing them wasn't high.

Gradually, he closed in on the powerful figure at the mountainside, the distance between them shrinking.

The mountain was vast! From the foot to the mountainside, it spanned tens of thousands of meters. Yet, the gap between them was closing.

5,000 meters, 3,000 meters...

Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate, observing the movements of the power of laws. With the Heaven Gate open, everything was laid bare. Whether the opponent had discovered him or was pretending not to notice, he could discern from the fluctuations of the power of laws.

The opponent's power of laws remained stable, indicating they hadn't noticed anything.

With the Heaven Gate, it was terrifying. As long as you weren't vigilant, thinking no one could see your power of laws, your thoughts and intentions would be completely exposed.

"They haven't discovered me!" Su Yu breathed a sigh of relief.

At this moment, he could even see the old woman on the mountainside.

"A member of the Spirit Race?" Su Yu was surprised. This was the first time he had encountered a top expert from the Spirit Race. Finally, he had a chance to kill one of them!

2,000 meters!

Su Yu drew closer.

1,000 meters!

This was an incredibly short distance. For a Daofuse expert, having someone approach within a kilometer was almost like having them right in your face.

...

On the mountainside platform, the old woman suddenly opened her eyes, feeling a bit uneasy. She glanced down, frowning slightly.

No movement!

She quickly scanned the surroundings. In the distance, the power of laws was still in turmoil. That was Daoyu still patrolling, not too far from her. He had just checked this area.

Eight Heavenly Kings were nearby, all within a few seconds' reach.

"What's wrong with me?" she wondered.

Was she overthinking?

The old woman thought to herself. She had just advised Daoyu not to worry too much, yet here she was, feeling anxious. It was peculiar.

"Brother Daoyu!" the old woman suddenly called out. Below, Su Yu almost thought he had been discovered and was ready to act. But seeing the old woman's power of laws still stable, without any defensive intent, he relaxed again.

Wait a bit longer!

Wait for Daoyu to move further away before making a move.

"Friend Yulei, is something the matter?" Daoyu turned back, looking over with a smile.

The old woman thought for a moment and said, "Nothing, just remembered the other day, we talked about convening the Myriad Race Council. Do you know when it will start?"

"Probably in a month or so," Daoyu replied with a laugh from afar. "Very soon, but we probably won't be able to participate. Our task here is quite important."

"That's true," the old woman nodded slightly, chatting with Daoyu for a bit. Her earlier unease diminished significantly.

Scaring herself!

This place was heavily guarded, with Daoyu nearby. What was she thinking?

In the distance, Daoyu also smiled, turning to fly in another direction.

"Strike hard!"

At that moment, within the Mark of Civilization, Lantian and the others heard Su Yu's voice.

Strike hard!

Su Yu wasn't planning to suppress the old woman now. Otherwise, if the other pseudo-Dao experts were scared off, it would be troublesome.

A Heavenly King with most of their power suppressing Hundred Battle King, with Su Yu and Lantian here, was much stronger than when they killed Blood Dragon Marquis last time. Could they not kill this old woman?

Before the words even finished, the Mark of Civilization opened. Along with Su Yu, a total of eleven experts appeared instantly.

The power of laws exploded with a thunderous roar!

Eleven black-clad, black-robed experts, all going all out, with no intention of holding back.

Marquis Dingjun and the others even began burning their blood essence.

Such immense power, gathered together, erupted instantly!

On the mountainside, the old woman had just finished chatting with Daoyu, just settled down for a moment, when suddenly, her heart nearly leapt out of her chest.

She was stunned.

Danger!

Extreme danger!

A life-threatening crisis!

The last time she felt such a crisis, she couldn't even remember how many years ago it was.

"Dan—"

The old woman couldn't even finish her word, wanting to warn, but it was too late!

Someone had gotten close to her!

She hadn't even noticed!

At that moment, the Great Ming King also threw out a formation, instantly sealing the entire Sealing Mountain. The formation wasn't strong, but it was enough to block the battle aura from leaking out.

All parties reacted quickly, moving at incredible speed.

They were all top experts.

Without any hesitation, they swiftly flew towards the old woman. Daoyu, the fastest and closest, had just turned his head. Sensing the turmoil, he immediately turned back, flying towards the old woman.

In two or three seconds, he could definitely reach her!

However, could the old woman hold on for two or three seconds?

Clearly not!

With Su Yu close by, multiple top existences attacking together, the old woman was completely unprepared. Her power of laws was still suppressing Hundred Battle King. At most, she was comparable to a second-tier Daofuse expert. How could she match so many strong existences?

Boom!

A deafening explosion shook the heavens and earth!

The entire Sealing Mountain instantly erupted into a massive cloud!

The power of laws didn't even have time to explode. The old woman, still in a meditative posture, was directly blown apart by the combined attack of Su Yu and the others!

Her Sea of Will just appeared, only to be shattered by the aftermath, blown to pieces!

Dead!

Fallen so swiftly it was unbelievable!

Halfway across the distance, Daoyu's face changed. The next moment, he roared in fury, "Bastards, kill them!"

Damn it!

He had just been patrolling, just left that area, and in the blink of an eye, this friend Yulei had fallen!

Two quasi-King auras, the rest were not quasi-Kings!

Daoyu quickly assessed the enemy's strength. They could be matched, they could be killed!

"Blood Demon, come quickly!" Daoyu shouted, calling for another Daofuse expert to come and kill the enemy.

Someone had gotten so close, it was terrifying!

At this moment, Su Yu said nothing, looking at Lantian, quickly saying, "Daoyu, he's mine!"

Lantian understood, the other one was his!

The two soared into the sky, moving at incredible speed!

In the blink of an eye, they charged towards Daoyu!

On the other side, the Great Zhou King shouted, "Follow me!"

The group didn't scatter but moved at the fastest speed towards another pseudo-Dao expert!

They had to be quick!

...

Boom!

A second later, another loud explosion echoed. Su Yu and Daoyu, two experts with the character "Yu" in their names, collided in an instant.

Lantian brushed past, rushing towards the approaching Blood Demon!

"Who are you?" Daoyu shouted angrily.

Such audacity, two quasi-Kings daring to attack the Sealing Mountain, were they mad?

Further away, a decaying old man shouted, "Quickly kill them, with Yulei dead, Hundred Battle King will sense it, the seal will loosen!"

Hearing this, Daoyu's expression changed!

"So that's your plan!"

He almost let anger cloud his judgment. Yes, with Yulei dead, Hundred Battle King would sense it.

No wonder two quasi-Kings dared to come. They knew the six of them were sealing Hundred Battle King. If one died, it would cause Hundred Battle King to struggle, right?

No wonder two quasi-Kings came separately to deal with him and Blood Demon!

The enemy knew their situation well, knew who was involved in the seal and who wasn't.

They had detailed intelligence!

Was it leaked information, or did the expert who came last time record this information and pass it on?

Were these people in cahoots with that guy from last time?

The Chaos Race!

At this moment, he also sensed the faint chaotic power on Su Yu and Lantian.

Two quasi-Kings, both had some chaotic power.

"So it's you, the Chaos Race!" Daoyu instantly understood, shouting, "Kill!"

Boom!

Su Yu also quickly punched, launching an attack!

The two clashed instantly. Su Yu, having just entered this realm and not using the pen dao, was immediately suppressed, forced to retreat continuously!

"A newly advanced guy!" Daoyu shouted coldly, "You're courting death!"

From behind, another explosion sounded, followed by a cold laugh, "This one over here seems newly advanced too. Daoyu, hurry up, let's see who kills the other first!"

Boom!

The sound of explosions reverberated!

On the Great Zhou King's side, the group also engaged a pseudo-Dao expert, erupting into battle in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, the other four pseudo-Dao Heavenly Kings quickly rushed over!

Three headed towards the Great Zhou King's group, one was about to soar into the sky to kill the Great Ming King, who was controlling the formation!

In the sky, the Great Ming King slightly changed color.

But Su Yu didn't care, quickly retreating, observing the power of laws.

Sure enough, at that moment, the Sealing Mountain trembled!

A frenzied roar echoed!

"I can feel it, one of those beasts is dead, hahaha... someone has come to save me!"

Hundred Battle King!

He sensed it, felt the loosening of the seal. One of the existences sealing him was dead!

Boom!

The mountain shook violently. The one heading to kill the Great Ming King changed expression, gritting his teeth, his aura exploding, instantly increasing the suppression force. The other pseudo-Dao experts did the same!

They all unleashed more power to suppress Hundred Battle King!

Damn it, the guy was struggling again!

Despite unleashing more power, that Heavenly King, possessing second-tier Daofuse combat strength, took a breath and flew towards the Great Ming King again!

First, kill the one controlling the formation!

This formation, the pseudo-Dao Heavenly King was familiar with. Back then, someone who came to rescue had set up this formation.

Of course, that person back then was much stronger than the one today!

Break the formation first. Once the formation breaks, the outside world will quickly sense the battle here!

As he approached, Su Yu, who was retreating, didn't hesitate. The bottom page of the Mark of Civilization shot out!

He still hadn't suppressed the power of laws!

Because the other four Heavenly Kings hadn't been surrounded yet!

Only when they were surrounded would Su Yu suppress them!

Year 740 of the Anping Calendar.

In the distance, the four Heavenly Kings gathered. Even though they were somewhat restrained by the Hundred Battle King, their combined might was overwhelming. In the blink of an eye, they forced the Great Zhou King and his allies into retreat. Despite their formidable strength, the likes of Grandstar and Chongming were still too weak, being relentlessly suppressed by a single Heavenly King.

...

High above, a Heavenly King poised to strike down the Great Ming King noticed Su Yu tossing out a golden page, causing him to frown slightly. He couldn't underestimate the means of a Human Lord. However, Su Yu was being suppressed by Daoyu, and if he thought he could rely on a weapon to deal with him, he was merely dreaming!

With a punch, he aimed to shatter the golden page first!

Below, the Hundred Battle King struggled fiercely, roaring with madness. He sensed someone coming to his rescue, even detecting some familiar auras!

"Dingjun, Huoyun, is that you?"

"Hahaha!"

The Hundred Battle King's wild laughter echoed—it was the Human Race, seemingly his subordinates! They had all come!

At this moment, the bottom page of the Mark of Civilization opened.

Marquis Zhennan flew out instantly, hearing the Hundred Battle King's voice, feeling both excited and trembling!

It was true!

The new Human Lord had truly brought them to the Sealed Mountain!

In that moment, he felt like shouting, like rushing forward to help the Hundred Battle King break free from his seal, but he remembered Su Yu's words.

Gritting his teeth, Marquis Zhennan remained silent.

His body exploded!

The Heavenly King across from him sensed his presence, recognizing him the moment he appeared.

Marquis Zhennan!

A top-tier Daofuse cultivator!

His strength was comparable to the Heavenly King's current level, as the latter had expended much energy suppressing the Hundred Battle King.

He even considered that dealing with Marquis Zhennan might leave him unable to kill the one setting up the formation or participate in other battles, as Marquis Zhennan was no weakling.

They might end up fighting for a long time!

That was his thought.

However... the next moment, his eyes widened!

Boom!

A deafening explosion resounded as Marquis Zhennan... self-destructed!

A top-tier Daofuse cultivator, just out, without a word, even sensing that the opposing quasi-king was on par with him, capable of battle, yet Marquis Zhennan chose to self-destruct!

He had promised!

And Su Yu had fulfilled his promise, bringing him here, even hearing the Hundred Battle King's roar.

Since that was the case... he was willing to keep his word this once.

Boom!

The explosion echoed through the heavens and earth, the Heavenly King directly blasted into pieces, utterly stunned.

Why?

My strength has declined, and in a fight with you, I might not win, but we could still battle!

You... self-destructed?

Why!

He couldn't comprehend it.

Reaching this level of cultivation wasn't easy for Marquis Zhennan, and yet he chose to self-destruct?

Not only him, everyone was momentarily stunned.

Marquis Dingjun and the others' expressions changed!

The struggling Hundred Battle King, even his shadow projected out, trembling, and the next moment, he roared, "Marquis Zhennan!"

What happened?

Why did Marquis Zhennan self-destruct?

At this moment, everyone was shocked, except for Su Yu, who showed no surprise, wasting no time. As Marquis Zhennan self-destructed, Su Yu quickly retreated, traversing the void, striking with a palm!

The Heavenly King, whose body was blasted apart, had his sea of consciousness just revealed, shattered by Su Yu's palm!

A dense power of laws instantly erupted!

And Su Yu, with a flash of the golden page from the Mark of Civilization, collected Marquis Zhennan's soon-to-shatter sea of consciousness!

He only asked him to self-destruct his body, not necessarily die.

The task was complete!

Marquis Zhennan had fulfilled his mission.

The second Heavenly King had fallen!

Daoyu arrived a step later, his expression changing!

"So ruthless!"

These people, so ruthless!

Marquis Zhennan had roamed the Upper Realm for thousands of years without being killed, yet here he self-destructed!

These people were all mad!

What kind of person could organize such a force?

Such suicidal attacks!

But Su Yu remained calm, ignoring the furious Hundred Battle King. Two were dead, and the Hundred Battle King's seal was loosening. Shouldn't he struggle more, help me restrain those four Heavenly Kings?

Su Yu was unceremonious, directly shouting, "Hundred Battle, struggle!"

The Hundred Battle King was stunned, called by name...

Alright, he didn't think much.

Yes, struggle!

Break the seal!

Boom!

The violent sound shook the entire mountain. He wanted to break the seal, to burst out and kill these bastards!

Rumble!

The four Heavenly Kings battling the Great Zhou King and his allies felt immense pressure!

"Quick, suppress him!"

"Daoyu, Blood Demon, hurry and kill them!"

"..."

The four Heavenly Kings roared in anger, quick!

The Hundred Battle King restrained them, and the Great Zhou King's side wasn't weak either. At this moment, both sides were evenly matched!

But once the Hundred Battle King broke the seal, that would be the most dangerous moment!

And Su Yu, quickly looking over there, raised an eyebrow slightly.

Almost there!

The Great Zhou King and his allies were about to complete their encirclement!

Very good, everything is under my control!
