Chapter 708: The Power of Chaos

(After half an hour of opening the Heaven Gate)

Xia Longwu and his group had just left when Su Yu also departed from Dao Origin Mountain. Dao Origin Mountain was one of the smallest peaks in the vicinity, with several other towering mountains nearby, each over ten thousand meters high. Yet, these were merely the outskirts.

Su Yu headed to the nearest ten-thousand-meter peak from Dao Origin Mountain. With his Heaven Gate open, he could see powerful beings within the mountain, all connected to the chaotic power of the area. Their projections were invisible to ordinary people, but Su Yu could see them clearly.

The mountain he chose seemed to house a giant beast with two large tusks. Su Yu wasn't familiar with its exact name. Its most distinctive feature was its two tusks, extremely sharp and somewhat resembling those of an elephant, though straighter.

...

Before long, Su Yu arrived near the towering mountain. He observed from a distance. There were no other ancient beasts on the mountain, but some peaks without projections might house weaker ancient beasts. The presence of projections indicated the likelihood of Daofuse Realm beings. With such powerful entities around, ordinary ancient beasts dared not approach.

After further observation, Su Yu noticed a gray pillar of light at the mountain's summit. Upon closer inspection, it was actually a stream formed by the absorption of chaotic power.

"Living atop the mountain, it seems, is to more conveniently absorb this chaotic power."

Su Yu scrutinized the scene and finally spotted the giant beast. It was at the summit! Its body was enormous, and its aura was incredibly formidable. Unlike ordinary cultivators who harness the power of the Great Dao, this beast was filled with chaotic power.

"Ancient beast... Great Dao... River of Time... Chaotic power..."

Su Yu observed closely. This giant tusked beast wasn't cultivating a conventional Great Dao; it seemed to be merely strengthening its physical body. Could this be considered an alternative path of body cultivation?

"How does this chaotic power-based body cultivation compare to the human path of body cultivation? What are the differences and advantages?"

Su Yu pondered, trying to discern the distinctions. The Desolate Beast also cultivated the path of the body but was connected to the River of Time. This giant tusked beast, however, seemed unconnected. Why, then, did the Desolate Beast connect to the River of Time?

Questions arose in Su Yu's mind. Coming to the Upper Realm, the greatest mystery lay in Chaos Mountain, and the greatest gain was also here. Though he had only just arrived, Su Yu felt he was experiencing a different system altogether.

Not following the path of the River of Time!

For Su Yu, this was an extremely important realization.

Su Yu continued to think, refraining from approaching. He needed to observe the situation before making any decisions.

...

At the mountain's summit, the giant tusked beast lay asleep, still absorbing the chaotic power. Its two massive tusks gleamed with a cold light. At this moment, the tusks flickered slightly. Suddenly, the beast's enormous eyes opened a tiny slit. In the next instant, one of the giant tusks shot out!

It shattered the void!

Piercing through space!

In an instant, it shot towards the outside of the giant mountain.

...

Boom!

A loud noise erupted. Su Yu first dodged, realizing he couldn't evade it, and threw a punch. He didn't use the power of the Great Dao, relying solely on his physical strength. As he punched, Su Yu quickly retreated, his heart filled with shock.

Such keen intuition!

Here, some of his concealment abilities were greatly diminished. Moreover, because he wielded the power of the Great Dao, he stood out in this place. Su Yu dared not expose his pen dao power, so he only used his physical strength to engage the opponent.

Boom!

Thud!

The massive tusk was halted momentarily by Su Yu's punch, but it didn't stop. In the blink of an eye, it came at him again, piercing through Su Yu's arm.

Su Yu let out a low shout, pointing with a pen. With a swish, the tusk was knocked away. In a flash, he fled.

If he went all out, this giant tusked beast probably wouldn't be his match. However, the moment Su Yu used his pen dao, he clearly felt some projections on nearby peaks tremble. Evidently, these ancient beasts sensed an intruder.

If Su Yu continued to fight using the pen dao, even if he killed the giant tusked beast, he would face more attacks from ancient beasts.

...

A few minutes later, Su Yu concealed his aura once more, hiding in a valley, his expression not looking good.

Such sharp instincts!

The giant tusked beast might not have discovered him, but it instinctively sensed danger nearby or someone spying on it. Without hesitation, it attacked with a tusk.

"Such sharp tusks. Judging purely by destructive power, it probably has the killing power of a fifth-tier Daofuse."

"And that's just one tusk. Even if it's a core part of the beast, the entire giant tusked beast might have the power of a fourth or even third-tier Daofuse!"

The third-tier standard includes some of the older generation of ancient marquises, like Marquis Falling Star, Marquis Dingjun, and Marquis Modang. The fourth tier would be the strength of old Daofuse experts like the Ape Emperor from the lower realm. The fifth tier is the normal Daofuse combat strength. The sixth tier consists of the weaker Daofuse, either newly advanced or those who advanced through the Three Body Method, both quite weak.

Just an outer beast, yet possessing third or fourth-tier Daofuse strength, was indeed terrifying.

"However, these beasts have lived for so long, slowly grinding their way to this level of strength. It's not surprising."

Many of the beasts in Chaos Mountain were from ancient or even primordial times. Having such strength wasn't unexpected.

Su Yu looked at his arm, which had been pierced by the tusk, the bone broken. The tusk was so large it nearly severed his arm. In terms of physical strength, Su Yu surpassed many Daofuse experts, but compared to these chaotic path experts who solely cultivated their bodies, there was still a significant gap.

"Chaotic power also carries some corrosive force."

Su Yu carefully felt the chaotic power refined by the beast, which clung to his wound. He felt its destructive nature more acutely, containing various destructive forces.

"It even has a hint of death energy!"

Su Yu sensed it carefully, nodding slightly after a while. Indeed, there was a hint of death energy.

This was intriguing—chaos inherently carrying death energy. As expected, myriad paths encompass the path of death. The death energy path of the Celestial River of Death should fundamentally originate from the myriad paths, all stemming from the same source, akin to the River of Time.

"New neighbors aren't very friendly."

Su Yu shook his head. To deceive them, one must first meet and talk. Encountering those who don't talk and attack on sight is quite troublesome.

This truly echoed Bai Feng's words: no matter how persuasive you are, if someone ignores you and punches you, you'll still suffer.

"Indeed, the best way to deal with tricksters and swindlers is to ignore them and hit them directly!"

Su Yu chuckled at himself. Soon, he laughed, "They discovered me, sensed me, targeted me, probably all because of the pen dao. Even if I shielded it, there's still a trace of the Great Dao."

"I need the kind of grand formation from the Control King's lineage to completely shield such fluctuations and unleash my full strength without worrying about being sensed by other ancient beasts and targeted."

"Or I could simply cultivate the path of chaos."

Su Yu pondered. The Mark of Civilization actually had the implication of reopening chaos. Perhaps he could now cultivate a virtual path of chaos.

"The power of myriad paths mixed together is the path of chaos."

"Sorting them out creates the myriad paths."

"Blue Sky might be able to try mixing the myriad paths. If it works for him, I can attempt it too..."

Thinking of this, Su Yu suddenly called out, "Blue Sky?"

He tentatively called out. Did Blue Sky follow him out?

To be honest, without using the power of the Great Dao, Su Yu found it hard to detect him. Of course, with the Heaven Gate open, if Blue Sky used the power of the Great Dao, Su Yu could detect him. But Blue Sky wasn't foolish; he was unlikely to use the power of the Great Dao here.

"Blue Sky?"

Su Yu called again. No one responded, so Su Yu laughed, "Come out and chat!"

After speaking, a small stone less than a thousand meters away suddenly revealed two eyes. Blue Sky spoke honestly, "Emperor Yu, why are you calling me?"

"......"

Su Yu looked at the stone, a curse on the tip of his tongue. You really are here! I was just testing.

The stone grew two legs and quickly ran towards Su Yu. Its aura was weak, extremely faint, with two eyes. It ran to Su Yu and spoke honestly, "Emperor Yu, what's the matter?"

Su Yu was helpless, smiling wryly as he said, "You really made a clone?"

A stone clone? Impressive!

"Just trying it out. This place is quite resistant to the Great Dao. I'm comprehending this chaotic power, and having many clones to comprehend is better than doing it alone."

Alright, you win.

Su Yu laughed, "Can your Path of All Beings accommodate this chaotic power?"

The stone Blue Sky replied honestly, "Not yet. The so-called path of chaos is just the myriad paths mixed together. My path is actually sorted from the myriad paths. To turn it into a path of chaos, I would first have to make my Great Dao power chaotic, which could lead to conflicts and cause the clone to explode..."

Blue Sky explained briefly, then quickly added, "This requires adjustment. The path of chaos should also be composed of different proportions. Emperor Yu can open the Heaven Gate to analyze the proportions of various Dao powers and how they mix to form a power similar to chaotic power!"

The stone Blue Sky said honestly, "All the Great Daos in the world, no matter how they change, originate from chaos, so naturally, they can return to chaos!"

Su Yu pondered, nodding, "You're right."

Blue Sky continued, "Chaotic power isn't necessarily good. Emperor Yu shouldn't think this path is strong! The predecessors sorted out the power of the Great Dao for a reason. The sorted Great Dao power can always return to chaos, but chaos cannot always be sorted into the power of the myriad paths."

Blue Sky chuckled, "The so-called chaos is actually a lack of deep understanding of the Great Dao, unable to sort it. These beasts may seem strong, but their intelligence is low, relying on time to grind their strength."

Su Yu nodded again.

Lantian continued, "Of course, in my understanding, this is actually a process. From chaos, to sorting out the myriad daos, and then returning the myriad daos to chaos, ultimately returning to chaos is a powerful process. However, if you skip the process of sorting out the myriad daos, it means you still don't understand the dao."

Su Yu nodded again, smiling, "Lantian, you truly have a deep understanding of the dao."

Su Yu naturally understood Lantian's words. To return the myriad daos to their origin and transform them back into the chaotic dao—that's a skill! Simply using the power of chaos without understanding is just brute force. Only using the power of the myriad daos without understanding others is being too specialized, limiting oneself to what is familiar.

"Analyzing the composition of chaotic power..." Su Yu sighed with some regret, "I'm not particularly skilled at this, but now it seems I have to do it. Lantian, you come from a background of transformation studies, so you should understand this research, right?"

"Of course!" Lantian, in his stone form, chuckled, "I've actually been researching the composition these past few days, but even if I figure it out, I can only use it myself. Emperor Yu, can you handle it?"

"Of course!" Su Yu laughed, then thought for a moment and said, "Let's first see who our neighbors are. After that, we'll go back and study. I'll use the Mark of Civilization to sketch out a fake chaotic dao first!"

He planned to create a new page to temporarily store the fake chaotic dao. It would be best to kill a weaker ancient beast and analyze it in detail. Perhaps even use the Mark of Civilization to devour it and comprehend the beast's memories. Killing a powerful Daofuse Realm beast would cause too much commotion, but killing a Sunmoon or Eternal beast shouldn't be a problem, right? With Su Yu's strength, even without using the power of the dao, an ordinary ninth-stage Eternal would still have to kneel before him.

At this moment, Su Yu felt a bit regretful. It was a pity that his teacher Bai Feng and the others were too weak, with shallow understanding of the dao. Otherwise, if he left this task to them, they would quickly analyze everything clearly, identifying the various powers of the dao involved. Specialization is key; Su Yu was strong and versatile, but he wasn't proficient in everything.

Analyzing the composition was something he could do, but it would take some time.

...

Soon, Su Yu continued to explore the surrounding neighbors. In the outer area, within a thousand miles radius of Dao Origin Mountain, he discovered 77 peaks, three chaotic rivers, and a stretch of primeval forest. Among the 77 peaks, 22 had Daofuse Realm beasts. It wasn't as many as he imagined, but it was more than he expected, representing 22 Daofuse Realm beasts, which was terrifying.

This place was indeed a dangerous land, perhaps the most dangerous in the entire Upper Realm. Even if the myriad races conquered the Upper Realm, they wouldn't dare venture into Chaos Mountain.

"However... the beasts of Chaos Mountain also dare not leave it recklessly."

In Chaos Mountain, these beasts had the advantage, but Su Yu observed that once they left Chaos Mountain, they might be suppressed. If they went to the Lower Realm, where the power of the River of Time was most prosperous, these beasts would likely have no space to survive, as the chaotic power would be completely suppressed.

"Indeed, the absence of wild beasts in the Lower Realm makes sense; it's not suitable for their survival unless these beasts, like the Desolate Beasts, connect their dao to the River of Time..."

By now, Su Yu had a deeper understanding of these matters. The Desolate Beasts' dao connected to the River of Time, indicating that they possessed considerable intelligence. Within the coverage of the River of Time, if they didn't open the path of the flesh, they would be severely suppressed. Continuing on the path of ancient beasts would greatly weaken their strength. When in the myriad realms, they must follow the rules of the myriad realms. And the rules of the myriad realms were dictated by the River of Time.

"If the River of Time is a dao, then the master of this dao has turned the myriad realms into their domain, organizing the entire dao. Any chaotic creature entering the myriad realms must abide by their myriad dao rules!"

The more Su Yu thought about it, the more he realized the terrifying nature of the River of Time.

...

This exploration took Su Yu three days. He was injured a few times, but there was no major crisis. The outer peaks had many Daofuse Realm beasts, but they were mostly third or fourth class, with few second class. At this point, it had only been five days since Su Yu arrived in the Upper Realm. Sharpening the axe does not delay the work of chopping firewood; Su Yu felt that these three days were well spent.

...

Dao Origin Mountain.

Su Yu returned. Marquis Dingjun was anxious. As soon as Su Yu returned, he hurriedly asked, "Emperor Yu, it's been three days. Should we contact Marquis Shadow? He has sent another invitation for a meeting..."

"No rush!"

Marquis Dingjun was helpless. Not in a rush? What was this person planning?

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to explain. He quickly said, "Great Zhou King, Lantian, call up the Great Ming King. Let's do some research together, study the composition of chaotic power."

The Daofuse Realm experts here included Jiuyue, Grandstar, and Marquis Dingjun. Su Yu didn't call these three; they weren't suited for research.

Under the bewildered gazes of Marquis Dingjun and the others, the Great Ming King soon arrived from the formation base. Hearing Su Yu's words, they all showed interest. They were all cultural researchers! Yes, cultural researchers often engaged in some form of research. Studying the composition of chaotic power was both interesting and meaningful.

In the cave, Jiuyue and the other two sat like fools on the side, while in the center, Su Yu and the others were busy researching the composition of chaotic power.

...

At this moment, the old schemer Great Zhou King also showed his true skills. One divine character after another appeared: "Disassemble," "Separate," "Divide," "Merge," "Transform," various divine characters emerged, disassembling the chaotic power.

As he disassembled, Great Zhou King spoke, "In fact, some ancient powerhouses also researched chaotic power. If I remember correctly, the Human Emperor, Culture King, Control King, and Radiant King all studied it."

Grandstar, watching the spectacle, laughed, "What about the Martial King?"

"That brute doesn't understand these things..." Great Zhou King said, quickly realizing his slip, and coughed, "Ahem, what I mean is, the Martial King wasn't interested in these matters."

He tried to maintain the Martial King's dignity.

Lantian, with many avatars, each studying different powers of the dao, laughed simultaneously, "Why hide it? The Martial King is just a brute. What's wrong with saying that? Without support, he's just the second generation of the Martial Emperor! No surprise, back then, the Human Emperor and Culture King must have helped him a lot; otherwise, he wouldn't have reached that level."

Great Zhou King was embarrassed, unable to refute. Marquis Dingjun, however, felt a toothache listening to this. These people were insulting the Martial King! He actually preferred the Martial King, who was straightforward, loyal, and emotional—a true man. The Culture King and others were strong, but Marquis Dingjun was somewhat afraid of them. You never knew if they would smile and then kill you the next second.

He sighed inwardly. Nowadays, seeing Su Yu and his group reminded him of the ancient Human Emperor and others. In his heart, he still preferred the Hundred Battle King, who reminded him of the Martial King. The Martial King was actually quite pleasant to interact with. But deep down, Marquis Dingjun knew that in ancient times, the Martial King was just a vanguard. Decision-making was left to the Human Emperor and Culture King, or perhaps the Control King or Radiant King if those two were absent. It was rarely the Martial King, unless absolutely necessary.

Interacting with Su Yu and his group, if you were on their side, was quite relaxing. They did everything they could. You didn't need to think too much; they had everything arranged. You just needed to follow orders, and whoever you were told to kill, you could likely kill without a mess.

"Sigh!" Marquis Dingjun sighed again. It was a good thing, but it also put pressure on people like him.

While he was lost in thought, countless Lantians suddenly spoke, "One part of chaotic power, divided into ten thousand parts, with nine parts of fire power, nine different types of fire power..."

"There's fierce fire, corrosive fire, burning fire, five-element fire..."

He quickly provided some compositions, and Su Yu swiftly recorded them. Lantian was perfect for research because he had many avatars, each comprehending different daos.

Soon, the Great Ming King spoke, "There are 27 different types of formation power. It's hard to categorize specifically, but I can demonstrate, dividing them into ten thousand parts for composition..."

The Great Ming King began to demonstrate rapidly. Meanwhile, Great Zhou King continued to voice his findings, "Space, sealing, silence, various dao laws are present, with different compositions..."

"..."

Marquis Dingjun transmitted to Jiuyue and Grandstar, "Did you understand?"

Grandstar and Jiuyue nodded.

Marquis Dingjun was astonished. He only found it noisy and annoying! Mainly because there were so many Lantians, all talking, with various data and compositions. The same power, like the five-element power, wasn't it just metal, wood, water, fire, and earth? Yet these guys, just from what Marquis Dingjun heard, had over 50 types of five-element power. Was there a difference?

Truly... speechless!

Did these two really understand?

Jiuyue transmitted back, chuckling foolishly, "Understood, understood, just listen!"

In simple terms, I understood the message. Who wouldn't understand it? As for its meaning or the proportions, that's not my concern—it's too troublesome. There are some powers I've never even encountered.

Grandstar nodded in agreement. "Exactly, just listen. Why all the unnecessary chatter?"

Marquis Dingjun sighed and transmitted his voice again, "Are they always like this?"

"Rarely," Grandstar replied with a smile. "Unless they encounter a particularly difficult problem, it's uncommon for them to analyze and research together like this. Emperor Yu used to specialize in these things, but he's let it go in recent years."

"He's only 22, and he used to do this?"

"Yes," Grandstar said, unwilling to elaborate further. In truth, many of Su Yu's insights were his own deductions. Opening the Heaven Gate in this era required opportunity, but it wasn't solely about luck. Even if others had the same opportunities, they might not achieve the same results.

...

Su Yu and his group paid no heed to these matters, continuously dissecting the power of chaos. This kind of power dissection was beyond the reach of ordinary people. Even if they managed it, they couldn't distinguish between different types of power. There are many variations of even a single type of fire power. Without deep understanding of the Great Dao, how could one differentiate?

Fortunately, Su Yu and his companions were well-versed in these matters. Su Yu constantly compiled his findings, realizing that the main powers within the chaos were limited to a few types. The Five Elements, yin and yang, life and death—Su Yu had contemplated these before, forming the foundation of his "Yu" character divine character. His perception was sharper than others.

Of course, there were other powers, and quite a few at that, with many subdivisions. Previously, in his quest to steal the power of the River of Time, Su Yu had witnessed countless powers of the Great Dao, giving him some sense of them now.

The greatest help in his research came from Lantian. This individual had truly encountered all kinds of powers. However, with so many power systems, the group was so busy day and night that they almost forgot why they came to the Upper Realm in the first place.

...

At the same time, in the Upper Realm, in a small city, Marquis Shadow furrowed his brows. It had been seven days since he first contacted Marquis Dingjun, yet there was still no response.

Where exactly was Marquis Dingjun? Should he meet him? Was it impossible to meet?

"Sigh!" Marquis Shadow sighed inwardly, feeling a bit anxious. What had happened to Marquis Dingjun?

Just then, Marquis Shadow's expression changed slightly. His ears twitched as he sensed two powerful demons flying through the air in the distance. Before he could hear what they were saying, one of the demon experts shouted loudly, "Demon envoy, seeking an audience with the Holy Nether Dao Master!"

In the small city, a newly ascended Daofuse Realm expert appeared in the air and said indifferently, "What brings the demon envoy here?"

"By order of the Demon Council, we invite the powerful of the myriad races to besiege the Human Race's Marquis Huoyun!" the demon expert shouted. "The remnants of the Human Race must be eradicated. They frequently attack various races, causing harm to the myriad races! Now, the whereabouts of Marquis Huoyun at Divine Fire Mountain have been exposed. The demon race invites the heroes of the world to eliminate the traitor Huoyun! The demon race has already sealed off Divine Fire Mountain..."

The Holy Nether Dao Master listened for a while, frowning slightly, and after a long pause, he said slowly, "I understand. I will go to Divine Fire Mountain to assist in ten days."

The demon envoy smiled and said, "The Holy Nether Dao Master is wise. This battle is merely to deter other remnants of the Human Race. Killing one Huoyun remnant is easy for the allied forces of the immortals and demons. Flattening Divine Fire Mountain is effortless! We still have other places to visit, so we won't take up more of your time!"

"Safe travels!" the Holy Nether Dao Master said politely, and the two envoys quickly departed.

Marquis Shadow's face changed. Marquis Huoyun... had been exposed!

Although everyone knew the general location of some Human Race marquises, some dangerous places were vast. Even if you knew they were there, entering recklessly could lead to heavy losses. Divine Fire Mountain was more dangerous than Bright Moon Flower Valley. The flowers in Bright Moon Flower Valley only had Daofuse power and could only kill Daofuse experts when combined. But Divine Fire Mountain, with its volcanic terrain and fiery veins, posed some danger even to Heavenly Kings. Marquis Huoyun was strongest there because he was Marquis Huoyun. Previously, the myriad races feared losses, so even knowing he was there, they didn't bother him. Now they were planning to besiege Marquis Huoyun and were inviting powerful experts from the myriad races!

"Marquis Huoyun..." Marquis Shadow was shaken. With such a commotion, Marquis Huoyun couldn't escape. The key was that the news was suddenly made public... Clearly, this time the demon race wasn't worried about leaks, or perhaps they deliberately leaked the information.

"Marquis Dingjun!" Marquis Shadow quickly assessed the situation. Perhaps it was related to Marquis Dingjun. Marquis Dingjun had been taken away, and Marquis Shadow was also speculating about who had taken him. Was it a Human Race expert? An ally? Or an enemy? Now it seemed it might be an ally or even the Human Race itself. Was the demon race trying to lure them out?

With doubts and struggles, Marquis Shadow quickly sent out a third request for a meeting. Something had happened. Marquis Huoyun was one of the stronger Daofuse experts among the six Human Race Daofuse experts. If Marquis Huoyun also died, it would be a huge problem. With Minshan dead, Dingjun missing, and Huoyun potentially dying... it would be a massive issue. The Human Race in the Upper Realm would be left with only him, Marquis Yunshui, and General Yingwu as Daofuse experts. What could three Daofuse experts do?

"Did Marquis Dingjun betray us? Does he have support?" With these questions, Marquis Shadow was very anxious. The news was spreading widely, and he was even more worried that Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu wouldn't be able to resist going to Divine Fire Mountain. If that happened... the foundation of the Human Race in the Upper Realm could easily be wiped out. Of course, according to previous agreements, they should avoid rescue missions in times of crisis. But previously, Marquis Minshan was there to hold the line. Now that Minshan was dead, Marquis Shadow couldn't hold back the others. At this moment, Marquis Shadow was extremely anxious.

Ten days! In ten days, the powerful of the myriad races would gather at Divine Fire Mountain. "If Marquis Dingjun doesn't respond within five days... I'll have to go near Divine Fire Mountain to investigate the situation. I hope Marquis Yunshui and the others won't show up..."

Marquis Shadow was worried.

...

Meanwhile, Marquis Dingjun was also frowning. Marquis Shadow had contacted him for the third time, and this time it seemed urgent. Marquis Dingjun couldn't hold back any longer. He stood up and looked at the tireless experts, saying in a deep voice, "Emperor Yu, Marquis Shadow has contacted me for the third time. It's urgent, and he wants to meet!"

Su Yu was compiling all the data at the moment. He glanced at Marquis Dingjun, and after a long pause, he said somewhat absentmindedly, "Marquis Dingjun?"

"..."

Damn! Marquis Dingjun was speechless. Had they forgotten they were in the Upper Realm? And forgotten that he had been waiting here for many days? Even the Iron Devourer Beast, Jiuyue, had fallen asleep. Had they forgotten about them?

Marquis Dingjun was helpless and repeated himself. Only then did Su Yu come to his senses and nod, "I understand. How long has it been?"

"Eight days in total!"

For these eight days, these people hadn't rested, and countless Lantians hadn't stopped talking. Marquis Dingjun had long wanted to die, and he admired Jiuyue for being able to sleep through it. Impressive!

But at this moment, he couldn't care less. Marquis Shadow had requested a meeting three times in a row, and he was also getting anxious. Had Su Yu and the others finished their work? How long had it been!

At this moment, Su Yu organized his materials and exhaled, "Only eight days? I thought it had been much longer."

He didn't rush to respond. Instead, he carefully reviewed his notes and smiled, "I feel like we're almost there. There might still be some gaps, but it's probably hard to identify them now. Only through continuous experimentation can we find some missing powers."

Countless Lantians merged into one, transforming into Lantian's true form—a handsome young man. Well, who knew if it was his true form. Lantian's face was pale, and he smiled, "Even if we find all the powers, recombining them, adjusting the proportions, and transforming them into the power of chaos isn't a simple task."

Su Yu nodded, "I know that. There's no rush. We'll experiment slowly! If we succeed, both of us will have the hope of transforming into the power of chaos, freely traversing Chaos Mountain, and even impersonating ancient beasts!"

"Emperor Yu..." Marquis Dingjun was anxious. Su Yu turned to look at him and said after a long pause, "Why the rush? Marquis Shadow isn't dead yet! If there were a real problem, he wouldn't have time to find you, let alone meet with you!"

Su Yu scolded him and quickly added, "We'll meet tomorrow. Tonight, I'll try to deduce the power of chaos."

He wasn't in a hurry. After all, it wasn't his problem. Was anything more important than deducing the power of chaos? Moreover, it was so urgent that he had to be cautious of a trap. Wasn't it too coincidental? If they hadn't come, nothing would have happened. But as soon as they arrived, everything was urgent?

Su Yu thought there was a high chance it was a trap or something related to him. They had endured for 6,000 years, and now they couldn't wait a few days?

Marquis Dingjun was worried, but Su Yu, as an outsider, could see things clearly. It was likely related to him and his group. If they could restore the power of chaos...

Su Yu quickly thought, revealing a faint smile. Would the people of the Control King's lineage know the power of chaos? Surely someone would! Not the kind deduced from myriad paths like himself, but simply cultivating the power of chaos, like ancient beasts. Once he mastered the power of chaos, the myriad races would quickly associate it with Chaos Mountain. He didn't need to create much commotion; he just needed to display this power, and the myriad races would soon pay attention to Chaos Mountain!

This was the real deal!

"Alright, we can only deduce this much for now. Tomorrow, I'll meet with Marquis Shadow... If there's a trap, I'll just be careful. At worst, I'll run to Chaos Mountain!"

Su Yu thought to himself as he continued to adjust the powers. In front of him, strands of the power of laws kept collapsing. The Great Zhou King and the others watched silently. No one was in a hurry. Patience was a virtue, and Marquis Dingjun, despite his age, still couldn't see through it.

...

That night, Su Yu tried countless times.

The next day, Su Yu's face was pale, and he appeared somewhat frail. Under the worried gaze of Marquis Dingjun, several Daofuse cultivators flew together towards Chaos Mountain.

Mid-flight, Lantian vanished.

After a while, the Great Zhou King and a few others also disappeared.

In the end, only Su Yu and Marquis Dingjun were left, landing outside Chaos Mountain. Marquis Dingjun, unable to wait any longer, crushed a jade pendant, awaiting the arrival of Marquis of Shadows.
