Chapter 757: Chaos in the Upper Realm

The ideal is grand, but reality is cruel.

The reason Su Yu wanted to dig a hole first was to sort through the myriad daos in his mind. He had comprehended many great daos, but most were only superficially understood. He needed to organize them systematically.

Opening a dao was not easy.

Or rather, at this moment, Su Yu was merely trying to feel his way across the river, attempting a simple trial. Even the fusion of myriad daos was a difficult point. At this time, Su Yu just wanted to make a start. He could perfect it later.

The Time Sage's Book of Time was gradually perfected in its embryonic form, aiming for a one-time completion. Once the Time Dao was successfully opened, it might instantly possess the power of the Death Dao's master. This was the difference between Su Yu and the Time Sage. Of course, the essence of myriad daos returning to one was the same. However, Su Yu's later perfection might be even more difficult because he had already opened a dao, leaving little room for error.

"Time Sage..."

At this moment, Su Yu thought of the Book of Time again. Should he devour the Book of Time? Was the Time Sage truly dead? If not, why didn't the Time Sage use the Book of Time to open a dao in the end? Or was there no opportunity, no time left?

This was something Su Yu had yet to understand. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that the Time Sage must have wanted to open the heavens. But why not take the risk and try?

"If it were me, at the critical moment, regardless of perfection, I'd try to open a dao. Maybe there's a chance to turn the tables."

Was the Book of Time thrown back into the Myriad Realms by the Time Sage? At the last moment, was there no chance to open a dao, or was it that after the Heaven Gate, the Time Sage couldn't open a dao? Was there a flaw?

Various thoughts emerged.

Opening a dao was definitely not simple. The fusion of myriad daos might be beyond Su Yu's capability. The dao he opened might be extremely simple, but it would be enough. The hardest part was the beginning! Without a start, how could he continue?

"Lantian..."

Su Yu called out, and soon said, "Senior Hongmeng, call my teachers and others. Also, there are some undead on Hetu's side, all students of the Culture King, Principal Wan..."

Su Yu spoke, summoning them one by one, and said solemnly, "In the coming days, everyone should organize what they have learned. I need to study the fusion of daos. Let's set a limit of half a month!"

"In half a month, the Human Realm should be tidied up. Ten days should be enough to dig the hole... Within a month, we will sink the entire Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm and prepare to open a dao!"

At this moment, the group of light points appeared somewhat solemn. Doubao also stopped chasing Hongmeng around. The Great Zhou King manifested his shadow, looked at Su Yu, and sighed, "Opening a dao at this moment... could be very dangerous, right?"

Su Yu smiled, "Dangerous? A bit. The biggest danger is the failure of the fusion of myriad daos, unable to carve out the power of the dao from chaos... At that time, the Mark of Civilization might be destroyed... I might really become a Sunmoon Realm cultivator!"

That was probably the greatest loss. The dao would be severed! Everything Su Yu had invested in the Mark of Civilization would turn to nothing, which would be an enormous loss for Su Yu. He had invested too much in the Mark of Civilization. Numerous carriers, countless treasures, and countless corpses. He had even fused a complete corpse of a master of rules into it. Su Yu had integrated treasures he had acquired over the years into the Mark of Civilization. If it were destroyed, his foundation would truly be gone!

If it were destroyed, could Su Yu start over again... even if he could, would he have another chance? Where would he find another master of rules' corpse? Where would he kill so many powerful beings again?

Hearing Su Yu's words, the Great Zhou King sighed, "Why... not wait a bit longer?"

Su Yu laughed, "Wait for what? The Time Sage probably thought the same back then, to perfect it first before opening a dao! The key is... where do you find so many opportunities, so much time to wait for you? Anything could happen, maybe I'll die tomorrow!"

Time waits for no one!

Wait?

If he waited for perfection, Su Yu would have to wait for everyone to thoroughly research all the fusion methods of the daos, then wait for all the virtual daos to grow to the Daofuse Realm, or even better, to the realm of a master of rules. By then, he would be immensely powerful. Once he opened a dao, he might instantly become a powerhouse on par with the masters of the Death Dao.

This was probably the Time Sage's philosophy. But she met with an accident. Unfortunately! The Human Emperor also waited, waiting to perfect things slowly, waiting to open things slowly... and he too met with an accident!

Su Yu felt that accidents in opening the heavens might be very normal. Because this was opening the heavens, truly creating the world, it couldn't be easily successful!

Moreover... what is my core dao?

Even now, Su Yu hadn't perfected his dao philosophy. The Human Emperor's was responsibility, the Death Dao's master was the Death Dao, so what was my core dao philosophy?

This was also something Su Yu needed to sort out. It might be crucial, even the core of the entire dao. The fusion of myriad daos needed a main dao to rely on as a foundation. Without a foundation, how could he open a dao?

Su Yu's urgency left the Great Zhou King speechless. He didn't know how to persuade Su Yu. Su Yu's preparations were too simple. The Human Emperor spent countless years preparing, while Su Yu... was too abrupt!

Too fast!

Now was really not the best time. Of course, for others, the sooner they observed the dao, the better. Everyone could improve a bit.

Countless thoughts emerged in the Great Zhou King's mind. His shadow trembled slightly, turning into a floating image, and he looked at Su Yu again, "When His Majesty the Human Emperor opened a dao, I didn't witness it personally, but in recent days, Emperor Yu has told me some things. That Emperor Yu's dao, like the Human Emperor's, connects to the River of Time, drawing some power, right? Is digging a hole for this preparation?"

Su Yu shook his head, "No, I won't connect to the River of Time for now. The power of the River of Time is too strong. I just want to open a small dao! Unlike the Human Emperor, who needed a lot of energy and power of laws to support! Currently, I don't need much power, even enough to make me a Heavenly King is fine, even if I don't become a Heavenly Sovereign... In that case, the free power outside is enough for me to open a dao!"

"The power of the River of Time is too strong, it might scatter the small dao I open!"

"If later, I want to strengthen my dao's power, then I might need to steal a lot of power of laws to perfect my dao... but obviously not now!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, that was true. Su Yu's requirements weren't high. He just wanted to open a dao first, not needing too much energy support for now.

"Then Emperor Yu... what dao will he use as a foundation?"

He asked again, was Su Yu prepared for this?

He was somewhat conflicted, "I... want to ask one more thing, Emperor Yu... did you feel anything in the Source of the Dao, did you... did you..."

Su Yu glanced at him, sneered, "Are you talking about the Human Emperor's dao? You really know a lot! You're a complete old fraud! I suspect you're selecting successors for the Human Emperor! What Torchbearer, you old guy, you're just picking disciples or successors for the Human Emperor! But you're so weak, are you sure you're qualified?"

Su Yu snorted, "Old fraud, I seriously suspect you're hiding something, hiding a trump card! I said Hundred Battle and the Ancient Giant Race were colluding. If the Ancient Giant Race is the bloodline left by the Human Ancestor... then you, old fraud, wouldn't be hiding the Human Emperor's bloodline, would you?"

Su Yu chuckled coldly, "There are many interesting things. This Myriad Realms... essentially, it might still be a war of the Human Race! All the Immortals, Demons, and Gods come from the Human Race, even including the Ancient Giant Race... then whose descendants are the Immortals, Demons, and Gods? Now there's a lineage of the Control King, in a few years, these self-proclaimed Holy Race guys might also become one of the myriad races..."

"By then, others will say, according to legend, the Holy Race was also a branch of the Human Race... Of course, that's just a legend, and later generations will sneer, how is that possible, we are the Human Race, what does the Holy Race have to do with us?"

Su Yu sighed, "This Myriad Realms is more complex than imagined! You've seen a lot, Great Zhou King, you've witnessed a lot, I think you still have some cards up your sleeve, but you haven't shown them... Forget it, save them for the Human Emperor's successor!"

Su Yu pouted, "When I went to the Human Emperor's dao, that dao wanted to merge with me... Sorry, I refused! That dao, maybe you know something about it, is that a path for humans to walk? That's a path of servitude! The Human Emperor only thought of the Human Emperor, not me!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King's shadow trembled, with some shaking, some unrest, his voice trembling, "You mean... the Human Emperor's dao chose you, and you... refused?"

"Yeah!"

"......"

"Why!"

The Great Zhou King roared, unable to hold back anymore. He didn't know about Su Yu refusing the dao, Su Yu never mentioned it. The Great Zhou King was extremely angry, "Why make such a choice? His Majesty the Human Emperor's dao has no traps! His Majesty is the strongest who cares most about the Human Race in this world, stronger and more responsible than the Culture King and Martial King!"

"He wouldn't be like the Culture King and Martial King, who for their own interests, chose to abandon the Human Race, chose to leave, chose to let the Human Emperor bear the calamity of world destruction!"

"They enjoyed the honor of the Human Race, the mythological status granted to them, in their eyes... self-interest far outweighed public interest!"

"Whether it's the Culture King or the Martial King, they care more about themselves!"

"Only His Majesty, for the Human Race, exhausted his efforts, he suppressed internal troubles, resolved external threats, given a few more millennia, he could completely assimilate the entire myriad races, turning these heavens into the territory of the Human Race!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was no longer his usual calm self. Perhaps the shattering of his physical body and the wounds to his Great Dao had unsettled him. Or maybe it was Su Yu's dismissive attitude that drove him to madness.

"Why do you refuse? The path of the Human Emperor, is it not good enough?" he roared. "His Majesty is the true emperor! Everything he did was for the Human Race... not like those current Human Lords, each with their own selfish desires and interests..."

The Great Zhou King was furious. "Since you can inherit it, why don't you? Even if you can't merge with it immediately, you could quickly become a Heavenly King, a Heavenly Sovereign, or even surpass the Hundred Battle King and contend with the masters of the rules!"

Why did Su Yu refuse?

Su Yu remained calm, his expression unchanging. Around them, the crowd that had been about to disperse now stood frozen, silent and fearful. It seemed a conflict had arisen between Su Yu and the Great Zhou King. This was the first time the Great Zhou King had actively sought out Su Yu for a confrontation. Previously, he had always been the most patient, even when Su Yu deliberately provoked him, he could remain calm and defuse the situation with ease.

Su Yu waited for the Great Zhou King to finish his outburst before speaking calmly, "And so what? I've said it before, I'm not the Human Emperor! Do you know the core of the Human Emperor's Great Dao? Maybe you do! But... do you think I'm that kind of person?"

He looked around, speaking slowly, "That's why there is only one Human Emperor! That's why the Culture King is just the Culture King, and the Martial King is just the Martial King! In that era, to be able to suppress the Culture King and the others, to earn their respect, the Human Emperor must have had his greatness, which no one can deny!"

It was an era of prodigies!

An era where the Four Kings shone across the Myriad Realms!

And in that era, there was only one supreme leader, the Human Emperor!

No one could deny the greatness of the Human Emperor, nor his achievements. But... not everyone wanted to become the Human Emperor!

Su Yu simply did not want to!

He looked coldly at the Great Zhou King and said indifferently, "The Human Emperor bore heavy burdens, suffering himself to bring happiness to others... He was a saint. Maybe he had his own selfish motives, maybe he had his own plans... but in my eyes, he was indeed a saint!"

"But... Great Zhou King, not everyone wants to be a saint!"

"Being a saint is too exhausting, too painful, too difficult!"

"I would rather be like the Culture King and the others, coming and going as I please, killing when I want to kill, protecting when I want to protect... I don't want the Human Race, this world, to become my shackles!"

"The Hundred Battle King has returned, and I have withdrawn. I don't want to compete with him, can't you see?"

Su Yu's voice boomed, shaking the surroundings, "If I truly wanted to become the second Human Emperor, I wouldn't have withdrawn from the Human Realm! I've said it before, I, Su Yu, will only protect and guard what I want to protect and guard. That's my responsibility!"

He shouted, "Someone like the Hundred Battle King, you want me to protect him? He did nothing wrong, maybe he was right, but he abandoned us. Why should I help him now? When he had the ability, he chose to endure for a greater victory. Why should I be responsible for him?"

"Forgiveness... is also relative! Back then, when Zhou Mingren and the others made things difficult for me at the academy, you want me to forgive them, to let bygones be bygones, is that possible?"

"The Silk Destroying King is also considered part of the Human Race. He didn't betray the Human Race, at least not in your eyes, but he wronged my teacher Liu Wenyan and the others. Should I forgive them?"

"The Shadow Marquis and the others served the Hundred Battle King, which isn't wrong. When I left, I shouldn't have abandoned them. That's also forgiveness, because they are part of the Human Race. But... I'm not happy, so why should I take them with me?"

Su Yu shouted loudly, "That's why I'm not that kind of person! The Human Emperor's Great Dao, I once manifested it in a moment of weakness, and I was asked to inherit it... I gave it up, and it never appeared again. Do you know why?"

"Because the Great Dao also knows that it was just a momentary sense of responsibility... not something that would last!"

"The Great Dao wants me to be responsible for this Human Race... what a joke!"

Su Yu said coldly, "I'm not a saint, I've said it many times! I'm just one of the myriad beings. Now that I have the ability, I'm willing to take on certain responsibilities, to help those who once helped me! I'm willing to help some pitiful people, out of compassion, not responsibility! This is not my responsibility, and I don't want to take on this responsibility!"

"If it's forced upon me, I don't need it. Zhou Tian, do you understand what I'm saying?"

This was the first time he called him by his name!

I am Su Yu, I am not the second Human Emperor, nor the successor of the Human Emperor.

I have my own thoughts, and I don't want these responsibilities forced upon me.

"Maybe one day, I will change, but... not now!"

Su Yu regained his composure, "If you think it's inappropriate, then get lost! You should still have some cards up your sleeve, go do it yourself! What I need is just a group of like-minded people. If I want to kill, they kill with me! If I want to drink, they drink with me! If I want to destroy the myriad races, they fight the Myriad Realms with me!"

"To act as I please, to speak freely, to watch the rise and fall of the world!"

"If one day, I find the Human Race annoying, they can fend for themselves, why should I care?"

"If one day, the Human Race doesn't listen to me, should I still shamelessly try to please them?"

"Begging them to help me, to listen to me, so we can all work together to revive the Human Race?"

Su Yu sneered, "The Martial Emperor once asked me why I didn't ask him for help... Ask him for what? Do you know how I replied? I said, I would rather ask the foreign races than ask the Human Race!"

"Just like today with the Hundred Battle King, could I rely on him? Maybe I could, but... why should I!"

"Maybe the Martial Emperor thought if I asked him, he would feel satisfied, vent his anger, and maybe even be willing to help the Human Race. But... why should I?"

"Maybe the Human Emperor would do that, because in his eyes, the Human Race is his responsibility, and he could beg these people for the Human Race... I can't!"

Su Yu gradually calmed down, "Zhou Tian, if you don't want to follow me, then get lost! Do whatever you want! If you think the Hundred Battle King is your ideal leader, then go join him, I won't stop you!"

The Great Zhou King's aura fluctuated, and after a long time, he almost gritted his teeth, "That's not what I mean... I just... I just don't understand, the opportunity is right in front of you, the Human Emperor has chosen you, can you really surpass the Human Emperor by opening your own path? Why... why refuse! Just because you don't want to take on this responsibility?"

"You could also wait until your Great Dao is perfected, then open your own path, then find a successor..."

Su Yu sneered, "Get lost! Do you think I'm an idiot? I'm young, but I'm not stupid! The Human Emperor's path is only half-opened! Once I merge with it, if I want to continue to grow stronger, I must perfect this path. In the process of perfecting it, I will be completely integrated into this path... and the core of the Great Dao will gradually merge with me!"

"The pen dao, I can abandon at any time, but can I withdraw from the Human Emperor's path at any time?"

"That's nonsense! I even suspect that the Human Emperor deliberately left it half-open, waiting for the next person to take over!"

"Just like Doubao's will suggestion, the Human Emperor surpasses Doubao by millions of times. Do you think with my strength, my will, once I merge with it, I still have a chance to escape?"

"Don't think I'm stupid!"

The Great Zhou King was exhausted, "Not stupid, even if you can't abandon it, the Human Emperor's path is one in a million, destined to make you a peerless powerhouse."

Su Yu laughed, "Then I'd rather be a bit weaker, as long as I'm happy! I think, the master of the rules of the path of responsibility is not as good as the carefree Skysoar Realm, you have to accept it because... I'm willing!"

"......"

Damn!

There's nothing more to say.

Su Yu said he's willing, he doesn't want this powerful strength, what can you do?

The Great Zhou King felt like dying, collapsing, "But... in ten thousand years, you're the first, why... why do this, maybe there will never be another who can inherit the Human Emperor's path..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Then pretend I don't exist, wait for the next one."

"But... there won't be another!"

The Great Zhou King was desperate, collapsing, he was almost driven mad, "If there could be another, do you think I would waste so much breath on you?"

"You know it's nonsense! Then stop waiting, wait for the Human Emperor to come back and continue it himself."

Damn it!

If I could wait for the Human Emperor to return, would I still put up with your nonsense?

The Great Zhou King was exhausted, heartbroken, and let out a voice full of endless grievance, "I really don't understand, what's wrong with His Majesty's path... and, if you really don't want to inherit it, you shouldn't have said you could, and then not inherit it, aren't you just playing with me?"

If Su Yu hadn't said anything, he wouldn't have collapsed.

But saying it and then not doing it, that's the most frustrating.

After waiting for ten thousand years, not finding anyone who could inherit it, the hope of ten thousand years had long turned into despair, he had long given up, actually didn't care much anymore.

He just wanted to ask if Su Yu had sensed any traces left by the Human Emperor in the Great Dao.

The old master had been gone too long, and then... this beast Su Yu suddenly told him, I can inherit the Great Dao, but I won't.

This... is this something a human would do?

The Great Zhou King was really about to go mad.

From hope to despair, he had long been used to it.

But this process took 10,000 years, slowly transitioning, and just a second ago, Su Yu suddenly gave him hope, infinite hope, and in the next second, Su Yu suddenly struck him heavily, turning it into despair.

The instant switch made the Great Zhou King's mentality collapse.

Su Yu, not human!

Inhuman!

Beast!

I should have slapped you to death back then, you bastard, it's infuriating!

He roared with a hint of madness, and around him, several figures from Hongmeng kept their distance. Had Su Yu driven the Great Zhou King insane? It was truly terrifying!

"Old Zhou..." 

The Great Qin King called out, trying to comfort him, "Calm down, what's the big deal if you don't inherit it? It's not the end of the world..."

"Shut up!" The Great Zhou King shouted angrily, "Shut up, did you hear me? You know nothing! You fool, I was counting on you to inherit it, but you're just an idiot, a waste. If you have the ability, go and inherit it! I've been your sidekick for hundreds of years, just hoping you'd be reliable, hoping you'd contribute more to the Human Race, hoping you'd be selfless, hoping you'd become the Human Lord of this generation, someone recognized by the Human Emperor... But you gave up halfway, you bastard, I'll kill you!"

"I was worried you'd end up like the other Human Lords, not revealing your identity, silently protecting you, never giving you pressure, never pointing fingers, letting you be at ease as a supporting role, and you still couldn't become the Human Lord... I... I must kill you!"

Boom!

The Great Zhou King went mad, transforming into a ball of light and charging at the Great Qin King!

Su Yu paused for a moment, suddenly feeling amused.

The Great Qin King... yes, the Great Qin King was indeed a special existence. In this era, no ancient figures interfered with his affairs. He was also someone secretly nurtured by the Great Zhou King as a Human Lord, but the Great Qin King couldn't suppress everyone.

However, the Great Qin King did indeed contribute a lot to the Human Race, with a strong sense of responsibility. He didn't get involved in internal strife; he focused solely on external threats. He guarded the Eastern Rift Valley for hundreds of years, while other Eternals schemed against each other, the Great Qin King focused solely on resisting the major races...

He wasn't disturbed by any ancient figures!

One could say that the Great Qin King was different from the previous nine generations of Human Lords. In the end... he couldn't become the Human Lord.

The Great Zhou King wanted the Great Qin King to develop freely. Perhaps... perhaps the Great Zhou King knew what the Human Emperor's path was, or he was certain that his ideal candidate was indeed the Great Qin King.

He gave the Great Qin King the greatest freedom, subtly influencing him, making sure he didn't think too much, just focusing on protecting the Human Race.

Now, Su Yu refused, and the Great Zhou King couldn't do anything about it. When the Great Qin King suddenly spoke up, it was no wonder the Great Zhou King went crazy.

Boom!

A battle erupted, and the Great Qin King was extremely annoyed, "Enough already, if you keep this up, I'll fight back!"

"Come on, kill me if you can!"

"Qin Guang, you dog, come on! I've put up with you for a long time!"

The Great Zhou King was furious, "Fight me! When you were young and practicing martial arts, to make you help the weak, I designed countless savior scenarios for you! To inspire your sense of responsibility, to make you stand up for the people, I had you save damsels in distress, uphold justice, gather a team, and rebel against the tyranny of the dynasty! What the hell do you know?"

"Did you really think you could find money on the road, or that you could dig up a mountain of gold just by digging randomly?"

"That gold mountain, I buried it!"

"Did you really think everyone wanted to follow you back then? It was me who made everyone lose their way, confused, and bump into you, joining you to conquer the world... just to give you more comrades..."

"I took care of you like a baby, afraid you'd develop a rebellious heart like that bastard Yue Gang, thinking someone was interfering with you, never telling you, never revealing anything, painstakingly hiding my existence..."

"In battles, wasn't it always me who found opportunities for you to win big, to win people's hearts... and yet you're useless, I might as well kill you!"

"..."

At this moment, the Great Zhou King roared continuously, filled with anger.

The Great Qin King, after a moment of shock, quickly cursed back, "Alright, I was wondering why my life was so smooth, never felt too much hardship, even when targeted by the myriad races, I always won. So it was you, you bastard! No wonder I don't like to think much, it's all your doing, I'll smash you to pieces!"

"..."

Boom!

The two really started fighting, two balls of light intertwining, fighting fiercely!

The Great Zhou King felt the Great Qin King had let him down, while the Great Qin King felt that if it weren't for the Great Zhou King's secret help, he might have been smarter now after experiencing more hardships.

Anyway, they fought!

And Su Yu, without a word, recorded a bit of it, chuckling softly.

Interesting!

You guys fight, I can't be bothered to intervene.

The Great Xia King watched for a while, seeing the Great Qin King struggling, suddenly snorted, "Am I not as smart as Old Qin? No wonder I always lost to Old Qin, it was your doing, you old bastard... I'll kill you!"

Boom!

He joined the fight, helping the Great Qin King against the Great Zhou King.

...

Su Yu couldn't be bothered. The Great Zhou King suddenly exploded, probably because he had endured for too long, and now he couldn't take it anymore, exploding at the extreme!

Could it be that his understanding of the Great Dao had deepened?

Last time, his Great Dao fusion was also because he couldn't take it anymore, and then he exploded. Was the Great Zhou King doing this for a better understanding of the Great Dao?

Who cares!

It was rare to see the Great Zhou King go crazy, always acting like an old schemer. It was nice to see him lose his temper today.

As for the fact that this fire was started by me... what does it have to do with me?

I didn't fight!

These guys, all turned into balls of light, still able to fight, not bad, their condition seems fine.

Su Yu still had things to do, no time to watch more. He recorded a bit, then casually said, "Great Zhou King, I won't inherit that path. Even though last time you kept jumping out, eager for me to inherit it immediately... but I won't take it! The Great Qin King has been secretly manipulated by you for so many years, you keep manipulating him for a few more years, maybe he'll be qualified to inherit it... no pain, no gain, fighting is healthy!"

"..."

"Ah!"

The Great Zhou King's crazy roar echoed, Su Yu ignored it, taking Old Wan and Lantian, the three of them flew out of the realm with smiles.

Fight, fight!

Wan Tiansheng transmitted with a smile, "Why provoke him?"

"The old guy hides a lot, you see, he knows the Human Emperor's path, right? But he won't tell me, probably thinks I'm not qualified to inherit it... hehe, I'll piss off this old guy, I am qualified, I just don't want it, he treats it as treasure, I treat it as grass, piss him off!"

Such malicious delight!

Wan Tiansheng was speechless, Su Yu really pissed off the Great Zhou King this time.

Su Yu continued, "He might still be hiding something, ignore him, let him reveal it himself! The old guy finally showed some cards this time! Let's go study the theory of Great Dao fusion, and in a few days, see who will come with us."

Lantian chuckled, transmitting, "Why don't we play big, take everyone away, I'll leave him with tens of thousands of clones..."

"..."

Inhuman!

Su Yu grinned, "Be human, if Hundred Battle sees only tens of thousands left, he'll probably go crazy, and if he sees they're all you... hehe, I'm afraid he'll explode, why bother."

Speaking of which, it's really interesting!

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Disgusting him a bit isn't bad, how about this, leave him a palace, Lantian, you transform into hundreds of beauties, keep him company?"

"..."

Lantian glanced at Su Yu, Wan Tiansheng's head was about to explode, wanting to escape this place.

This... too ruthless.

Su Yu continued, "He might find out, Hundred Battle might have opened the Heaven Gate, even if not, I think he has similar means! How about this, let's find a way, hide a bit, prepare defenses... then create some handsome guys, go seduce Marquis Yunshui and the others..."

Be human!

Wan Tiansheng quickly changed the topic, "Won't the time be too short, you open the path so quickly, I'm worried the path you open will have too many flaws! It might even collapse!"

Su Yu nodded, "That's possible, but... let's try, and perfect it later. If it were the ancient times, opening the path like this, the Lord of Rules would see through the flaws at a glance, and slap the Great Dao broken... but now, aren't there no such figures?"

Su Yu chuckled, "The old guys now, they're the leftovers, not many can see through!"

Daring to propose opening the path now, Su Yu had weighed the pros and cons.

"Let's find people first, clarify some theories of Great Dao fusion..."

Su Yu didn't care too much, if he waited, who knew when he'd open the path!

"Also, if I don't open the path, there's a big problem..."

"What?"

"The Culture King's Residence can't be moved!"

Su Yu explained, "If it can't be moved, the Human Lord Seal can't be used, even if I don't become the Human Lord, I have to retrieve this Human Lord Seal, turn it into a Death Spirit Seal, that's fine too, besides, I still control a large number of humans! Also, if it's not moved, how will Fat Ball come along..."

"I can only open the path, no matter how small or weak, it doesn't matter, first move the Culture King's Residence, place it at the fork, if it can't be placed at the fork, put it in my Great Dao, help suppress the floating Great Dao... just to take Fat Ball and the others away!"

Wan Tiansheng sighed, "Are you going to empty the Culture King's house?"

"Am I?"

Su Yu laughed, "I'm not touching his house, just changing the location!"

No more on this topic, soon, Su Yu took the two of them, quickly left the realm, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Find more people, help research the theory of Great Dao fusion.

Then get started!

...

At the same time.

Soul Burying Mountain.

Hundred Battle paused, suddenly chuckling, "Let's wait, it needs some time."

Behind him, Marquis Yunshui softly asked, "Your Majesty means?"

"Wait for him to make a decision, whether to leave, stay, or... have a duel with me?"

Hundred Battle King chuckled softly, "From what you've said, it seems that Su Yu might not be willing to join forces with me... Whether his previous defeat was real or feigned, perhaps he has already guessed something."

Beside him, Marquis Nanxi spoke in a low voice, "Your Majesty, if we don't return now, and if he decides to just give up..."

"It doesn't matter."

Hundred Battle King continued to smile, "If that's the case, we'll just start over!"

With those words, he sat down cross-legged, gazing at the faintly visible entrance. He chuckled, "It's been six thousand years since I last visited the lower realm. I wonder how much it has changed..."

Marquis Yunshui nodded, "There have been quite a few changes, but it's still thriving. By the way, if His Majesty says he wants to leave, where could he go?"

"Where to?"

Hundred Battle King smiled, "The Death Realm, the Endless Void, he can choose either!"

"What if he doesn't leave?"

"Doesn't leave?"

Hundred Battle King pondered for a moment, then smiled again, "He won't. From what you've said, he's a smart person. If he meets me and refuses to submit... then there's only one path left, and that's a battle. In his current state, he can't match me."

"Your Majesty... have you considered..."

Marquis Yunshui hesitated, but Hundred Battle King waved his hand slightly, "No need! It's not the time yet. With strong enemies nearby, why give others a reason to laugh at us?"

Hundred Battle King laughed heartily, "Besides, whether or not he is the Human Lord is actually irrelevant to me!"

After saying this, he turned his head to look towards Chaos Mountain. After a long pause, he said, "When we go down, keep a low profile and maintain the status quo! The Control King's lineage and the myriad races have not yet clashed, and we also need time to recover and strengthen our power!"

The others nodded slightly.

Just as Marquis Nanxi was about to say something more, suddenly, in the Chaos Mountain region, a giant axe appeared, cutting across the sky!

A figure soared through the air, the giant axe cleaving a massive mountain in two!

"Traitors of the Control King's lineage, come out, and I'll kill you all!"

Boom!

The giant axe swept across the sky, leveling several massive mountains.

Hundred Battle King looked over and smiled, "The giant axe has appeared. It seems the chaos in the upper realm might start with the giant axe!"

Marquis Nanxi frowned slightly, "The giant axe is reckless. Charging in like this, if surrounded by the Control King's lineage, I'm afraid..."

"The myriad races won't let the giant axe fall easily. This isn't like the old days. Now, the greatest enemy of the myriad races is the Control King's lineage!"

Hundred Battle King said, closing his eyes, "Don't worry about it. The giant axe isn't so easy to kill, and the Control King's lineage won't act rashly against him, giving the myriad races an opportunity!"

The group said nothing more. Since His Majesty had spoken, there must be a reason.
