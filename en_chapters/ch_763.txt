Chapter 763: An Unbelievable Victory

Su Yu suppressed the thoughts swirling in his mind; there was no time to dwell on them. At this moment, a massive surge of river water erupted forth. However, this was not ordinary water; it was the power of countless laws, and it was transforming the entire Abyssal Realm into chaos. Once it turned chaotic, this place would no longer be suitable for ordinary life.

Chaos was not necessarily beneficial. If it were truly good, the heavens would not have been created. The Control King's lineage lived in the land of chaos, but they likely had to establish domains unaffected by chaos, or else they would be impacted.

Su Yu couldn't afford to be distracted. He quickly began to merge various powers of the Great Dao. Meanwhile, he observed how these powers naturally transformed into chaotic power, which was also a form of cultivation. He needed chaotic power to forge the barriers of the River of Time. However, he couldn't let everything turn to chaos, or it would be ruined. This required an extremely strong control ability.

All of this would become part of Su Yu's understanding as he opened his own path. This was the benefit of creating a breach this time. As for the gains of others, Su Yu couldn't concern himself with that.

At this moment, all the powerful beings soared into the sky, swiftly organizing the powers of the Great Dao. The myriad paths were mixed, and they needed to extract the paths they excelled in, bit by bit. The rest was mainly handled by Lantian and Wan Tiansheng, who were both diligently organizing the powers of the Great Dao while recording and observing data. This would aid Su Yu in opening his path.

The water of time poured out, causing the entire River of Time to tremble slightly. Although it was just a small breach, it was at the riverbed. In such a situation, even a small breach could create a massive vortex in the River of Time. The River of Time seemed to be slightly interrupted. A large amount of the river's water surged toward this breach.

The breach created by the Human Emperor and the one in the Death Path were already stable. No matter how turbulent the water was, the flow had stabilized. However, this newly created breach was not yet stable and continued to be impacted. Not only was it being impacted, but the breach also seemed to be expanding.

Su Yu hadn't paid much attention to it initially because the breach he created wasn't large. However, as he was constructing the barrier and perfecting the Great Dao, his expression suddenly changed. Why was the power of laws growing stronger and more abundant?

Others couldn't see it, but when Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate, his expression changed. He saw a small breach, but it seemed to be cracking and expanding!

"Damn it!" Su Yu cursed in alarm, "Why is the breach expanding?"

Lantian, who was also sensitive to the changes, felt the massive surge of river water impacting him. He was equally alarmed, "Isn't the time barrier stable? How did the Human Emperor and others create their breaches?"

If this continued, and the breach became a large gap, Su Yu and the others wouldn't be able to seal it. The massive surge of river water would transform this place into chaos in no time. All the preparations they had made would become illusions.

Su Yu's expression shifted as he opened his Heaven Gate again to take a closer look. He frowned slightly, "Not good, it seems I've disrupted the lines, causing a chain reaction that interrupted the lines of the entire breach! If this continues, this section of the River of Time might collapse!"

That would be disastrous! Not only would the realm be destroyed, but it might also trigger other chain reactions. How could this be?

Su Yu frowned. This wasn't right. The Human Emperor and others had created much larger breaches without issue. How could such a small breach cause such a change? This was absurd!

...

At the same time, the full-scale battle erupted swiftly and ended just as quickly. The opposing side had no intention of fighting to the death. Although a full-scale battle could suppress the human race, it would also result in heavy losses. There was no need for that. Soon, they would be able to synchronize the flow of time and attack from the future to the present. Why fight to the death now?

At that moment, the shadowy figure glanced back, frowning slightly. What was happening? Strange events were occurring one after another. The entire River of Time seemed off. Not only him, but suddenly, a powerful voice spoke, "Your Majesty, is the water of the River of Time flowing backward?"

Strange! The water of the River of Time usually flowed parallel, and this was considered upstream, flowing downward. But not this fast! Now, it seemed to be accelerating. They, too, would gradually accelerate their return with the flow of water.

The shadowy figure looked back and suddenly submerged into the water, silently sensing the flow's frequency. Gradually, his expression turned peculiar. This... this familiar feeling. Was someone opening a breach in the River of Time? Opening a breach in the River of Time wasn't something just anyone could do. It required control over myriad paths. Generally, opening a breach was for preparing to open the heavens.

But... damn it! The Myriad Realms didn't even have a ruler of laws! Even if there was one, it would be from the older generation. But even the older generation, even that fool Martial Emperor, dreaming of opening the heavens was absurd! Besides Martial Emperor, who else could open the heavens? Impossible!

If not to open the heavens, why open a breach? For fun? As the time for their return drew nearer, his senses became clearer, and he grew more puzzled. For so many years, there hadn't been significant changes, but recently, there were quite a few anomalies.

"Opening a breach in the River of Time..." he murmured, uncertain. Or was it that a tributary of the Great Dao had broken, causing the river's turbulence? For a tributary to break, a ruler of laws must have fallen, and the Great Dao must have been completely severed. Besides their side, there shouldn't be anyone else, right?

"Could it be... Martial Emperor was killed?" Opening a breach in the River of Time seemed unlikely, but if Martial Emperor was killed and his Great Dao was severed... that was possible. Martial Emperor wasn't very bright and was sealed. Gathering dozens of quasi-kings to kill him was feasible. Dozens might not even be needed! Perhaps ten or so could do it, given he was sealed. Or gather some who had the realm of a ruler of laws but not the strength, and maybe even fewer, seven or eight could kill him.

"Martial Emperor was killed?" "Previously, my Starry Sky Seal also appeared in the River of Time... is it related to this?" "Could it be that to suppress Martial Emperor, he was killed?" At this moment, he mostly thought that Martial Emperor was dead. The fall of this ruler of laws would cause such a ripple. As for opening a breach in the River of Time... without immense strength, even if you opened it, you might not be able to close it.

Opening a breach in the River of Time was usually to steal power in preparation for opening the heavens. Yet, it didn't seem like opening the heavens. At this moment, the opener hesitated. Soon, he surfaced on the river, and voices echoed around him, "Your Majesty, the river's turbulence, is it because a ruler of laws has fallen?" "The Myriad Realms doesn't have a ruler of laws. Are there any still alive?" "Have the Culture King and others returned?" "Or did a chaotic ancient beast connect to the Great Dao and enter the River of Time, only to be killed?" "..."

Questions arose, and after a moment, the shadowy figure said, "Perhaps Martial Emperor was killed." He didn't speculate about an opener. Even if there was one... he didn't want to mention it. He didn't want the opener's existence to be known. It might not be a good thing! Knowing too much might not be beneficial. If these people harbored such thoughts, it would be disastrous, with a high chance of failure and backlash leading to death.

Of course, he thought the likelihood of Martial Emperor's death was higher than that of an opener. "Martial Emperor?" "The one who was sealed?" "Still alive?" "I thought he was long dead!" "Was he killed this time? What a pity!" "What's there to pity? That stubborn guy would cause trouble if we returned. If he's dead, he's dead. But... the Myriad Realms has no ruler of laws, and he was killed. Was it the ancient beasts?" "A ruler of laws dying in this era, how embarrassing!"

A group of top-tier beings exchanged thoughts, silently despising Martial Emperor. What a miserable death! In this era, you could still be killed? Truly... a pitiful existence. As they conversed, the shadowy figure fell silent, pondering. If Martial Emperor was killed, did something unexpected happen? Although Martial Emperor wasn't exactly on their side, he was still human. His death might not be good for humanity.

"What a pity!" A slight sigh echoed in his heart. Perhaps his death was related to his Starry Sky Seal. Could it be... the person Xingyue chose killed Martial Emperor? Was that person human? A human expert killed Martial Emperor? "Why?" A barely audible sigh escaped. Truly a pity. Martial Emperor surviving until now wasn't easy, only to be killed at this moment. The shadowy figure felt a tinge of complexity.

...

When many powerful beings repeatedly mention someone, that person will inevitably sense it. Especially when those individuals possess wills strong enough to shake the heavens and earth. Their will imprints the River of Time.

Luminous Domain Mansion.

At this moment, Martial Emperor's shadow suddenly appeared, his expression changing drastically. He felt a great calamity looming, a sudden premonition. Calculating with his fingers, his expression changed again. This... it seemed countless people were cursing him to death!

Damn it! What was going on? "Could it be related to the Abyssal Realm's collapse?" "Su Yu... wants to kill me!" Martial Emperor muttered, his expression fluctuating. Was Su Yu truly capable of killing him, given the immense sense of crisis he felt? Impossible! Yet, the feeling from the Great Dao's imprint was so clear. It was as if countless people were saying, "Martial Emperor is dead!" "Martial Emperor is beyond saving!" "Poor Martial Emperor!"

Such powerful will imprints must have arisen from the Great Dao sensing a crisis.

As for others talking about me... Seriously, I've been sealed for hundreds of thousands of years. Who would have the time to think about me, except for Su Yu? Who else could it be?

"Intimidate me?"

"Threaten me?"

The Martial Emperor's face turned livid. "Su Yu! I'm not afraid of you!"

Hmph!

Are you trying to threaten me?

Is that it?

Last time, this guy attacked me in the Great Dao. Maybe it's him again this time. Yes, that's right. Maybe he's lurking in the River of Time, near my Great Dao, constantly thinking about me!

Now, the Martial Emperor understood.

His powerful aura erupted!

In an instant, it pierced through the heavens and the earth.

After all, the Martial Emperor was a ruler of his domain, a being at the level of a master of laws. At this moment, how could he just admit defeat?

"Come if you dare! This emperor is not afraid of you! If you have the guts, just kill me!"

A furious roar echoed through the heavens and the earth!

The world trembled!

Want to kill me?

No way!

I roamed the ancient times, dominated my domain, and even Taishan couldn't defeat me. Does everyone think they can kill me?

I don't believe it!

...

This furious roar pierced through the heavens and the earth, echoing in all directions.

Even the Abyssal Realm heard this angry shout.

Everyone was stunned, and they all trembled.

Wan Tiansheng and the others also changed their expressions, looking at Su Yu.

"The Martial Emperor?"

Wan Tiansheng asked.

Su Yu nodded, frowning. "This idiot, who is he fighting with? In the current Myriad Realms, there's probably no one who can kill him, right? Unless now, he's sealed, and all sides join forces, there's still hope to kill him... Otherwise, it's hard to kill him, right?"

Such grievance, such indignation, with just a single "you," it seemed like there was only one person.

"Hundred Battles?"

Su Yu frowned and said, "Could it be that Hundred Battles returned early?"

Did Hundred Battles go to deal with the Martial Emperor?

Look at that, he's so aggrieved!

He seems about to explode.

Forget it, let the dogs fight, it's none of my business!

He had no intention of intervening, as it had nothing to do with him.

He hadn't provoked the Martial Emperor, and he hadn't been to the Luminous Domain Mansion for a few days. It would be great if this guy and Hundred Battles started fighting.

At this moment, Su Yu was more concerned about the ever-expanding crack. He frowned for a long time and said in a deep voice, "I'll go up and repair it, fix those cracked lines first! What a hassle! Just broke it, and now I have to repair it again... If I don't fix it, I won't be able to maintain the existence of the opening!"

He had to repair the lines that had just broken, or rather, bend them to fix them.

Just leave an opening; there's no need to break it.

So... damn, I shouldn't have broken it just now, just bending it would have been enough?

"Right..."

Su Yu murmured, "It's like knitting yarn; you can't break the thread, just stretch it, and the mesh will get bigger! No wonder!"

Learn from mistakes!

Su Yu suddenly learned a lesson and immediately said, "I can't just open holes randomly in the future. I said, breaking it doesn't feel right, and indeed, it really isn't right!"

Su Yu said this, frowning, "Breaking it requires enduring the power of the Great Dao, which is somewhat troublesome and quite painful. Heavendoom, do you know that feeling?"

In the distance, Heavendoom responded smoothly, "I know, it's too painful!"

"......"

After saying that, Heavendoom was stunned. Was there anything wrong with that?

He looked up at Su Yu, and at this moment, many others also looked at Heavendoom, their eyes strange. They quickly lowered their heads and continued to busy themselves. Everyone was very busy.

We know nothing!

Su Yu... was he suspicious?

Was he setting a trap for Heavendoom?

Otherwise, why ask such a question out of the blue?

Heavendoom's face stiffened because he noticed Su Yu was also looking at him.

Damn!

Heavendoom cursed inwardly. Why are you looking at me!

It's not like I'm the only one who saw it!

Why are you looking at me?

Stop looking!

And Su Yu, his expression changed unpredictably, then he smiled, a smile that made Heavendoom's hair stand on end. He feared these people smiling like this; it never boded well!

Clearly, he sensed that Su Yu... might have really discovered something.

And Su Yu, with a bright smile.

Not angry, not furious.

As long as I'm not embarrassed, the embarrassment is yours!

Just wait!

Alright, I said it didn't feel right, so... did they discover what I just did?

Really!

So, you were all watching.

From when did it start?

From which sentence?

Cursing is nothing, but did you see me cry?

Did you see me calling for my dad to save me?

He scanned the crowd, remembering how many people there were.

Very well!

We have a tradition of settling scores in the autumn!

Su Yu smiled brightly, said nothing, and stepped into the air. "Everyone, continue to comb through the myriad paths, comprehend the Great Dao. Just now, there was a surge of physical power. Everyone, restore your physical bodies. Even if you're not as strong as before, you need to recover! I'll enter the River of Time again to comb through it and reconnect the broken Great Dao!"

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "This time, the price I paid to open this opening was not small! Everyone, I'll assess your progress later... If your progress doesn't meet my expectations... Sorry, I'll think you're just going through the motions, not dedicated. Everyone must make progress!"

"At the very least, everyone must advance one level, third-tier to second-tier, second-tier to Heavenly King, Heavenly King to Heavenly Sovereign... If you don't reach it, when I finish opening the path, I'll spar with everyone one by one, so you understand... only those who emerge from battle are true strong!"

With a cold snort, he stepped into the air and once again entered the River of Time.

The scene was silent.

The next moment, countless people transmitted their voices to Heavendoom: "You idiot!"

"Fool!"

"You deserve to be beaten to death!"

"Stupid guy, why did you respond?"

"..."

Heavendoom's expression changed, and the next moment, he snorted, sneered, "I'm a fourth-tier Daofuse, soon to be third-tier. I've completed my goal, everyone... good luck!"

Who are you cursing?

Just wait to die!

I'm weak, I'm proud!

I can easily go from fourth-tier to third-tier, but you guys, especially those Heavenly Kings who cursed me, haha, spit on you, just wait for Su Yu to find fault with you.

Heavenly King to Heavenly Sovereign, can you do it?

If not... just wait to be beaten.

Heavendoom cackled, and the next moment, he cheerfully said, "Get to work! Where's my Great Club Dao? Get to work, get to work, everyone, don't just stand there!"

He was in a good mood.

Let them curse.

I'm not afraid!

Many people were exhausted. Was this guy doing it on purpose?

He's really something!

Of course, everyone was in a good mood at this moment. Wan Tiansheng said nothing more, shouting, "Continue to comb through the myriad paths. This time, everyone can advance further! Daofuse will break a hundred, and soon we'll catch up with other major forces!"

This time, there's really hope for Daofuse to break through.

Not to mention, all 36 Guardians have the hope of advancing to the Daofuse Realm.

And on the human side, the leaders of the Great Han, Great Tang, Great Shang, and Great Song are all advancing towards Daofuse, and under several ancient marquises, there are also people advancing towards Daofuse.

A hundred Daofuse is not a dream!

As he was speaking, a joyful roar echoed through the realm, and the next moment, a massive furball, covering the sky, laughed wildly.

"Hahaha, I want to eat Tiangu!"

"Hahaha!"

The giant Doubao flew wildly, its aura surging, rumbling!

The power of the Great Dao was intense!

Previously, Doubao, whose Great Dao was pointed out by Su Yu, now had a boiling aura, clearly stepping into the Heavenly King realm. It had been stuck at this level for too many years, while others had advanced one after another.

Back then, peers like Tiangu, the Great Zhou King, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, and Old Turtle had almost all stepped into the Heavenly King realm, except for it, which had been stuck at the second tier.

Today, Doubao absorbed a large amount of the power of laws, comprehended the Great Dao, and finally broke through!

And Wan Tiansheng and the others all smiled.

This time, the first Heavenly King was born!

There were actually quite a few second-tier powerhouses, like the Great Xia and Great Qin Kings, and others like Yingwu and Dingjun had all stepped into the second tier, but Heavenly King... was not easy to say.

Yingwu and Dingjun were originally third-tier, and actually, after observing the map of the Great Dao last time, they had stepped into the second tier.

But having just stepped into the second tier, becoming a Heavenly King wasn't as simple as just absorbing some of the power of the Great Dao; their comprehension of the rules of the Great Dao wasn't that deep yet.

At this moment, the one most likely to advance to the Heavenly King next was Jiuyue!

And at this time, suddenly, Su Yu's voice came from the River of Time: "Topsoil!"

In the distance, the Topsoil Spirit, who was feeling alone, was slightly stunned and looked up at the sky.

Su Yu was repairing the mouth of the Celestial River of Death, and at this moment, Su Yu's figure was incomparably tall, his shadow projected across the heavens and the earth, like a divine being.

Su Yu stood in the air, repairing while casually saying, "If you're not afraid of death, come up now and repair the Five Elemental Dao with me. If you can successfully repair it... your Five Elemental Great Dao, unifying it won't be a problem! If you fail... you might find it difficult to reach Daofuse, and maybe... there's no hope. Wait for the next opportunity!"

Topsoil Spirit's expression changed, and below, the five ancestors of the Five Elemental Race all changed their expressions. The Fire Ancestor shouted, "Emperor Yu, is there danger for Topsoil to go up?"

"There is!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Repairing the Five Elements is even more painful than what I just endured. Even I can't bear it... Topsoil, consider it yourself! Fire burns, metal strikes, water attacks, wood transforms... maybe before you succeed in repairing, you'll be killed by this force of the Five Elements!"

Everyone had seen Su Yu's miserable state just now.

Could Topsoil Spirit compare to Su Yu?

Obviously not!

Not as strong, not as talented, not as insightful in the Great Dao!

If he went up, Su Yu might cry, and he might collapse.

At this moment, the Five Elemental Ancestors all changed their expressions, and the Water Ancestor was anxious, "Don't go up!"

Topsoil Spirit's expression changed, and the next moment, he soared into the sky, gritting his teeth, "I must go up. Ancestors, our race... cannot just decline like this. If I don't reach Daofuse, the Five Elements cannot unite, and our race... will never see another Daofuse! In this era of great contention, without a Daofuse, our race will only be obliterated in the long river of history!"

"Today, if Topsoil doesn't become Daofuse, then let me be buried in this River of Time, and let a new master of the Five Elements be born!"

I must go repair the Five Elemental Dao!

A race without a Daofuse, what kind of strong race is that?

The formidable power of the Five Elemental Ancestor was unparalleled in its time, and I... I will not remain weak forever!

He pressed on against the immense pressure, enduring the onslaught of river currents and chaotic forces, coughing up blood yet relentlessly striving toward the opening above. If he didn't reach the Daofuse Realm now, would there be another chance?

No, there wouldn't be!

If he missed this opportunity, the next time Su Yu paved the way, he would likely be unable to enter the Daofuse Realm. He would miss all opportunities unless he seized this one or perished here.

...

Within the River of Time.

Topsoil Spirit emerged, covered in blood, a vibrant array of colors. Meanwhile, Su Yu stood within the River of Time.

With a finger pointed at Topsoil Spirit's forehead, a small portal appeared there. Five divine characters emerged from Su Yu, and within that tiny opening, five broken lines faintly appeared.

Su Yu spoke calmly, "Brother Topsoil, success or failure hinges on this! I am giving you the opportunity and preparing everything for you. Here are five Great Daos. Follow my instructions to weave them into a loop around the breach. Once you succeed, let the Five Elemental Dao absorb the power of the five elements. If there are no signs of the river breaking, you can then enter the Daofuse Realm without difficulty!"

Topsoil Spirit asked solemnly, "What if I fail?"

"You make your own choice!" Su Yu frowned. "First, give up on the Daofuse Realm! Second, live peacefully with the Five Elemental Race. You've been with me for a while, and I won't treat you unfairly. But without the power of the Daofuse Realm, your race... from now on, might as well retire peacefully here!"

Topsoil Spirit felt a bitter taste. Retire?

What a joke!

In this era, would I really retire peacefully?

Gritting his teeth, he said, "Then I'll try. Unless I call for help... otherwise, don't assist me, even if... I perish here! I know you don't want me to die, but I want to try. Please, Emperor Yu, allow it! If I still can't succeed, please bury my Five Elemental Source in the Five Elemental Realm again, waiting for the next Five Elemental Lord to awaken!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. "Alright! Without a fight to the death, no one would be willing. I understand you!"

This was not mere consolation; it was genuine understanding.

Reaching Topsoil Spirit's level, would he be content to remain in the Eternal Realm forever?

Certainly not!

Especially now, with chaos in the Myriad Realms and geniuses emerging from every era, would he be content to remain the Eternal Realm's Five Elemental Lord?

"Thank you!"

Topsoil Spirit said no more and quickly began to repair the Five Elemental Dao. As soon as he touched it, a roaring sound erupted, and a force of flames scorched him. He tried to endure it, but this flame was different from what he controlled!

What he controlled was gentle, while this was the wild power of the Great Dao!

Previously, when he received it below, it was the Five Elemental power filtered twice by Su Yu and Lantian, not as wild. But now, Topsoil Spirit suddenly understood Su Yu.

He tried to hold it in, but... he really couldn't.

The next moment, a piercing scream echoed, "It hurts so much!"

"No... stop burning... ah!"

Topsoil Spirit screamed madly, the pain unbearable.

The fierce flames ignited the gentle flames within him, actually causing more pain than Su Yu, who had less Five Elemental power within him.

At this moment, Topsoil Spirit, while touching the Great Dao, screamed and rolled around madly!

"Stop burning... ah, save me... it hurts so much!"

The burning seemed to scorch his soul, his will, not just his physical body.

The next moment, a powerful sharp force emerged, and Topsoil Spirit's body collapsed. Instantly, a force of wood was born, helping him repair his body, repairing and destroying simultaneously!

"Ah!"

"Damn it!"

"Save me... sob sob sob..."

This scene projected across the entire Abyssal Realm, the small hole causing a massive shadow projection.

...

Only at this moment did everyone become extremely solemn.

Was it really this painful?

Su Yu had been sorting through myriad paths before, and it lasted a long time. Topsoil Spirit only touched it for a moment, just a simple Five Elemental Dao.

Was Topsoil Spirit weak?

No!

He was a prodigy of his generation, also the young lord of the Five Elemental Race. If he were useless, how could the Five Elemental Race follow him?

But at this moment, Topsoil Spirit was rolling on the ground, crying madly.

This made those who thought they might endure such pain feel a chill in their hearts.

In the River of Time, was taming the power of the Great Dao really this difficult?

And at this moment, suddenly, someone soared into the sky, "Emperor Yu, I want to go up and connect with the Blade Dao!"

Xia Longwu!

Having just entered the Daofuse Realm, Xia Longwu's expression was calm as he said loudly, "I want to go up and tame the broken Blade Dao. I want to comprehend this wild Blade Dao without Emperor Yu taming it for me, to feel the true power of the original Blade Dao!"

Yes, all Daos were tamed.

No matter what Dao, once opened by someone, it was domesticated.

Only in chaos, only in the waters of time, were those powers of the Great Dao wild, authentic natural Daos!

Su Yu remained silent.

Xia Longwu shouted again, "I want to comprehend the original Blade Dao, please, Emperor Yu, grant me this!"

Behind him, the Great Xia King’s face changed slightly.

His grandson wanted to comprehend the original Blade Dao!

And at this moment, a laugh echoed, "Your Majesty, I also want to comprehend the original power of the Dao!"

The Great Han King!

This Eternal Nine-stage powerhouse, with a smile, wanted to go up and take a look!

Because... he felt it was fine if he couldn't catch up with the Great Xia King, but now, being surpassed by the Great Xia King's grandson was unacceptable. The older generation also had their pride!

"Your Majesty, I want to go too!"

"Your Majesty..."

"......"

One by one, the powerhouses spoke up.

The next moment, Su Yu laughed, "Since none of you fear death, I'll grant you the chance to feel what the true original Dao is!"

Boom!

The sky cracked open, and a group of people quickly soared into the sky.

Su Yu opened the virtual Heaven Gates for each of them, pointing out the power of the Great Dao they wanted to continue!

A minute later.

"Ah!"

"Mom, mom save me..."

"Ah, it hurts..."

"Sob sob, Your Majesty, let me go... I don't want to comprehend anymore..."

"......"

A group of people cried and shouted madly, the pain unbearable.

It wasn't acting on the body, but the soul, the will, shattering your willpower!

The original Dao was just that powerful, that brutal.

And Su Yu, recording it, while recording, he sighed, "This is the first time living beings are taming the wild Great Dao, a precious video for future generations to remember. The original Dao is violent, brutal, targeting willpower, targeting the sea of will, targeting the soul... The pain on the body can be endured, but the pain on the soul, the spirit, is hard to control!"

He pointed a finger, and a light shone on Heavendoom, "This is Heavendoom, of the Explosive Divine Ape Race! At this moment, he is taming the wild Long Staff Dao. He has fallen, he is in pain, he is crying, he is begging for mercy... But we remember him, he is the strongest existence of the Explosive Divine Ape Race, taming the wild power of the Great Dao for future generations!"

"This one crying, begging for mercy, calling for his mother, is our Human Race's Great Ming King. After the Radiant King, he is taming the wild Array Dao... He cried, he is calling for his ancestor, the Radiant King, to save him..."

"This is Marquis Dingjun, an ancient marquis of the Human Race, alive for over a hundred thousand years. He is challenging the Long Spear Dao... Several people are challenging this Dao, the Great Qin King is challenging, the Great Qin King's son, Qin Zhen, is also challenging... Qin Zhen cried, he is calling for his father, the Great Qin King, to save him! Great Qin King, hold on, don't cry, your son is begging you, you have no one to beg... Marquis Dingjun is actually calling for his daughter to save him... My goodness, his daughter is only at the Sunmoon Realm!"

"......"

At this moment, below, Wan Tiansheng and a few others didn't go up, each shivering.

The revenge came so quickly.

We only watched, didn't record, and yet you not only recorded but also introduced each one in detail, what are you doing?

Can you be a person?

The Great Zhou King didn't go up, but he looked around and suddenly transmitted, "I think some people are acting! Quite a few are acting, once the act is over, this matter will pass, those of us who didn't go up... might still be retaliated against later!"

He believed that some were definitely acting!

Definitely!

Because not all Daos were that brutal, the Array Dao of the Great Ming King wasn't that brutal, yet look at the Great Ming King, screaming more miserably than anyone.

Bah!

The Zhu family has always been so shameless!

Wan Tiansheng couldn't help but laugh, but he spoke seriously, "Let's go up!"

His expression turned solemn, "Su Yu has created the best opportunity for us to comprehend the wild Great Dao, this is the original law! He even opened pseudo Heaven Gates for everyone, the opportunity is actually rare... It might be painful, but all the pressure, he is bearing it!"

Su Yu had a mountain on his shoulders!

A water mountain!

He alone was bearing the backflow of those river waters, at this moment, the Starry Sky Seal was about to explode from the pressure, the Mark of Civilization was about to burst from the river water, over a thousand of Su Yu's shadows were weaving a net!

Blocking these river waters, impacting those repairing the Great Dao.

And Su Yu himself, still smiling and recording.

Sometimes, cultivating doesn't need to be so painful, why bother, everyone should be happy, yet everyone understood, Su Yu was under immense pressure, once the Starry Sky Seal collapsed, the Mark of Civilization collapsed, Su Yu would inevitably suffer severe injuries!

The Great Zhou King saw this, nodded slightly, sighed, and suddenly transmitted with a smile, "Stubborn as a mule, this guy... always says, I'm done, I'm quitting, but... in the end, he still held up the sky, I believe, one day, he will become the Human Emperor! Even if not the second Human Emperor, he will be an emperor respected by all!"

At this moment, he firmly believed, Su Yu could become an emperor!

An emperor is not necessarily the strongest in martial power!

But an emperor must have the demeanor of an emperor.

Since the beginning of the world, the Human Race has only had one emperor, all those Martial Emperors are nonsense, Su Yu will become the second emperor!

This young man gradually grew up.

In his laughter and anger, he still shouldered some responsibilities, so ridiculous, yet it made people unable to laugh.

The next moment, the Great Zhou King soared into the sky, a smile on his face as he assisted in the restoration. But in the following instant, his scream was piercing, and Su Yu looked on with disdain.

Unable to hold back, Su Yu muttered, "This is the Great Zhou King, a sly old fox. He cultivates the Path of Endurance, and theoretically, the more primitive this path is, the more extreme his endurance should be. Even if his entire family were killed, he wouldn't utter a sound. Yet, he's screaming so miserably... what a fraud. I suspect he's cultivating the Path of Deception!"

Damn you!

The Great Zhou King's performance was over the top, leaving Su Yu feeling a lack of accomplishment and quite annoyed.

Take your acting seriously!

Around them, some people were screaming in pain, occasionally sneaking glances at the Great Zhou King. Damn it, you old fraud, since when does the Path of Endurance make you scream so miserably?

Indeed, this fraud is no good.

The Great Zhou King's expression was slightly stiff. The next moment, he continued to scream miserably. As long as he didn't admit it, no one could deny that his pain was genuine!

At this moment, what should have been an extremely dangerous and painful situation was turned into something bizarre by this group of people!

Some exchanged glances, smiles appearing in their eyes.

Cultivating the Dao, cultivating happiness is what matters!

Competing for supremacy, competing for joy is what counts!

On the path forward, the greatest fear is loneliness. With such a group of like-minded companions, at least the road ahead won't be lonely. How wonderful!

Boom!

A surge of energy rose up!

The first to participate in the restoration was the Topsoil Spirit. In this atmosphere, in this mood, he suddenly felt that it wasn't so painful anymore.

With a fierce roar, a surge of Five Elemental power instantly united!

Boom!

A powerful aura surged from his body, reaching the Daofuse Realm!

"The Five Elemental Race thanks Emperor Yu!"

The voice of the Topsoil Spirit was grand, echoing in all directions, followed by hearty laughter. The next moment, below, the five ancestors of the Five Elemental Race suddenly had their auras fluctuate, each one howling towards the sky, tears streaming down their faces!

Our race has produced a Daofuse!

It wasn't just about the Topsoil Spirit. When he stepped into the Daofuse Realm, the originally divergent Five Elemental Great Dao was forcibly unified by him.

The five ancestors of the Five Elemental Race, who had long reached the peak of the Eternal Realm, instantly stepped into the Daofuse Realm!

In the blink of an eye, the weakest Five Elemental Race suddenly gained six Daofuse Realm experts!

"Hahaha!"

Mad laughter echoed through the heavens and earth!

Today is a day of celebration for everyone, a day of victory!

At this moment, on the Human Lord Seal left by Su Yu in the Culture King's Residence, images suddenly appeared!

The Human Lord Seal was no longer just a Human Lord Seal!

At this moment, the domain images of the Space Ancient Beast Race, Five Elemental Race, Fate Clan, and Iron Devourer Race appeared, flickering continuously on the Human Lord Seal, with countless powers of fortune rising!

The Human Lord Seal, which had been somewhat difficult to suppress, now firmly suppressed the entire Culture King's Residence!

On the Human Lord Seal, the aura fluctuated unpredictably, and in the blink of an eye, golden patterns appeared!

At this moment, perhaps... it should be called the Emperor Yu Seal!

No longer limited to the Human Race!

...

Meanwhile, in a certain part of the endless void.

Suddenly, someone opened their eyes.

Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

His aura changed instantly, and in the blink of an eye, his power of fortune surged, and the strength of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis visibly increased.

He frowned, looking towards the direction of the submerged Abyssal Realm, his eyes filled with shock and confusion.

Su Yu... what has he done again?

A crushing defeat?

What a joke, this Su Yu guy seems to have won an unimaginably great victory!

An unbelievable victory!

"That fool Duobao... will never understand that these people can turn decay into magic..."

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis murmured, feeling it was unbelievable.

Su Yu was creating miracles again.

He clearly hadn't done anything, clearly just led people to retreat.

Why... would it be like this?

At this moment, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis suddenly felt that perhaps he really couldn't see through fortune!

"Su Yu... what a Su Yu!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis muttered, instantly closing his eyes, refusing to think further!
