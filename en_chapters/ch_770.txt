Chapter 770: Come and Kill Me

"Everyone is helping me. With so many allies, how could I fail? How could I possibly fail?"

Chains... they are often placed on you just like that.

In truth, Su Yu was not a saint, nor was he a selfless person. He was selfish and only wanted to live his own life, carefree and unrestrained in this vast Myriad Realms.

Open a path? If I fail once, I'll just try again. I'm not in a hurry! I'll find a place to hide for ten thousand years or so. If I don't succeed in opening a path, I won't come out!

What pen dao, what Human Emperor's path... strong as they may be, they are not mine. If one day the Culture King or the Human Emperor wants to take them back, wouldn't I just be working for someone else?

This is what Su Yu thought! As long as I become stronger, what path I take doesn't really matter. But Su Yu knew in his heart that these paths were not his, nor were they the most suitable for him. Others could give them to you if they wanted, and take them back whenever they pleased. It was too restrictive!

Inheriting the Human Emperor's path was something Su Yu was most reluctant to do. Yet today, at this moment, he told the Great Zhou King that if he failed to open his own path, he would inherit these paths.

Others might think Su Yu was being pretentious. If you fail, you can still inherit these great paths that others can only dream of. What more could you want?

But... I don't want to become someone else's puppet. I don't want to be called the second Culture King or the second Human Emperor. Everyone wants to live as themselves!

I want that too! Back then, when everyone said I was like the Culture King, I was not pleased. No, I am me. I am Su Yu. I am not the Culture King, nor do I want to become the second Culture King in everyone's eyes!

If someone wants to be a substitute, let them be! Even if I live a hard life, even if my strength is weak, I don't want to live as someone else.

Yet at this moment, Su Yu bowed to fate. He looked at the densely packed paths before him, filled with some longing, some hope. Let me succeed! I don't want to become someone else's shadow!

The paths were becoming more numerous. The third segment had already begun. The third segment, the Dao of Eternity. Actually, this was quite simple. The Dao of Eternity might seem very difficult, but the hardest part was time. In reality, as long as the path is perfected, the Dao of Eternity naturally forms, and time is within my path!

Time is the most elusive. Su Yu's concept is that time is unique, so the path of time is the only one within his path. There's no need to deliberately open it. Once the path is complete, time will be under my control!

I determine the beginning of time! I determine the year of time! If I say that one day now is a year in my path, in the new cosmos, then it is a year. Time is relative.

Therefore, this profound path doesn't require much comprehension from Su Yu. In fact, he can't comprehend it.

Currently, the most crucial thing for him is life and death.

"Life... from life to death, everyone can do that, but death, you can't truly die!"

"So should I open the path of life first or the path of death?"

At this moment, while merging other paths, Su Yu pondered.

Life and death are the hardest. A person's life is nothing more than life and death.

If I open the path of life first, then life comes before death. If the path of life is opened, and the path of death follows, then it will be difficult to be reborn from death.

As Su Yu was still contemplating, suddenly, a loud roar echoed!

Wan Tiansheng shouted angrily, "How dare you, courting death!"

In that instant, the entire chaos erupted with the power of the seven emotions and six desires. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, life and death cycles, all exploded.

In the dark chaos, Wan Tiansheng transformed into countless forms, drawing on the power of emotions to manipulate the chaos. With a single palm strike, a terrifying presence in the chaos, with some surprise and some confusion, was significantly affected. A powerful will swept over, "Who are you?"

That will was incredibly strong! A suppression of rank!

At this moment, everyone's expression changed. Near Su Yu, Marquis Dingjun muttered, "It feels... not weaker than the Hundred Battle King!"

Not weaker than the Hundred Battle King from six thousand years ago!

At that time, the Hundred Battle King had already touched the realm of the power of laws.

Back then, the Hundred Battle King could fight three Heavenly Sovereigns without difficulty.

Of course, Yueqin was killed by Wan Tiansheng and Lantian, but that was because two Heavenly Kings self-destructed to kill her, and they had to add Su Yu and Fat Ball to finally take her down.

In comparison, perhaps ten Heavenly Kings could match this opponent.

However, what is a Heavenly Sovereign?

A Heavenly Sovereign represents the comprehension of the Great Dao and the power of laws without any difference. There would be no suppression of rank between them, but a Heavenly King facing a ruler of laws would face a suppression of rank.

In the void, a powerful presence gradually revealed its true form.

Su Yu glanced at it and suddenly sighed, smiling, "Luck, is it?"

Opening the heavens must come with difficulties! There must be obstacles!

This presence suddenly appeared, and Su Yu felt it was not unexpected.

At this moment, Su Yu collected his thoughts and looked at the massive beast forced out in the distance. It was enormous, somewhat resembling a dragon, perhaps the prototype of the dragon race.

Su Yu smiled, his willpower fluctuating, "How did you come out?"

It couldn't be a coincidence! It must be the arrangement of chaos.

The dragon-like beast also looked at Su Yu, its massive eyes emitting a faint golden glow in the darkness.

"Are you opening a path in chaos?"

"Indeed!"

"No wonder!"

The dragon beast's willpower swept over, "Chaos is summoning me. I have long been asleep, but chaos is summoning me to deal with you, the one opening a path!"

It was the will of chaos that summoned it. It hadn't sensed anything; it had long been asleep, deep within the chaos.

Su Yu sighed, "Chaos... it seems even the heavens have a will! This is deliberately preventing me from opening the heavens here... Other ancient beasts might have sensed the repulsion, but you, even a slumbering existence, have been dug out! Do you want to kill me?"

"Driving you away is also fine!"

The dragon beast's willpower trembled, "If you leave the chaos, I won't kill you!"

Its massive eyes scanned the surroundings. There were still some strong individuals.

Fat Ball, Wan Tiansheng, these people were all quite powerful. However, Lantian was seriously injured, and the Great Zhou King and South King had left.

At this moment, in terms of combat power, they were still inferior to this being.

Even if Heavenly Kings joined forces!

As for those below Heavenly King, at this point, it's not just about numbers. As the Martial Emperor once said, if it were about numbers, wouldn't three to five Daofuse Realm cultivators be enough to kill him?

A single Heavenly King fighting four or five Daofuse Realm cultivators, seven or eight Heavenly Kings could be equivalent to two or three Heavenly Sovereigns. Two or three Heavenly Sovereigns could match the sealed Martial Emperor, could they kill him?

But the suppression of rank exists.

Even if ants can bite an elephant to death, it depends on time and opportunity.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng's emotions erupted, carrying strong goodwill, his willpower fluctuating, "Mighty one, as long as you are willing to retreat, we can trade. Whatever you need, we can trade!"

He hoped to avoid a great battle! Otherwise, the trouble would be immense!

But the dragon beast, with some mockery, said, "What can you offer me?"

A ridiculous bunch!

Its massive body slowly moved forward.

And Su Yu, with a smile, said, "This is a test, a punishment, chaos's punishment for me. Opening the heavens isn't that simple! Well, I was just about to open the path of life and death, and I was wondering, how do I die? Should I commit suicide? That wouldn't be appropriate!"

Su Yu chuckled, "The timing is perfect! It's a disaster, but also an opportunity! From life to death, reborn from death... Look, this ancient beast has come. It's actually a trial stone for my path! If I get killed, it just fits the path of death! From life to death... If I return, I can fight it, and I won't necessarily fear it!"

Su Yu sighed, "Everything is arranged perfectly. Luck, this thing is indeed terrifying!"

He looked at the dragon beast and smiled, "I've killed many dragons, but I've never killed one as powerful as you! In ancient times, could you match the rulers of laws?"

The dragon beast did not underestimate Su Yu. It could ignore Wan Tiansheng and the others, but it could not ignore this being who was opening the heavens.

It was silent for a moment, then suddenly spoke, no longer using willpower to communicate, but speaking in the universal language of the Myriad Realms.

"The ancient times you speak of, is it the era when the Human Race was unified?"

"Yes."

"Ruler of laws..."

The chaos dragon thought for a moment and said, "I once fought with your Human Race's King, but I was no match for him, and he couldn't kill me. I escaped."

"Which King?"

Su Yu was a bit curious. Which King couldn't kill this being that was barely stepping into the realm of the rulers of laws?

"King Ping!"

Su Yu was taken aback and looked at Marquis Dingjun.

If he remembered correctly, Marquis Dingjun was under King Ping.

And Marquis Dingjun looked somewhat embarrassed.

At this moment, not far from Su Yu, Consort Qi transmitted her voice, "In ancient times, to see if a King was strong, you could look at the strength of his subordinates! King Ping didn't have many strong subordinates, so even Marquis Dingjun could get a marquis position! King Ping, as his name suggests, was average in strength, a typical King of the physical path! Not a true ruler of laws, just someone whose combat power reached that level!"

Goodness, she just exposed King Ping's background.

Marquis Dingjun and General Yingwu were of similar strength. Well, maybe General Yingwu was even stronger, and one was a general, the other a marquis... perhaps because each King had different quotas.

Strong as the Culture King and Martial King were, they had many quotas, but with many talents under them, it was hard to distribute.

But for people like King Ping, even though they had fewer quotas, they also had fewer strong subordinates, making it easier to distribute.

Marquis Dingjun getting a marquis position was considered lucky.

After subtly humiliating King Ping and Marquis Dingjun, Su Yu laughed, "So, you couldn't even match the weakest of the physical path Kings back then?"

In that case, this guy wasn't much in ancient times.

The dragon beast wasn't angry, just coldly said, "Do you want to fight me?"

Su Yu laughed, "If you don't mind, can you wait for me a bit?"

Su Yu pointed to the thousands of paths in front of him, "I haven't fully merged with these paths yet. Can you wait until I've merged them?"

The giant dragon beast seemed somewhat displeased. Su Yu chuckled and said, "Give me a moment! I won't bully you by having my people join in and gang up on you. Otherwise, you might not come out on top!"

He glanced around. "I have quite a few people here! If they all attack together, you might not be able to hold your ground! Wait for me to finish merging my dao, and then we can have a one-on-one duel. How about it?"

The giant dragon beast also looked around, noticing the number of people present. Even if it could kill many, it wouldn't come out unscathed.

At this moment, the giant dragon beast fell silent for a while before speaking, "You can retreat."

"That's not possible. That would hinder my path to proving the dao, and I won't agree to that!" Su Yu laughed. "Are you willing? If not... then let's start the battle now!"

The giant dragon beast fell silent once more. "Will your people join forces with you later?"

Su Yu smiled. "They won't! Opening the path of life and death requires a leap of faith. If my people intervene, my path might be severed! If the path is broken, I'll retreat... So if my people intervene and I lose, you're the winner!"

Opening the path of life and death! A leap of faith.

The giant dragon beast pondered for a moment. It wasn't sure if Su Yu was telling the truth, but if Su Yu tried any tricks, it still had a chance to crush him and prevent him from continuing his path.

How should it decide?

After some contemplation, the giant dragon beast said, "You probably don't want your subordinates to die either... If you truly fight me one-on-one, I'm willing to wait for you! But if you gang up on me... I'll retreat now, but I will definitely seek revenge!"

Su Yu laughed, "Are you threatening me?"

"Are you going to break your promise?"

Su Yu chuckled, "I won't! How about this, you tell those ancient beasts not to come either, wait for me a bit, half a day should be enough, and then I'll spar with you after merging other daos!"

The giant dragon beast said nothing.

Su Yu didn't care and continued merging his dao. Pages of compendiums flew out, rapidly expanding, opening up a grand path.

Su Yu also merged quickly. Thanks to Lantian's earlier experiments, Su Yu's merging process was much smoother.

Two thousand paths, twenty-one hundred paths...

One by one, the power of the grand paths was woven into a net, making the entire path robust and increasingly powerful.

These powers of the grand paths were vaguely connected to Su Yu.

Su Yu's aura gradually grew stronger.

However, it was still not very harmonious.

Wan Tiansheng appeared, transmitting his voice, "Are you really going to fight it one-on-one?"

"Yes."

Su Yu transmitted back, "I want to comprehend life and death, true life and death, to be reborn from the brink of death! Don't worry, I'm not that easy to kill. I'm opening the path, even if I die... if I open the path of life, I can live!"

Wan Tiansheng was silent for a moment, then transmitted, "If you really can't win, we'll join forces!"

"No!"

Su Yu laughed, transmitting again, "I've deceived many times, but this time I'm not deceiving this giant dragon! There's no need for unnecessary sacrifice! If I can't win, and the path of life and death can't be opened, this path is probably wasted! Unless I succeed in opening the path and still can't defeat it... if it continues to cause trouble, then we can show it some color!"

He continued, "This giant dragon is actually a test for my path opening! This time, the path opening is incredibly smooth, but smoothness often indicates some shortcomings, which may not be a good thing! Prefect, you all should retreat first!"

Wan Tiansheng frowned, saying nothing.

Su Yu, however, spoke loudly, "Everyone, retreat to the Land of the Abyss! Later, I'll have a duel with this dragon friend to practice my new path. You all can watch, maybe it will give you some insights!"

Everyone looked at each other, not saying a word for a moment.

Su Yu's expression turned cold, "Or are you saying my words no longer hold weight?"

Upon hearing this, Wan Tiansheng sighed and turned to fly back.

The others also silently flew towards the Land of the Abyss.

This dragon was not weak!

It was comparable to the Hundred Battle King from six thousand years ago, or perhaps not weaker than the ancestor of the Chaos Race, or maybe even on par with or stronger than the Sunmoon Heavenly Sovereign of the God Race.

These people, from different periods, might be considered the same level, the pinnacle of a Heavenly Sovereign, the threshold of a ruler of laws.

In a state of half-broken, not broken.

Of course, the current Hundred Battle King might be stronger, having sealed himself for six thousand years, he might not have stopped cultivating.

"If I can match you, it means I can catch up to the Hundred Battle King from six thousand years ago... I don't believe he hasn't made any progress in six thousand years!"

As an emperor, Su Yu didn't care much about demeanor.

As for methods, everyone had plenty.

What he lacked now was strength.

Even if he didn't open the path of life and death, he could still exert considerable strength. Once opened, the result would be seen.

Two thousand three hundred paths, two thousand four hundred paths...

The grand paths continued to merge.

Su Yu's aura gradually grew stronger.

An illusory strength!

It hadn't truly become a cohesive force!

Opposite, the giant dragon beast remained silent, watching quietly. Path openers were legends even in chaos.

Now, it also wanted to try fighting a weaker path opener.

What ability does a path opener have to open the path?

Time passed bit by bit, about four or five hours later, the entire void was eerily quiet.

Boom!

At this moment, the grand path tightened!

Like a cylinder, but this cylinder seemed to be cut in half, divided into a bamboo split open.

These two points needed two paths to connect.

Su Yu felt it, and was quite satisfied. This time was actually quite smooth, of course, Lantian was heavily injured, and the injuries to the grand path might not heal easily.

At this moment, the phenomenon of path opening hadn't appeared yet!

Because it was incomplete!

The giant dragon beast had been waiting all this time, and now it knew Su Yu was probably ready, its voice like a great bell, "Are you ready?"

"Ready, thank you for your patience, friend!"

Su Yu laughed, taking steps forward, "Friend, take it easy, my path is still not mature..."

Boom!

A tail swept over directly, shattering the void.

Su Yu vanished instantly, reappearing above the giant dragon's head, silently comprehending, and softly said, "The grand paths are indeed profound, friend, it seems you might not be able to kill me!"

"Only strength is true!"

The giant dragon beast didn't care, it had seen the power of the grand paths before.

The next moment, a surge of chaotic power rose, and in an instant, Su Yu was surrounded by chaotic power, with a boom, the chaotic power exploded!

Su Yu vanished again, but this time, he felt a sense of crisis.

The giant dragon was extremely fast!

It followed closely, catching up in an instant.

Su Yu immediately drew the surrounding chaotic power, but it had little effect on the giant dragon.

"Strength is not broken, strength comes from oneself, not necessarily from chaos... Underestimating me is not a good thing!"

Bang!

A tail swept over, Su Yu vanished again, but this time, the power of vanishing was directly suppressed by a massive force, and the next moment, a massive dragon roar echoed through the heavens and earth!

"Roar!"

Boom!

Su Yu's eardrums burst, blood flowed from his seven orifices, and he fell out of the vanishing state.

Pfft!

A mouthful of blood spurted out.

"No matter how many skills you have, one force can break ten techniques. The ancient Chaos Race, after all, is the beginning of this universe!"

With that, silently, a giant claw reached for Su Yu, with a pfft, smashing Su Yu into pieces.

In the distance, a group of people panicked.

The next moment, Su Yu appeared again, one, two, three...

The path of avatars!

The giant dragon's eyes flashed with cold light, "Avatars? Does it matter?"

"Break!"

A low shout, the giant dragon's body instantly expanded a million times, the entire chaotic space seemed to be filled with the giant dragon, with a boom, it suppressed down, filling the entire space!

Bang, bang, bang, one Su Yu after another exploded!

Truly, one force can break ten techniques!

And Su Yu's voice echoed in all directions, with a sense of lament, "I've read books since I was young, where the protagonist uses one force to break ten techniques, and after killing someone, says that fancy moves are useless. I didn't expect to be taught a lesson by you today! So, you're the protagonist, and I'm the villain?"

Su Yu's voice carried a smile, "The so-called one force breaking ten techniques is just a warrior gilding themselves! At the same level, do you think fancy moves are useful or not, friend?"

At this moment, Su Yu transformed into a fire of chaos, instantly illuminating the heavens and earth, burning the giant dragon!

"The power of laws is not strong! Indeed, it's just fancy!"

Boom!

The giant dragon swung its tail, extinguishing the firelight, its giant claw shattered the void, breaking through the firmament, piercing through the chaos, scattering Su Yu's shadow, and Su Yu vanished instantly.

One man and one dragon began a fierce battle in the void.

Su Yu focused on evasion, using various dao techniques in endless succession.

Invisibility, Five Elements, Avatars, Curses, Explosions...

Various dao techniques were used continuously.

However, no matter how strong the dao techniques were, they only created small wounds on the giant dragon, which quickly healed, while each attack from the giant dragon caused Su Yu to suffer a little.

The giant dragon beast said coldly, "Your dao is too weak! At this rate, you might fail!"

Su Yu's figure appeared again, somewhat pale, smiling, "Indeed! As expected, you guys at this level are really hard to deal with!"

"Fight!"

Su Yu instantly transformed into a large blade, the Blade of Path Opening, the blade light spread, and between heaven and earth, there was only this blade!

"Not enough!"

The giant dragon beast suddenly roared, the sound waves shook the heavens and earth, behind, Wan Tiansheng and the others changed color, one after another, defensive shields rose, boom, boom, boom, one after another, defensive shields shattered!

Pfft, many people spat blood simultaneously.

And Su Yu, transformed into a long blade, dimmed significantly, slashing down with a loud bang, striking the dragon's horn, golden blood trickled from the horn, and Su Yu, returning to his original form, retreated several thousand meters, his hands bloody and mangled.

The giant dragon shook its head, a smile in its eyes, "Is this your strongest attack?"

Too weak!

Su Yu sighed, am I weak?

Not weak at all!

At this moment, he stood amidst a convergence of thousands of Great Daos. While he couldn't claim to rival a Master of Laws, he felt he had at least attained the power of a Heavenly Sovereign. On that day, he could have matched the likes of that Moon Harp. Yet, against this colossal dragon, no matter how many methods he employed, he found it difficult to break through its defenses. What could he do?

"Your attack power is insufficient!" The dragon chuckled. "How about trying mine?"

In the next instant, the dragon suddenly spiraled upward!

"Collapse!"

A thunderous shout of willpower echoed in all directions. With a deafening roar, the surrounding void suddenly shattered. The dragon's spiraling body exploded like a spring!

The entire chaotic void was shattered by its explosive force!

Rumble!

Space tore apart as Su Yu swiftly concealed himself, but it was futile; he was instantly exposed. His clones shattered in the blink of an eye. Even when his true form turned to nothingness, it was no use; he was forced back to his original form.

With a single explosive strike, Su Yu exhausted all his methods. It was incredibly difficult, but with a loud bang, he reappeared ten thousand meters away from the dragon, his body covered in blood and wounds.

"Huff..."

Su Yu panted heavily, filled with helplessness.

Damn, this guy is formidable! If it were to fight a Heavenly Sovereign, it could probably take on three or four at once!

He had almost no chance to fight back, relying solely on his myriad methods to survive.

Just as he was contemplating, his hair stood on end. Su Yu tore through the void to escape, but at that moment, a tail silently trailed behind him, moving at an unimaginable speed. With a piercing sound, the tail's tip pierced through Su Yu's chest.

Su Yu roared, unleashing the power of the Great Dao, disappearing in an instant. When he reappeared, his expression changed. Before him, a burly figure suddenly appeared!

Bare-chested, the figure threw a punch!

Boom!

Su Yu quickly crossed his arms to block, but with a loud bang, his arms exploded. His chest suffered another severe blow, and he was sent flying, his bones shattering.

As he flew backward, the burly figure appeared again, flashing behind Su Yu and delivering a kick. With a bang, Su Yu's back exploded as if he were a ball being kicked!

"Your Majesty!"

Behind him, everyone was shocked. How powerful!

This burly figure was the dragon in its beast form.

The burly figure's kick severely injured Su Yu. It followed closely, saying, "I told you, no matter how many methods you have, they can't compare to true strength!"

"Culture King!" Su Yu suddenly shouted, his voice filled with shock. A white-robed figure suddenly appeared before him. The dragon glanced over, startled!

Instinctively, it paused for a moment. Suddenly, golden light burst from its eyes, and chaotic energy erupted, shattering the white phantom. When it looked again, Su Yu had already fled to a distant place.

Su Yu panted, blood streaming from his seven orifices, yet he laughed. "Who says having many methods is useless? Look, if I were just a bit stronger, or if we were evenly matched, I could have killed you the moment you were distracted! Old dragon, you're too outdated. Comparing pure strength... isn't that just barbaric?"

"However... strength is strength!"

The burly figure stepped through the air, coldly saying, "Having many methods is indeed beneficial. At equal strength, the one with more methods has a greater chance of winning! But... you and I are not equal! Now, if you abandon your Great Dao and retreat, I won't kill you!"

Su Yu chuckled, disappearing in the blink of an eye. In an instant, hundreds of figures appeared around the dragon. The dragon's eyes gleamed with divine light, and with a punch, all the phantoms exploded!

"Lock!"

A low shout rang out. As the phantoms exploded, they suddenly locked the opponent. Su Yu's true form appeared, his face pale, holding a pen in the air. "Five Elements Purgatory, Seal the Heavens and Earth, Suppress the Demons..."

Each word was a divine character, each word a rule!

"Only strength is real!"

The burly figure roared madly, divine characters shattered, chains broke, and with a loud boom, a leg swept through the void. With a bang, the giant pen in Su Yu's hand broke, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Su Yu's face grew even paler, unable to help but curse, "You're just at the boundary, not a true Master of Laws, yet you're this strong?"

"You're not weak either!" The dragon said calmly. "Having many methods is indeed advantageous. Otherwise, with your level of strength, you would have been dead in a direct confrontation with me! The fact that you can counterattack already makes you a strong opponent!"

"Master of Laws?" The burly figure smiled. "At my level, if I were to connect with the power of the Great Dao in your Myriad Realms, I would be a Master of Laws. What's real and what's fake? Why bind myself with shackles and become a slave to the Myriad Realms?"

Before he finished speaking, both Su Yu and the dragon attacked simultaneously. Su Yu slashed down with a blade, while the dragon punched out. Boom!

This might have been their first direct collision. Su Yu's blade broke, but it instantly released a poisonous gas.

Sizzle!

The sound of corrosion rang out. The dragon felt slightly dizzy, and black blood oozed from its fist. With a shake of its hand, the black blood dripped, corroding even the chaotic energy!

"Poison?" The dragon frowned. "You really have many methods. How many more do you know?"

"Plenty more!" Su Yu sneered. In the blink of an eye, a healing power emerged, and his injuries healed instantly.

Moments later, dozens of barriers appeared around him, all defensive powers.

Then, phantoms appeared in the void, attacking the dragon. They seemed like gods, like demons, a summoning technique!

"Condense qi into puppets!"

A low shout, countless chaotic qi transformed into human figures, attacking the dragon.

At this moment, Su Yu unleashed all his methods.

"Scatter beans to form soldiers!"

With a wave of his hand, countless puppets appeared, but the dragon had already shattered all the puppets.

"Wasting the power of laws, these puppets can only delay me for a moment. What can they do?"

"Accumulate little to make much, to kill you!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, countless puppets appeared again. This time, they all self-destructed, causing the surroundings to tremble. But when the explosion subsided, the dragon emerged again, only slightly disheveled, with a few small wounds that quickly healed.

Su Yu was also powerless!

Damn it, even this couldn't harm the opponent. This was impossible to fight!

...

On the periphery.

Everyone watched, dazzled and terrified. Heavendoom couldn't help but say, "Your Majesty, use the big stick to hit him!"

At that moment, Su Yu transformed into a giant stick and struck down!

Boom!

The dragon punched out, shattering the stick, and Su Yu was sent flying.

A group of people glared angrily at Heavendoom, who looked helpless. How was he supposed to know this would happen? Wasn't his big stick path strong?

It felt weaker than other paths!

Heavendoom couldn't help but ask, "What level of strength does His Majesty have?"

It was hard to discern.

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "Heavenly Sovereign!"

"Then His Majesty should open the Path of Life and Death and hit him!"

Without opening the Path of Life and Death, he already had the power of a Heavenly Sovereign. If he opened it, wouldn't he instantly become a Master of Laws?

Hit him!

Wan Tiansheng wanted to tear his mouth apart!

Nonsense, if he could open it, Su Yu would have done so already!

At that moment, the dragon stepped forward again, its massive foot stomping toward Su Yu. "You want to comprehend life and death through my power... I'm afraid it's difficult! I won't kill you, but I will shatter your myriad Daos. Even if you comprehend life and death, what then?"

"Chaos beast, you're quite clever..."

Su Yu retreated again, quickly escaping, smiling bitterly. "No wonder, I felt you were always depleting my Great Dao power. Turns out it was to sever my Dao!"

The dragon didn't deny it. It had already said so itself, and that was indeed the case!

Why bother killing Su Yu?

Sever his Dao, sever his hopes, and today's matter would be over.

Killing Su Yu would only spark a great war.

"But... you also need to see if I'm willing to exhaust myself with you!"

"You lack the ability to kill me, so I am unafraid!"

The dragon had just finished speaking when Su Yu roared. Suddenly, the Heaven Gate opened!

With the Heaven Gate open, Su Yu's entire state changed. Looking at the dragon again, he saw flaws all over its body. His speed increased, and in the blink of an eye, he traversed the void, thrusting a sword!

With a piercing sound, it struck the opponent's left arm. With a piercing sound, the sword pierced through the muscle gap, penetrating its arm.

"Heaven Gate?"

The dragon trembled slightly. "You're forcing me to kill you..."

"In battle, the worst mistake is holding back. Even a lion uses all its strength to hunt a rabbit, let alone I'm not a rabbit. Do you really think you can exhaust me to death?"

Su Yu sneered.

"Then I'll fulfill your wish!"

The dragon transformed back into its massive form, enormous beyond measure.

"Collapse!"

The surrounding void shattered again. This time, Su Yu didn't retreat. As the power of the Great Dao shattered, he traversed the weak points of the force, thrusting a sword. With a piercing sound, the sword pierced the dragon's eye.

"Roar!"

The dragon roared madly, spewing chaotic flames. Su Yu was instantly engulfed in flames, and a large amount of water power appeared, but it couldn't extinguish the flames.

"Ah!"

Su Yu screamed in pain, his long sword transforming into a spear. With a sweep, he shattered the dragon's horn again, droplets of blood falling, black poison continuously seeping.

In the blink of an eye, this man and dragon were locked in fierce combat in the void.

Su Yu had too many methods, but his strength was still lacking.

Before long, Su Yu was torn apart by a claw, his flesh flying, torn apart by the dragon!

"Your Majesty!"

Behind him, everyone couldn't bear it any longer. Someone shouted, "Fight alongside him, kill that guy!"

The gap was evident; Su Yu couldn't match the opponent at all.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng remained calm, transmitting his voice, "Wait! He wants to die once, to truly be killed by the opponent, to test the outcome of death... don't interfere with him!"

Everyone was apprehensive. If he died, could he really come back to life?

It felt too crazy!

Rumble!

At this moment, Su Yu charged forward again, filled with a reckless abandon, his voice echoing, "I've tried countless times to fake death, each time feeling like true death... but waking up knowing it was all a dream!"

"Fellow Daoist, fulfill me, come and kill me!"

Rumble!

A Heavenly Sovereign unafraid of death, using countless methods, even the dragon couldn't hold back now.

Its power grew stronger and stronger.

"You're courting death. Do you really think if you die, you can be resurrected?"

"Kill!"

A mighty roar erupted from the dragon as a round pearl suddenly appeared in its claw, hurling straight at Su Yu!

With a resounding crash, Su Yu's body was torn apart!

Just as his shattered form attempted to regenerate, the dragon moved even faster, appearing beside his fragmented body in the blink of an eye, its foot aiming to crush his head!

"You seek death? Then let me grant it to you!"

Boom!

As the massive foot descended, it transformed into a dragon tail, thrusting like a spear, ready to pierce Su Yu to death!

At that moment, Su Yu's mouth suddenly opened wide, roaring, "I'll swallow you!"

His mouth expanded to an unbelievable size, engulfing the entire dragon tail in one gulp.

Though his abdomen had already exploded, the dragon's tail was nowhere to be seen, swallowed into some unknown abyss!

A tremendous devouring force pulled the dragon into his mouth.

Rumble!

A thunderous noise echoed, and the dragon's voice emerged from an unknown place, "You think you can swallow me? Dream on..."

"Screw you!"

Su Yu gritted his teeth, his head alone floating in the air. Suddenly, a Heaven Gate appeared above his head, descending to the ground and transforming into a portal.

"Even if I wish to die, it won't be by your hand, not like this. If you kill me so easily, then I, Su Yu, am truly worthless!"

He charged headfirst into the Heaven Gate!

The ethereal gate opened, and in an instant, his head plunged inside!

The dragon roared in madness, "Heaven Gate? Are you insane? Beware, neither of us may return..."

Boom!

A colossal sound reverberated through the heavens and earth as Su Yu's head crashed into the gate, shattering instantly. In that moment, Su Yu felt as if he truly experienced death.

Inside the Heaven Gate, it seemed like a realm of darkness.

Was it the darkness of death, or was the Heaven Gate itself a land of shadows?

"Culture King!"

At this moment, Su Yu seemed to recall something, letting out a final roar.

"Are you there?"

"Culture King!"

"Are you there?"

Rumble!

His last cry echoed, and Su Yu's head disintegrated, revealing a giant dragon, its body covered in wounds, fear etched across its face as it turned to flee from the gate.

At that very moment, as Su Yu's consciousness faded, a distant voice seemed to emerge from the dark realm.

"Huh? Who?"

"A dragon?"

"A dragon opening the Heaven Gate?"

The voice carried a hint of confusion and awe. What madness!

Boom!

The dragon roared in frenzy, uncertain if Su Yu was dead or if he had heard anything, but it had heard!

A terrifying world!

It burned its body with wild abandon, crashing through the ethereal Heaven Gate in an instant, but the gate suddenly exploded, boom!

Half of the dragon's tail was severed, left behind within the gate.

Yet the dragon's head managed to escape!

Bang!

The Heaven Gate shattered, the sole source of light vanished.

The world fell into silence once more.

...

In the land of darkness.

A man in white looked on in amazement at the blood-soaked giant beside him. "Did you hear that?"

"What?"

"Someone called me! It sounded like... a dragon!"

The giant frowned, glancing at him before suddenly cursing, "Are you crazy? Wouldn't it make more sense if your sister called you?"

"No, it wasn't..."

The man in white wanted to argue, but it wasn't his sister... Forget it, he soon gave up.

A sense of sorrow washed over him!

If only the Human Emperor were here, or the Radiant King, or even the Control King, they would be astonished by what I said, and then suggest, "Really? Let's investigate, find out the reason, analyze it..."

Well, that's them!

But now, my companions aren't them.

The man in white was utterly dejected, "I'm sorry, I've spoiled you!"

"Hmm?"

The giant looked at him, and the man in white lamented, "Besides fighting and killing, think more in the future. Raising you is harder than raising a son!"

"......"

The giant's face turned livid!

Who are you insulting?

The man in white ignored him, gazing into the distance. I want to see, I really... it seemed like someone called me!

It seemed like a dragon... strange, a dragon?

A Chaos Dragon?

I wasn't seeing things, I believe it!
