Chapter 760: Migration and Digging (10,000 Words for Subscription)

Su Yu was willing to fight back! Since he was willing, he was indeed a good Human Lord... Well, that's how everyone felt. I don't know Hundred Battle, who knows what his situation is.

At this moment, everyone's morale was high! Su Yu was also in high spirits... but after the excitement, he felt helpless and transmitted his voice, "A bunch of bastards, are you doing this on purpose? If Hundred Battle really cared about you, you'd forget what you said before. It's just to fool people. Fortunately, I'm a reliable scholar!"

Everyone was fervent, even Xia Huyou and the others were excited as if something big was happening.

Su Yu thought carefully... Forget it! He knew very well what each of them was thinking.

Because they were about to evacuate, after all, people's hearts were unsettled. Those leaving and those staying were all somewhat anxious. They worried about the future, worried if staying would lead to retaliation, worried if they left, would they ever return?

Today, after a forced palace meeting and a conversation... actually... most of it was an act.

Su Yu glanced at the Great Shang King, who appeared indifferent and calm, as if he hadn't been the one passionately rousing everyone just moments ago.

Seeing Su Yu's gaze, the Great Shang King felt a bit uneasy and transmitted his voice, "I was just trying to boost everyone's morale, Emperor Yu, don't look at me!"

What he said was seventy percent true and thirty percent false. He truly didn't want Hundred Battle as the Human Lord and truly wanted to fight back, but... if they couldn't fight back... then so be it.

They would bide their time and see how Su Yu fared. To put it bluntly, if Su Yu ended up dead without reclaiming the Human Realm... well, it wouldn't be many years. By then, if Hundred Battle truly loved the people like his children, they could return.

And if Su Yu didn't die, it meant he had become a master of the power of laws, and of course, he could reclaim the Human Realm. If not, a master of the power of laws was enough to dominate the world.

Yes, everyone calculated it so clearly. The earlier words were mainly to reassure the people. Otherwise, what if those staying felt abandoned by Su Yu?

Su Yu had been busy recently and hadn't had time to reassure the people. Everyone helped, but it wasn't enough. Today, Su Yu himself had to say something.

We'll evacuate first and then return. Wait for us! Don't worry!

The various prefects had guarded the Human Realm for over four hundred years, and they had a foundation. No matter how powerful Hundred Battle was, it would take decades or even a hundred years to win people's hearts.

Su Yu glanced at him and couldn't be bothered to say more. Just moments ago, he had been so passionate, making everyone think the Great Shang King was a hot-blooded hero... who would believe that?

The Great Shang King was very cautious, unlike the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King.

Nearby, the Great Han King remained expressionless.

Su Yu didn't say much more. Some things depended on timing. If they could truly fight back, it didn't matter. He felt that he and Hundred Battle would have a showdown sooner or later. If he truly defeated Hundred Battle, wouldn't the Human Realm still be his?

So, those words just now were said and done. Any hesitation, any doubt, any conflict... there was some, but there was also an element of acting.

"Everyone, go in. I will definitely bring everyone back to the Human Realm as soon as possible!"

With a loud shout from Su Yu, everyone seemed invigorated, with no trace of sadness. We will return!

Everyone entered one after another.

However... after waiting for a while, Su Yu frowned slightly.

Suddenly looking at Xia Huyou and the others, Su Yu furrowed his brows and looked at Xia Huyou a few more times. Xia Huyou, however, remained calm. Seeing Su Yu's gaze, he flew forward and whispered, "I'm not leaving. I'm not deceiving everyone. I truly won't leave!"

Su Yu was stunned, then frowned, "What do you mean?"

Wasn't it just an act before?

Xia Huyou bowed slightly, "What I said was all true! I want to stay, not to perish with everyone, nor for any other reason. I just want to fulfill some responsibilities for the Xia family! The billions of citizens of the Great Xia Prefecture trust the Xia family... the Xia family cannot all evacuate!"

"My father can leave, my second uncle can leave... they are strong and will become thorns in the eye, but I am just a weakling who has just stepped into the Sunmoon Realm!"

"If I stay... Hundred Battle won't kill me, and I can ensure the Great Xia Prefecture remains stable!"

"If Hundred Battle forcibly takes me down, he will completely lose the people's hearts. If he wants to win the people's hearts, he still needs me to reassure the citizens of the Great Xia Prefecture..."

Su Yu frowned deeply.

After a long while, he slowly said, "Do you know that if you stay, your strength won't progress in the short term! And if I truly fight back, and Hundred Battle uses you to threaten me..."

Xia Huyou laughed, looking at Su Yu, suddenly smiling brightly, "If it truly comes to that, let him kill me! If he doesn't even have the courage to face you and uses a weakling to threaten you... are you still afraid of him? Then he's finished! If I die, you can come to the Celestial River of Death to bring me back! Because... I want to live!"

"Su Yu, would you fear a Hundred Battle who uses me to threaten you?"

His smile was radiant, "If Hundred Battle is truly a hero, he won't be so childish! If he is, then he's a real fool... what is there to fear?"

What is there to fear!

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then suddenly laughed, looking at him, "We've... all grown up!"

Four years!

From the day they entered the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy to now, it had been four years.

Four years ago, when he first met Xia Huyou, he said he was a janitor, a little merchant, and Su Yu was also a guy full of schemes.

Four years later, their strengths were different, their experiences were different.

But they had truly grown up.

Xia Huyou understood what responsibility was, what it meant to bear it. He wanted to stay and be responsible for the remaining citizens of the Great Xia Prefecture.

A few years ago, Xia Huyou wouldn't have done this.

Xia Huyou smiled, "There is always a time of youth. Over the years, we've fought big battles, small battles, lost face, played tricks, done all sorts of things! In the end, looking back, it's a different feeling in the heart!"

His smile was as bright as before, "After all, I am a member of the Xia family, the prefect of the Great Xia Prefecture. The Great Xia Prefecture has not failed the Xia family, how can I let the Xia family fail them? Brother Yu, it's just a temporary farewell, it's not like we won't meet again!"

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "Indeed! But this time, if I don't have enough strength, I may not return!"

"How long will it take?"

"As soon as possible!"

Xia Huyou laughed, "Understood! Within three years, you will return! Once the Upper Realm opens, if you haven't returned, then you are not Su Yu! Rest assured, in three years, if I'm not dead, this Human Realm will still bear the surname Su!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "These are trivial matters! Alright, if you wish to stay... I believe you can adapt, at worst, call Hundred Battle 'grandfather' a few times, I know you!"

"......"

Xia Huyou's face turned ugly, he glanced at Su Yu, I won't do that!

Bah!

Just slandering people!

Su Yu laughed again, then looked at the group, then at the group of Eternals, suddenly smiling, "So, all the Eternals are leaving, and most below Eternal are staying?"

At this moment, the Eternal experts seemed to be bidding farewell to some of the prefects.

Some were fathers to sons, some to grandsons, and these people seemed to choose to leave. This was interesting.

Over there, Qin Zhen was instructing his younger brother about something. Seeing Su Yu say this, he quickly flew over, sighing, "Eternals are high-end combat power, it's better to leave, lest they become eyesores! As for those below Eternal, like my brother, they won't attract much attention! I'm just worried, Qin Hao is too reckless, Emperor Yu, why not give him a military order to make him behave!"

In the distance, Qin Hao looked displeased, who are you talking about?

Are you any better?

Su Yu smiled, "Qin Hao wants to stay? Why not switch someone else, I'm also worried he'll cause trouble..."

Qin Zhen sighed, "I can't, my Qin family, I have to leave, my son Qin Fang, Emperor Yu knows, his talent is still good, I have to take him, otherwise, what if he's captured? Qin Hao's talent is average... let him stay, if he dies, it's no loss..."

These words... truly heartless!

In the distance, Qin Hao looked aggrieved, damn it, if he wasn't weaker than his big brother, he'd want to go up and beat him to death!

Everyone bullies him!

The second of the Zhu family bullies him, the second of the Xia family bullies him, the eldest of the Liu family bullies him, now even his own big brother bullies him!

Su Yu chuckled, not saying much.

Instead, he looked at Su Long not far away, suddenly smiling.

Su Long coughed, glanced around, not looking at Su Yu.

Su Yu looked at his father, smiled, "Who called my dad here?"

No one spoke.

Su Yu smiled again, "What, worried my dad wouldn't come, couldn't control me?"

"......"

Still no one spoke.

Seeing this, Zhu Tiandao also coughed, "No such thing, General Su came on his own..."

"He came on his own?"

Su Yu smiled, "He came on his own, and you didn't notice? Come on! No need for you to act for me, when I act, you may not act as well as I do!"

Although he wanted to say, when I act, you weren't even born.

But thinking about it, forget it, they're all old guys.

The youngest, Xia Huyou, was still older than him.

Zhu Tiandao didn't continue the topic, instead smiling, "Emperor Yu, are we going to the Abyssal Realm?"

Changing the topic!

Su Yu chuckled, looking at him for a while, "Old Zhu, you're sneaky, I think today's matter is inseparable from you!"

"......"

Zhu Tiandao was speechless, how do you talk?

Who's sneaky?

Have you forgotten how you used to call me grandpa?

Bah!

Su Yu was actually in a good mood, not as heavy as he appeared. Watching everyone enter the pages one by one, he didn't dwell on the earlier matter, while probing the surroundings, he said, "The human heart, use it sparingly!"

Chapter 1: The Gathering

Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.

Nanyuan City, Great Xia Prefecture.

Su Family.

Su Yu entered his home, the aroma of the dishes on the dining table immediately greeting him. Tossing his school bag aside, he approached the table and picked up a piece of red braised pork, popping it into his mouth.

While chewing, he glanced toward the indistinct figure in the kitchen. “Dad, how about making some soup tomorrow? Eating meat every day is getting a bit tiring.”

“Stop being picky. Be grateful you have something to eat,” came Su Long’s grumbling voice from the kitchen. “Also, you’re already eighteen. When are you going to learn to take care of yourself? I’ve been playing both father and mother for you all these years. I’m finally going to get my freedom.”

Still chewing, Su Yu smiled and praised, “Dad, your cooking skills are almost professional. I’d help in the kitchen, but unfortunately, everything I make is inedible!”

“Heh,” Su Long merely smirked. Su Yu was all talk and no action. After all, he had never even tried cooking. With a height of 1.9 meters and a sturdy physique, Su Long looked rather comical in a tiny apron that didn’t fit his powerful image. That had always been a point of contention for Su Yu, and today was no different.

Shaking his head, Su Yu complained, “Dad, can’t you get a bigger apron? It’s not like we can’t afford it.”

“What do you know?” Su Long couldn’t be bothered to answer. After placing the final dish on the table, he sat down without removing his apron. “Eat! We must save every bit of money we can. This apron is still new—”

“Dad, you’ve been saying that for the past three years.”

Su Yu rolled his eyes. Sure, it was understandable for his father to claim the apron was new three years ago. But it was rather shameless to still claim the same three years later. Su Long didn’t care about his son’s remarks and started gorging on the food.

Su Yu was used to his father’s antics. He sat down and began eating as well. While eating, he sighed and said, “Dad, is the battle picking up at the front line again? On my way back, I saw the military recruitment truck downstairs. They must be here recruiting in our neighborhood. I wonder who’s going to sign up—”

At that, Su Long stopped eating. He placed his bowl and chopsticks down before solemnly saying, “It is everyone’s duty to protect one’s home and defend one’s country. Just listen to yourself. Are you trying to say it’s bad to be a soldier?”

“Not at all!” Su Yu hurriedly explained. His father was a retired soldier. He definitely had to watch his mouth on this topic. After all, it wouldn’t be fun to be at the receiving end of his father’s palm, which was the size of a bear’s paw. Su Long snorted before returning to his meal.

Suddenly, Su Long spoke again, his tone shifting to a gloomy one. “Yu, the front line is in turmoil. The various armies have been recruiting repeatedly. New soldiers are constantly being recruited while veterans are being recalled.”

Su Yu paused mid-bite and looked up at his father. His attitude changed completely as he frowned and asked, “Dad, that has nothing to do with us, right? You’ve been retired for eighteen years, and I’ve just reached adulthood. Also, I’m applying for the high academies. The recruiters won’t come to us.”

“It has been eighteen years…” Su Long sighed. Yes, it had been eighteen years. “During the past eighteen years, the Devil Subduing Army has recalled retired veterans five times. After reaching fifty years old, I won’t be fit to be recalled any longer. During the previous four recalls, you were too young. I was worried about you, so I did not answer the recalls.”

Su Yu’s expression changed rapidly as he said, “Dad, our family can be exempted from joining the army! The policy allows this!”

“Yes, the policy allows this!” Su Long grinned. He raised his head and gazed at his son before saying, “Therefore, I’ve not been answering the recalls. In the past eighteen years, there have been four recalls apart from the current recall! I’ve not answered any of them! But now, my son has finally reached adulthood! He is now eighteen!”

“Dad!” Su Yu had an ugly expression. “What are you trying to say?”

“You know what I’m trying to say.” Su Long gazed at his son with a gratified and satisfied expression. He smiled and said, “Your dad might be useless, but eighteen years ago, he was a platoon leader in command of thirty soldiers. At the time, your mom was on the verge of giving birth, so I requested a leave of absence and returned. Who would have guessed that your mom would leave this world just like that. You were a newborn, and we didn’t have anyone else in the family to take care of you. I couldn’t leave, so I was forced to retire from the army.”

Su Long had a bitter smile on his face. “When I left, not a single one of my comrades saw me off. No, it wasn’t that they wanted me gone, but they were afraid that I wouldn’t be able to leave after seeing them. It has been eighteen years. Not one of them has tried contacting me. They’re all afraid that I wouldn’t be able to resist returning. Even in my dreams, I can see them shouting at me to return home and take care of my baby. Of my thirty brothers, nine were killed on the battlefield the first year after I left. Not one of the surviving members has left the army. Do you know what the remaining twenty-one of them are doing? They’re all still on the battlefield right now!”

Tears started welling in Su Long’s eyes. “I was selfish, so I didn’t dare to ask about them. I had not responded to the previous four recalls. But this time…Yu, if your dad has to die, he would rather die a soldier on the battlefield. Your dad does not wish to die behind the front line!”

Su Yu sank into silence. He was aware that his father had never forgotten the front line and the old comrades there. If his mother had not passed away during childbirth back then, his father would never have retired from the Devil Subduing Army. He had always thought that eighteen years would be enough for his father to forget and let go of the past. Today, he learned that his father had not forgotten about the past after all.

“Dad…” Su Yu paled as he persuaded, “The front line is in turmoil. The number of casualties among our soldiers is only getting higher and higher. In the past eighteen years alone, the army had recalled retired veterans five times. In short, a recall was made once every three to four years. You used to be a soldier. You know very well what that means. I’m still single. I still haven’t entered a high academy. I still haven’t gotten you a grandchild…”

Su Long grinned, “It’s fine. I’ll be waiting for all that! What? You think I’m going to be throwing my life away on the battlefield? No! I’m there to win the war!”

“Dad!”

“Cut the crap, kid! Eat your meal!” Su Long cut his son off. While eating, he mumbled, “After this meal, you’ll have to start preparing your own meals. If you can’t cook, go eat outside. Use the money in my card. You know the password. They’re still waiting for me downstairs. I need to make this quick. Remember to mail me a letter after passing your academy entrance exam. I’ll be reading your letters during my free time. You’ll be getting into a cultural research academy. Your old man is very proud of you, you know that? You’re practically guaranteed a spot in a cultural research academy already. Your teacher told me that barring anything unexpected happening, you’ll definitely be able to join one. A talent is finally going to emerge from our Su family! I do wonder sometimes. How exactly have you grown that brain of yours? You’re way too smart. I used to wonder if you’re actually my son. Fortunately, you greatly resemble my younger self in appearance.”

Su Yu had a pale complexion at the realization that his father was about to step into the battlefield. Nevertheless, he still couldn’t stop himself from challenging that claim, “Dad, are you sure I look like your younger self?”

“What bullshit question is that? That’s the truth!” Su Long looked up, revealing his rough face and grinned, “Feel free to ask our neighbor if you doubt me!”

Su Yu was speechless. He knew that his father was trying to shift the topic, so he returned to the previous topic, “Dad, must you go? It’s not that I’m looking down on you, but it has been eighteen years since you left the battlefield. You haven’t been cultivating much either. Even now, you’re still at the ninth-stage Great Strength Realm. Will you even be helpful on the battlefield?”

“Who are you looking down on?” Su Long said furiously, “So what if I’m only at the ninth-stage Great Strength Realm? Strength is not the only thing that matters on the battlefield. Otherwise, wars would be pointless. Everything is possible on the battlefield. I’ll have you know that I once killed an Infinite Strength Realm expert when I was only a seventh-stage Great Strength cultivator.”

Su Yu was still very distressed. He had no idea if that story was true, but his father had repeated the story for many years. It was highly probable that his father was telling the truth. However, he did not want his father to go to war. The front line was very chaotic. Every single year, a large number of soldiers would die there. The situation there was only getting more and more dangerous. His father was nearly fifty years old. Su Yu didn’t even dare to imagine what it would be like for someone like that to return to the battlefield.

“Dad—”

“Shut up!” Su Long interrupted his son. He stood up and put the dishes away before saying with a solemn expression, “I’ve signed myself up. If I don’t show up, I’ll be considered a deserter. It’s fine if I don’t show up before signing up, but you know the consequences for not showing up now. A deserter will be executed!”

“Dad, couldn’t you have waited for me to come back and talk about this before signing up?”

Just thinking about it made Su Yu furious. He knew that there was nothing he could do to change this. His father was right. It didn’t matter before signing up. The recall order was not compulsory. All these veterans who had retired alive were people who had contributed to the army during their time on the battlefield. But upon signing up, one would be considered a soldier yet again. Not showing up after that would cause one to be labeled a deserter.

“What is there to talk about?” Su Long said dismissively, “Don’t worry. I won’t die. Even if I do end up dying, you will be eligible for a nice compensation. Don’t forget to claim it if I end up dying. That will be enough money for you to get a wife and raise a child. See, your old man has everything planned for you!”

Then, Su Long removed the apron from his body and picked up the backpack that he had packed earlier, behaving as casually as someone leaving for a short trip. “Do well in your exam. People like you who are supporting humanity behind the front line are just as important. Perform well in the cultural research academy and bring glory to our Su family. Cultural research academy…yes, I’ll need to tell everyone about that after returning to the army. I have a son that has managed to enter a cultural research academy. That’s far more incredible than their children. It’s a pity that I won’t be here to see your acceptance letter. Remember to snap a picture of the letter and mail it to me. I need proof or those fellows will think that I’m merely bragging.”

“Dad!” Su Yu stood up and ran after his departing father in panic. His father was really going to leave. He had been used to living with his father for the past eighteen years. He was not mentally prepared for this sudden departure.

“You’re all grown up now. Don’t cry like a little boy.” Su Long grinned. “If you’re still a child, I won’t leave. But now that you’re an adult, I must go. When I left eighteen years ago, there were several kids as old as you currently are in the platoon. Yu, do you know? I dreamed of them. They were crying in pain in the dream, telling me to kill all those animals. I regret my decision to not send you to the Military House of Dependents back then. After all, there would still be someone looking after you while I’m in the army if I did.”

Su Long teared up. “This is the fifth recall. During the previous four recalls, I had my luggage packed up every single time. But every time I laid my eyes on you, I selfishly stayed behind. I couldn’t bring myself to leave. This is the fifth time! Will there be a next time for me? I’ll probably be over fifty by then and the Devil Subduing Army will no longer accept me! It is time for me to go. The Allheaven Battlefield is waiting for me. Just you watch. I’ll kill a few Infinite Strength Realm experts this time and keep the evidence. You won’t be able to doubt me anymore after that.”

Then, Su Long waved his hand and walked away. This was the very first time Su Yu had seen his father this carefree and heroic in his eighteen years of life. However, this wasn’t something he wanted to see.

“Dad…”

“I told you to cut the crap.”

Standing before the door, Su Yu clenched his teeth and shouted, “If you fail to return, I’ll become a live-in son-in-law! I’ll change my surname and sever the inheritance of your Su family! If you really don’t care, trust that I’ll really dare to do so as well!”

“I—” Su Long staggered and nearly turned around to unleash profanities at his son. He suddenly had the urge to stay behind and beat up his son. He knew that his son would really be capable of doing something like that. It hadn’t been easy for the Su family to finally give birth to a talented individual like Su Yu. He definitely wouldn’t be able to accept such a talent marrying into someone else’s family.

On one side, a head suddenly popped out from the Abyssal Race's realm passage. It was the Fate Emperor. He glanced around, and everyone turned to look at him. The Fate Emperor cleared his throat, "Don't just drag me into things for no reason! Remember, everyone, I'm a good guy!"

"......"

A group of people were left speechless.

This guy had been here all along?

This... was truly a united front!

Su Yu chuckled, looking around, and said, "So it seems everyone is here now, right? No one missing?"

It seemed like everyone had arrived!

Everyone looked around and laughed, realizing it was true.

Over there, Tian Yue and Chongming were together, and in the distance, the Spirit Suppression lineage had also arrived. Even further away, towering ancient cities stood tall.

"Everyone's here!"

The Fate Emperor also smiled. Indeed, no one in the lower realms was blind.

Everyone had their eyes wide open, knowing how to choose.

Just as they were speaking, someone suddenly said, "Hey, isn't someone missing?"

"Hmm?"

"Where's Duobao?"

"Did that coward run away?"

"He probably did. That guy is as timid as a mouse... No, he is a mouse, so it's normal for him to run. It's actually good if he ran!"

"......"

June and the others were chatting, and it seemed like only Duobao had run away.

If he ran, he ran.

No one had paid much attention to him earlier.

Su Yu also laughed. Ran away?

Then so be it!

Duobao was indeed very timid. If he ran, it was normal, and not worth worrying about.

Just as he was about to lead everyone into the realm, suddenly, in the distance, the void rippled, and a figure traversed through.

In the next moment, Duobao appeared before everyone.

Seeing everyone staring at him, Duobao looked dazed. Why are you all looking at me?

He didn't care and quickly put on a smile, saying, "Your Majesty Emperor Yu, I went to find the Heavenly Overseer Marquis a few days ago! I got some important information, and I rushed over here. Why is everyone gathered here?"

As he spoke, he said happily, "It's like this, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis said that recently, the human race's fortune hasn't fallen but has risen! So he deduced that the Great Zhou King and the others might still be alive. Your Majesty, this is great news, it means we still have hope of rescuing them! Although the Heavenly Overseer Marquis is our enemy, his fortune observation is top-notch! Despite this major defeat, our fortune hasn't fallen but risen, which means things are turning around..."

Su Yu looked at him strangely and smiled, "You went to see the Heavenly Overseer Marquis?"

"Yes, I was worried everyone would be depressed. I have a decent relationship with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, so I asked him, and the human race's fortune hasn't fallen..."

Su Yu laughed, "So, you checked the fortune and then came back? Were you planning to run before?"

"No!"

Duobao righteously declared, "I never intended to leave. I want to live and die with the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

"......"

Yeah, right!

He was indeed as timid as a mouse, probably just went to ask the Heavenly Overseer Marquis if he should run.

Su Yu laughed, "Did he say anything else?"

"He did..."

Duobao quickly said, "He said his strength has increased again! Also, he mentioned that back when Hundred Battle had an incident, the fortune fell, which might indicate some issues. It wasn't just because Hundred Battle was sealed, but because Hundred Battle directly stripped away a portion of the fortune power..."

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "Not surprising."

Hundred Battle likely stripped it away, separating from the human race's fortune, which caused the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's fortune power to fall back then, leading to repeated misfortunes after the Ninth Tide.

"Anything else?"

"Yes!"

Duobao immediately nodded, "The Heavenly Overseer Marquis also said that if Emperor Yu is strong, he is strong, but the stronger he gets, the stronger Emperor Yu becomes, which might not be a good thing... It means Emperor Yu is somewhat entangled with him now..."

Su Yu laughed, "This guy, his senses are quite sharp!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis represents the ancient era, and now Su Yu, in a way, has inherited some of the ancient remnants.

Hundred Battle, on the other hand, has detached from it.

This talk of factions... sometimes it changes just like that!

Of course, the entanglement isn't too deep. Su Yu chuckled, "Alright, I know! It's not time to kill him yet! I won't kill him now, and Hundred Battle probably won't either... just wait!"

Hundred Battle won't kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, even if he knows what the Heavenly Overseer Marquis represents.

However, killing the Heavenly Overseer Marquis wouldn't benefit Hundred Battle, only harm him.

The Upper Realm might end up with over a dozen more rulers of laws!

Maybe even more!

How many Heavenly Sovereigns does Hundred Battle have under his command?

He walks the path of the physical body, whether the seal breaks or not, it's all the same. Hundred Battle probably still needs to protect the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

The enemy and ally relationship is often this complex.

At this moment, whoever is weaker will protect the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

If the myriad races knew, they would probably rush to the lower realms and kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis to end it!

As for Duobao...

Su Yu didn't say much more. This guy, his fortune is actually quite good.

At critical moments, he often manages to escape disaster.

"Enter the realm!"

Su Yu said no more, leading everyone into the realm.

...

Abyssal Realm.

Still a scene of devastation.

However, today Su Yu planned to transform this realm!

He would sink this realm into the Death Realm, and after sinking, dig tunnels and open myriad paths.

"Consort Qi!"

Su Yu called out softly, and Consort Qi, who had just returned, quickly flew over.

Su Yu walked through the air, looking at the entire Abyssal Realm, and said in a deep voice, "I want to sink this realm into the Death Realm. Consort Qi, you will need to petrify this realm, which won't be easy!"

Consort Qi nodded slightly.

Su Yu called out again, "General Hongmeng!"

Hongmeng quickly arrived.

"Open the thirty-six city passages, connect life and death, and assist me!"

"Understood!"

Hongmeng shouted, and the next moment, he roared, "Thirty-six sacred cities, open the passages!"

Rumble!

Thirty-six massive ancient cities instantly opened the death passages, and streams of death energy permeated the heavens and earth. The entire Abyssal Realm was instantly filled with death energy!

Outside, there seemed to be a power of laws sweeping in.

Su Yu didn't pay much attention.

At this moment, he silently sensed, and after a moment, the Heaven Gate opened, revealing a great path in his eyes. It was the Abyssal Path. Su Yu's eyes lit up, and he shouted, "Fate Emperor, help me sever the Abyssal Path!"

Sever the connection between this path and the Realm of Living Beings!

Su Yu pointed, and a light shadow appeared in the void. The Fate Emperor said no more, and a force of the great path erupted instantly, intertwining the Path of Fate with the Abyssal Path in the blink of an eye.

"Fat Ball, assist, bite off the connection between the Abyssal Path and this realm!"

"Woof!"

Fat Ball's great path shadow appeared, biting towards the manifested Abyssal Path. At this moment, the Abyssal Path trembled violently, as if unwilling to sever the connection!

And Su Yu shouted, "South King, Marquis Lanshan, cover with the power of the Death Path!"

The next moment, from the ancient cities, several powerful death spirits emerged, all taking action!

Using death energy to sever the connection between the Abyssal Path and the River of Time!

Su Yu continued to command. Sinking a realm into the abyss was somewhat challenging, but for him, it wasn't too difficult.

With the actions of the powerful individuals, the entire Abyssal Path showed signs of breaking. At this moment, the entire Abyssal Realm trembled violently.

Rumble!

Loud noises echoed through the heavens and earth.

...

At this moment, in the realms of gods, demons, and immortals, a trace of power seeped out.

Soon, it seemed all realms knew something.

In the Immortal Realm.

Tiangu wore a heavy expression and said softly, "What a Su Yu!"

Beside him, the Symbol King frowned, "My lord, what are they doing in the Abyssal Realm?"

"Doing something big!"

Tiangu sighed, "Su Yu... is probably going to withdraw from the Myriad Realms! He is sinking the entire Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm!"

Such boldness!

Sinking an entire realm!

From now on, the Myriad Realms will have no Abyssal Realm.

Yet the Symbol King still didn't understand, "Does this mean Su Yu has truly been defeated and is fleeing? My lord, do you think if we join forces with the gods and demons now, we can stop him from escaping..."

Tiangu glanced at him, idiot!

"Go into seclusion and cultivate!"

Tiangu couldn't be bothered to say more.

Stop him?

Why stop him!

Are you looking for death?

Su Yu says he's defeated, and you believe him?

He's probably killed countless in the Upper Realm. If he was truly defeated, would he dare to make such a big move? He wouldn't fear you!

If the three great races dare to act now... they are all waiting to die!

Su Yu is about to run, does he care if the Upper Realm opens?

Be careful, this guy might do something ruthless and wipe out even the three great races!

...

Rumble!

The intense noise shook the entire lower realm.

The massive Abyssal Realm continued to sink!

...

Within the Abyssal Realm.

The Abyssal Path struggled violently, as if unwilling to sever its connection with this realm. Su Yu grew impatient and shouted, "Fat Ball, stomp it!"

Boom!

A massive boot stomped down!

The Abyssal Path, as if alive, quickly dodged, feeling somewhat horrified.

Su Yu laughed, "Abyssal Path... this means its master might still be alive!"

The Abyssal Emperor of the past likely wasn't dead yet!

However, this was just a projection connection of the path, how could it dodge the boot of the Culture King? After several stomps, with a loud boom, the path was stomped into a state of collapse.

Here, Fat Ball was actually affected and suppressed, yet this boot was unaffected!

As the path's shadow began to collapse, the suppressive force against foreign races in the realm showed signs of dissipating. This was the rule!

Now, even the rule itself was beginning to collapse, so naturally, the suppressive force would also collapse.

Boom!

The noise resounded again, and at this moment, the entire Abyssal Realm was filled with death energy, gradually starting to sink. Within the thirty-six passages, a large amount of death energy poured in!

Rumble, the loud noise came one after another, the violent tremors causing the mountains and rivers within the realm to collapse!

Death energy seeped in from all directions.

Su Yu, however, didn't mind. It might not be a bad thing.

The master of the Death Path had extracted all the death energy from the Myriad Realms, making the paths of the Myriad Realms not quite complete, lacking the path of death!

Now, with some death energy seeping in, it's a good thing. Later, when the River of Time is opened, it can be dispersed and neutralized, and the paths here might even be restored to their state before the master of the Death Path opened the heavens!

More complete.

Of course, at this moment, Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened, and he suddenly saw an enormous death path, vaguely crashing against the barrier, trying to assimilate this realm!

Su Yu shouted, "Liu Hong, stop it! Devour the power of the Death Path!"

Outside the realm, Liu Hong, who had been released by Lantian, gritted his teeth and let out a furious roar. A wave of death energy surged forth as a great path manifested, swiftly drawing upon the power of the Death Path, forcing it to invade the Ink Path.

Boom!

The entire realm began to sink!

"Consort Qi, seal the area outside the 36th passageway. Don't let the death energy seep through completely!"

Consort Qi quickly flew out, beginning to petrify the weak points throughout the realm!

As Consort Qi's petrification spread, a massive influx of death energy poured into the 36th passageway. In the void, the Abyssal Path suddenly and completely collapsed, its shadow shattered, and all suppressive forces within the realm dissipated!

Boom!

At that moment, a sound that shook the Myriad Realms echoed out!

Many powerful beings turned their gaze towards the Abyssal Realm.

In the nearby Divine Realm, several powerful beings extended their willpower to investigate, only to quickly retreat. The intense death energy surged skyward, corroding their willpower with a sizzling sound!

...

Within the Abyssal Realm.

Su Yu and his companions clearly felt the realm descending!

With the descent, darkness enveloped them!

In the next moment, it felt as if they had sunk into the earth. With a thunderous crash, the ground trembled, seemingly making contact with the Death Realm, fully integrating the entire realm into the Death Realm.

A powerful shockwave reverberated through both the Death Realm and the Abyssal Realm.

At the connection point of the Death Realm and the Luminous Domain Mansion, a figure suddenly appeared.

The Martial Emperor emerged, looking towards the not-so-distant massive circular realm, which resembled a star, as it plunged into the Death Realm, sinking into the Spirit Suppression Domain!

"Damn it!"

The Martial Emperor suddenly cursed. What was this lunatic doing, dropping the Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm for no reason?

He wasn't the only one who sensed it. At that moment, in the Land of the Abyss, the North King suddenly floated into the air, looking into the distance, also witnessing the massive realm's descent!

His expression changed instantly!

Was this an entire realm falling?

Did Su Yu do this?

What was he trying to achieve?

"A turbulent time!"

The North King sighed inwardly. The Death Realm might become even more unstable. Even though it was already unstable before, now that Su Yu had sunk an entire realm into it, things were bound to get more complicated!

Beside him, the Dragonblood Marquis, exuding a powerful aura and a hint of anticipation, suddenly said, "So, does this mean we can take over this realm and directly connect the realms of life and death?"

What a grand move!

The Dragonblood Marquis marveled, growing more excited. This was a good thing!

If they could seize it... would the realms of life and death be directly connected from now on?

...

At the same time.

Deep within the Land of the Abyss, beams of light fluctuated, and faces appeared, looking into the distance, all witnessing the massive realm's descent into the Death Realm.

They were all surprised and shaken.

Was the descent of a living realm a good thing or a bad thing?

...

Su Yu, unconcerned with what others thought, was extremely excited as the massive shockwave hit. It worked!

"Seal the 36th passageway!"

With a loud shout, all the passageways were sealed, and countless waves of death energy spread!

At this moment, the entire realm resembled a semi-Death Realm.

And Su Yu, at this moment, needed to dig a hole!

Taking advantage of the recent descent, before the Death Path could fully erode, he needed to dig a hole in the River of Time!

Otherwise, it would be difficult to do so later.

"Lantian!"

With a loud shout, the weakened Lantian emerged, followed by the appearance of numerous powerful light clusters.

With a wave of Su Yu's hand, all the Eternal and Daofuse Realm experts appeared.

As for those below, Su Yu did not release them.

It was too dangerous!

Here, the death energy was still abundant, and besides, for those below the Eternal Realm, comprehending the Great Path wouldn't be too beneficial.

Su Yu said solemnly, "I'm going to dig a hole. Once it's pierced, a large amount of the power of laws will surge in... Everyone, you'll have to rely on yourselves to gradually sort out the Great Path. Whether this place becomes suitable for us to live in depends on how well you manage it!"

"Rest assured, Emperor Yu!"

Everyone shouted in unison!

They were all somewhat excited; it was time to dig a hole!

And Su Yu quickly exited the Abyssal Realm. At this moment, the passageway to the living realm hadn't disappeared or been blocked. As long as he found the Abyssal Path, Su Yu could dig along that direction without error!

After all, before this, the Abyssal Path was connected here.

Su Yu swiftly tore through the River of Time and entered it.

He, too, needed to learn from his predecessors and start digging holes in the River of Time. Who knew if the owner of this path was still alive?

If they were, and one day saw their Great Path being dug up like this, they'd probably be furious enough to want to kill someone!

"Anyway, I'm not the first to dig..."

With this thought, Su Yu instantly felt no guilt. He wasn't the first; he would just dig a hole the size of a bowl, yes, just that big!
