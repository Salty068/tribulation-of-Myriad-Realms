Chapter 714: The Conditions of Marquis Giant Bamboo

In the grand hall, April and May were both solemn.

The folks from the lower realm had ascended.

The current Beast Emperor of the Iron Devourer Race had personally come to the upper realm to persuade them, and had already participated in the battles of the lower realm. The news hadn't spread yet, but once it did, it was likely that powerful figures from the myriad races would come knocking.

Even September had participated in the war against the Dragon Race.

At this moment, several Iron Devourer Beasts were deep in thought, contemplating the future and their next steps. A single misstep could lead to the extinction of their race.

At this time, the large bamboo in Su Yu's hand trembled slightly, and a faint willpower seeped out.

"Got him!"

General Wen Qi had been captured.

The commotion was minimal, and even Su Yu hadn't sensed it. After all, how could a newly advanced fifth or sixth-stage Daofuse Realm escape the grasp of Blue Sky and the others?

April sensed the fluctuation and looked at Su Yu again, her eyes gleaming as she spoke, "Young friend, you seem quite young. Are you a new generation powerhouse of our race?"

Su Yu smiled, "Senior April, how long until Marquis Giant Bamboo returns?"

He didn't respond directly.

April, with a hint of seriousness, looked at Su Yu again, "The Source of the Dao is still far from here. Upon receiving the message, if Marquis Giant Bamboo has no other matters, he can return within a day."

A Heavenly King-level powerhouse would still need about a day, indicating the considerable distance.

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling, "Then let's discuss this further when Marquis Giant Bamboo returns."

April seemed to understand something and didn't press further. Instead, she pondered for a moment and said, "Wen Qi has been captured?"

"Yes."

"He is, after all, a general under Marquis Zhennan. The Iron Devourer Race and the Human Race have been allies since ancient times. If Marquis Zhennan finds out... he might be somewhat displeased."

Su Yu chuckled, "An individual does not represent the Human Race! The Human Race is a race, not a single person! In today's era, unless the Human Emperor returns, the only one who can represent the Human Race is not Marquis Zhennan!"

Su Yu continued with a smile, "In this world, it's still the biggest fist that speaks! Marquis Zhennan's fist isn't big enough, so he doesn't get to decide!"

Marquis Zhennan doesn't get to decide!

April had a rough idea of who Su Yu might be, or rather, that he was someone under Emperor Yu, or perhaps Emperor Yu himself.

To speak of Marquis Zhennan so casually, even if he wasn't Emperor Yu himself, he was certainly a trusted general under him.

April remained silent for a while before speaking in a heavy tone, "Our race has actually been secretly assisting the Human Race, but assistance is limited! We can't offer unlimited help, including this time with Wen Qi's arrival. We may not take his words seriously!"

"Rescuing Hundred Battle King is not that simple! The Source of the Dao is incredibly complex, with countless powerhouses. Even if our Iron Devourer Race goes all out, we might face extinction, and the hope of rescuing Hundred Battle King is slim!"

"Alliances, assistance, and cooperation all come with conditions."

April said gravely, "The reason our race continues to help the Human Race is not solely because of some ancient alliance. There are many reasons. First, Marquis Giant Bamboo has ties with the Human Race. Second, our race believes that some powerhouses will return, including the Culture King and others. Third, the God, Demon, and Immortal races also want to dominate the heavens, and we are unwilling, as we have grudges."

This April, the Iron Devourer Emperor after ancient times, was more stable than September and the others.

At this moment, she continued slowly, "Helping the Human Race, we can assist in secret, but full support—what can that bring to our race? Destruction, or something else? Wen Qi's words are filled with uncertainty. If Hundred Battle King isn't unsealed, does that mean our race will have to bear immense pressure? Perhaps even face extinction?"

Su Yu nodded, "Wen Qi is just a fraud, trying to deceive people without much real skill! He's gambling with no cards to play, just a desperate gamble."

What could Wen Qi offer?

A few Daofuse Realm experts?

Aside from that, it seemed like there was nothing else.

Such a person, if not for deceit, what else could he do?

If he succeeded in deceiving, that would be the best, at least there would be some hope. If he failed, the Iron Devourer Race probably wouldn't do much to him. Overall, they wouldn't lose anything. If they truly succeeded in unsealing Hundred Battle King, it would be a huge gain!

A guaranteed win, even if it was a deception.

"What can the Human Race of the lower realm offer the Iron Devourer Race?"

April asked again.

You say Wen Qi is a fraud, but what about you?

What can you offer us?

Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled, "It seems like not much. Even if we become stronger, it's us who become stronger, not the Iron Devourer Race! I can only say that the Iron Devourer Race might have a greater chance to resist the impending fate of extinction."

"Extinction?"

April looked at him without speaking.

Su Yu nodded, "Once the upper realm opens and the Human Race is defeated, the myriad races won't target the Iron Devourer Race right away. Senior April wouldn't think it's because the Iron Devourer Race is extremely powerful, right? It's just that the myriad races don't want to target the Iron Devourer Race now to avoid depleting their strength! Once the Human Race is exterminated, the Iron Devourer Race will undoubtedly be the next strong race to be targeted... a hundred percent!"

Beside him, May grumbled, "That's also caused by the Human Race!"

A bit displeased!

Su Yu wasn't wrong, but the cause still originated from the Human Race.

May grumbled, displeased, "So, because we helped the Human Race, when the Human Race is exterminated, we suffer! And you're using this as a benefit to persuade us? How are you any different from Wen Qi?"

Su Yu spread his hands, "I just didn't paint a grand picture, making empty promises. A year ago, I could have offered better than Wen Qi, promising you ten or eight rulers of laws..."

Su Yu said, smiling confidently, "Now, there's no need!"

Yes, there's no need now.

I don't need to paint a grand picture for you!

This is confidence, and also a foundation.

The Iron Devourer Race is strong, but even if they are fewer, it doesn't necessarily mean they can't do it.

Beside him, September chimed in, "That's right, Big Bamboo is right! What we need now isn't an empty future, but some real existing issues!"

September said earnestly, "The Iron Devourer Race in the lower realm has already become an ally of the Human Race. Whether the ancestors feel deceived or unfortunate, at that time, without joining, perhaps there wouldn't be an Iron Devourer Race in the lower realm now!"

"In the lower realm, we also did it for the continuation of our race!"

"This time in the upper realm, it's the same!"

"We've already chosen our side. At this time, if the ancestors want to distance themselves from the lower realm, it's actually very difficult."

September said seriously, "Before I came, Ancestor June said that the Iron Devourer Race in the upper realm actually has no choice... unless they capture Emperor Yu and offer him to the myriad races, then, in a grand act of righteousness, capture Ancestor June and me, and offer us to the myriad races, compromising for survival. Only then might the myriad races give up on exterminating our race!"

Today's September was quite eloquent.

In reality, September and the other powerhouses like June weren't fools.

Although Su Yu's side wasn't as powerful as the upper realm, the upper realm... wasn't dominated by just one faction. The three races couldn't rule the entire upper realm.

One-on-one, the lower realm wasn't afraid of any race.

April remained silent for a while, and after a long time, she said, "I understand. I will convey these words to Marquis Giant Bamboo. You two... rest here for a while. May, Full Moon, come with me. We need to go out and discuss."

"Take care, ancestors!"

September grinned foolishly, watching the Iron Devourer Beasts leave.

Once they were gone, he suddenly laughed, "Master, I did well today, didn't I?"

Su Yu smiled, "Not bad! I didn't expect you to be so articulate."

September grinned foolishly, and after a moment, he said quickly, "Actually, the ancestors have no choice. As for what I said about capturing Emperor Yu and offering him to the myriad races, it's a dead end. If they really captured Emperor Yu, Lord Blue and the others wouldn't let it go."

Su Yu smiled but said nothing.

That was indeed a path.

Let's see how the Iron Devourer Race chooses.

At this moment, Su Yu was also waiting for Marquis Giant Bamboo to return, while pondering other matters.

Previously, he hadn't planned to deal with the few Human Race members.

But now, Su Yu was thinking, if I don't deal with them... I'm afraid they'll cause trouble.

Not necessarily intentional trouble, but they might think an opportunity has arisen.

"If Chaos Mountain and the myriad races engage in a great war, if a war breaks out, at this moment, Marquis Huoyun and the others might really think the opportunity has come, and delve into the Source of the Dao to rescue Hundred Battle King."

The possibility wasn't small.

Of course, the myriad races might also consider this and even set a trap to capture them all at once, saving the trouble and luring them out of danger.

Perhaps, this was a setup.

Once the few Human Race marquises emerged and went to the Source of the Dao, they might be wiped out in one go.

Didn't Marquis Zhennan and the others know?

They knew!

But now they were desperate, and Hundred Battle King had become the only hope. Since that was the case, taking a gamble was normal, and they might even pull in some allies to gamble for a chance.

"In desperate times, pulling in allies to gamble for life isn't unusual. It's a normal choice. The only problem is... this is gambling with life!"

Su Yu shook his head.

Wen Qi's deception, in Su Yu's view, wasn't a problem, but since it was a gamble with life, how could they hide the matter of Marquis Dingjun?

Inform the Iron Devourer Race, analyze the pros and cons, even if unfamiliar, they could find a way to contact them.

Turn Su Yu into their strength, becoming an ally.

Simply coming to deceive, that was what Su Yu found displeasing.

Ruining the reputation of the Human Race!

Even if you directly told the Iron Devourer Race, now is the chance, let's gamble for a chance, the danger level is extremely high, you might die, but if you win, Hundred Battle King will be freed, Su Yu could understand that.

The Iron Devourer Race should also understand, whether to go or not, it's up to the Iron Devourer Race.

Direct deception meant they intended to make the Iron Devourer Race a target, even using their sacrifice to free Hundred Battle King.

"Human Race..."

Su Yu sighed in his heart. These ancient Human Race members, some of their ideas were deeply ingrained.

Foreign races are foreign races, and the Human Race is the Human Race.

No matter how much Hundred Battle King deceives, he's still one of us.

No matter how much the Iron Devourer Race helps, they're still outsiders.

Using the sacrifice of the Iron Devourer Race to unseal Hundred Battle King, that's worth it.

"It's no wonder these guys are so staunchly supportive of the Hundred Battle King. In their eyes, his only flaw was that final defeat. The sacrifices of countless allied races before that? Not really a mistake!"

Su Yu finally understood the mindset of these people. The Hundred Battle King wasn't wrong for leading allies to their doom; his mistake was losing the last battle.

"This is different from the ideology of the ancient Human Race. The ancient humans were domineering, but they had a way of winning hearts. They managed to maintain alliances for tens of thousands of years, with allies still willing to fight for them even during the Ninth Tide."

"The smart ones have either disappeared or died, leaving behind a bunch of stubborn fools and idiots in power. It's no wonder they were destroyed!"

Su Yu didn't think it was the fault of the ancient Human Race. If the ancient Human Emperor had been like the Hundred Battle King, would the Iron Devourer Race have waited ten thousand years for the humans? Don't be ridiculous!

The ancient humans were domineering and ruthless to their enemies, but they treated their allies well. Otherwise, why would their allies support them for ten thousand years even after the Human Emperor was gone?

"The wise ones like the Culture King are gone, leaving behind either brutes or die-hard racists. How could such a Human Race not be defeated?"

Even if the Hundred Battle King had won against the myriad races last time, the resistance would have continued unless he exterminated all the powerful beings of the myriad races. With his mindset of humans being supreme and the myriad races as slaves, war was inevitable.

Co-ruling the Myriad Realms? What a joke.

At this moment, Su Yu was pondering these thoughts.

...

Meanwhile, in another location.

April and a few others were observing from a high mountain.

After a long observation, April took a deep breath and said, "There are powerful beings on the periphery. I don't know exactly how many! It might be those who destroyed the Dragon Race; maybe they're all here. Wen Qi disappeared without a trace... These people are strong!"

May felt uneasy and awkwardly said, "Are they threatening us?"

"Not necessarily."

April glanced at the distant hall and said, "It shouldn't be a threat. The one down there with September might not be from our Iron Devourer Race. His status seems important. If it were a threat, he probably wouldn't come personally."

"Not from our race?"

May asked in confusion, "I really sensed the aura of the Seventy-Two Castings."

"Yes."

April also sensed it. "He must have learned our Seventy-Two Castings. It's normal. With great talent, even outsiders can learn it."

Nearby, Full Moon curiously asked, "That September claimed to have walked the Devouring Dao. Fourth Ancestor, can our race still cultivate the Devouring Dao?"

"He said it was passed down from February... I didn't ask in detail. Maybe Marquis Giant Bamboo knows. We'll talk when he returns."

April gave a reminder and quickly added, "These people are ruthless! If what September said is true, then the lower realm has probably changed drastically! As for their exact strength, we can ask Marquis Giant Bamboo when he returns. Considering our race, we need to see if there's any hope of resisting the gods, demons, and immortals... If not, it's worth discussing further!"

"Father, are you saying we should still support the alliance?"

May was displeased and said, "The Human Race is treacherous. I've long since stopped wanting to ally with them!"

April laughed, "It depends on which humans and who they're treacherous to. If Wen Qi and those guys are scheming against us, it's naturally uncomfortable! But if they're cunning against the enemy, that's a good thing. Do you really want to team up with fools to fight the gods and demons?"

May thought for a moment, nodded his big head, but still sighed, "The ancient Human Race wasn't like this! The later bastards only tricked us... I'm very disappointed!"

Thinking back, the ancient Human Race was indeed formidable. The Iron Devourer Race once followed them in conquering the Myriad Realms, winning battles and sharing spoils. Even in defeat, the losses were shared equally between humans and allies.

At least it was fair.

After the ancient era's fall, allies were tricked time and again. By the Ninth Tide, they were completely deceived.

April said nothing.

May's words weren't entirely wrong. If things remained like the Hundred Battle King's era, he wouldn't want to ally with the Human Race. Even if it meant danger, even knowing that the fall of the Human Race would spell doom for the Iron Devourer Race, he wouldn't want to be the Hundred Battle King's vanguard.

It all depended on what kind of different outcome Emperor Yu, whom September praised to the skies, could bring them.

...

A day passed without incident.

The next day, a powerful aura spread from afar!

In the distance.

A colossal Iron Devourer Beast, carrying an enormous bamboo, flew swiftly towards Bamboo Mountain.

Even the space was shattered by its passage!

Around Bamboo Mountain, some clan dojos were present, and among them, some Daofuse Realm masters were extremely solemn. Marquis Giant Bamboo had returned!

Wasn't he supposed to be in the Land of Dao Source?

Could he have sensed a threat and returned to guard Bamboo Mountain?

In the distance, a demon expert spread his willpower and shouted, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, why have you returned? Since you're back, it's perfect timing. Will you attend the Myriad Race Council?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo looked over, speaking in a simple manner, "What Myriad Race Council?"

"..."

The question was hard to answer. What do you mean by 'what Myriad Race Council'? Don't you know?

Despite the awkwardness, the demon Daofuse quickly replied, "The Dragon Race incident requires the Myriad Races to discuss how to deal with those rebels."

"Oh!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo nodded, "We'll see."

"Marquis Giant Bamboo, even if the Iron Devourer Race doesn't participate, it's best not to cause trouble. Getting involved with the Human Race brings no benefit to the Iron Devourer Race..."

The other party warned.

The Myriad Races were actually worried that strong races like the Iron Devourer Race might help those people.

The Iron Devourer Race didn't have many Daofuse experts, but their strength was undeniable.

Marquis Giant Bamboo was a quasi-king realm expert.

March... might still be alive, hiding in the Land of Dao Source.

"Oh!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo nodded, "Alright, got it!"

"And..."

Marquis Giant Bamboo said simply, "I'm going home now. Don't call me again. If you do... I'll eat you, okay? Be good, alright?"

"..."

In the distance, the demon Daofuse said no more and quickly left.

Marquis Giant Bamboo was easy to talk to.

But if he said that and you didn't leave, he might really hit you with a bamboo and eat you.

Marquis Giant Bamboo chuckled, watching the other leave, and left with a simple smile. So much nonsense. If it weren't for business, I'd have hit you with a bamboo already!

He continued flying.

After a while, Marquis Giant Bamboo's eyes moved, looking towards a small mountain on the outskirts of Bamboo Mountain. He glanced, with some doubt and seriousness, but quickly returned to normal and flew towards Bamboo Mountain.

Bamboo Mountain was still safe.

At this moment, Marquis Giant Bamboo was still pondering whether the presence in the outer valley was the lower realm expert mentioned by April.

So powerful!

Almost fooled me, but this place is Bamboo Mountain, after all. I've been here for too long.

"When did the lower realm produce so many experts? Unfamiliar aura, newly emerged?"

Thinking about it, three Daofuse experts flew over.

"Marquis Giant Bamboo!"

April and the others greeted him, four Iron Devourer Beasts gathering in the sky.

Marquis Giant Bamboo chuckled, glancing at the distant Bamboo Hall, sensing the aura within, and laughed, "They're still here?"

"Yes."

"Tell me briefly."

April quickly recounted some of the conversations from yesterday, including the matter of General Wen Qi.

Marquis Giant Bamboo landed, walking towards the hall, and said, "Wen Qi... Marquis Zhennan... These guys are still not giving up. It's fine if they don't give up, but they want us to be the targets. Ignore them!"

April nodded.

Marquis Giant Bamboo continued, "That guy inside, besides September, has his identity been confirmed?"

"No."

"Oh!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo nodded slightly. As he approached the hall, he slowed down a bit and asked, "How long did it take to kill those Dragon Race guys, and what were the losses here?"

"It seems none died. From start to finish... it didn't even take the time to eat a meal. In the blink of an eye, Marquis Blood Dragon and the others were killed!"

"That's really fast. Marquis Blood Dragon wasn't weak, yet he was killed so quickly."

Marquis Giant Bamboo was still a bit surprised, "So, in two instances, eight Daofuse experts died, and here, possibly none?"

"That seems to be the case!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo tapped the ground with his big bamboo, nodding, "Let's go in and talk!"

...

"Greetings, Marquis Giant Bamboo!"

The moment Marquis Giant Bamboo entered, Su Yu felt the strength of this figure!

A Heavenly King-level expert!

Marquis Giant Bamboo suddenly transformed into a middle-aged man, not maintaining his original form, and said with a smile, "Guests have arrived, make yourselves at home."

Su Yu smiled, saying nothing, and suddenly shed his Iron Devourer Beast form, returning to his original appearance.

May and the others were startled, but Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't mind, smiling, "Why has your lifespan been consumed so much?"

"A hundred years is enough!"

"Indeed."

Marquis Giant Bamboo sat down in his seat, gesturing for Su Yu to sit, and smiled, "How should I address you, friend?"

"Su Yu."

"The Emperor Yu that September mentioned?"

"More or less."

"Apologies for the neglect!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo laughed, "In ancient times, I would have had to salute you. Now, I won't be so formal, as we haven't agreed to cooperate yet."

Su Yu also laughed, "It's only right. You're being too polite, senior."

At this moment, April and the others couldn't get a word in, and September was too intimidated to speak.

Marquis Giant Bamboo glanced at Full Moon and smiled, "Little Full Moon, go get some food and drinks. Don't bring big bamboo, get some meat or something. If there's wine, bring some wine to entertain the guest. A human guest, we mustn't be too neglectful!"

Su Yu smiled, "Senior seems to have frequent dealings with the Human Race?"

"More or less."

Marquis Giant Bamboo laughed, "In ancient times, several Human Kings and Human Marquises from your race often came to chat with us. Back then, we discussed the Great Dao, as if it were yesterday. Now, things have changed, and those old friends are either dead or missing."

He smiled, "Do you know where the Culture King and the others are?"

Su Yu pondered for a moment before saying, "The Culture King and the Human Emperor might not be together. The Culture King, Martial King, and Time Sage could be facing a formidable enemy! As for the Human Emperor, he might be with some of the myriad races' council members upstream in the River of Time. Perhaps in a few years, they will return."

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo sighed, "You know quite a lot."

Su Yu chuckled, "Knowing nothing at all would be foolish, wouldn't it?"

"Do you know how many strong experts the Human Race still has?"

Su Yu smiled, "Are you including the Control King's lineage?"

"Hmm?"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo looked at him, and Su Yu smiled, "If you include that lineage, then... it's hard to say. The Human Race might still be the strongest race in the Myriad Realms!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo inhaled sharply, "Does that lineage have so many experts? I had vaguely guessed there were quite a few, but according to you, they're very strong?"

Su Yu nodded, "There are no fewer than five quasi-kings! That's my assessment."

"That's truly impressive!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo laughed, "I previously guessed there were three."

"Have you interacted with them before?" Su Yu asked, and the Marquis of Giant Bamboo laughed, "No, but there were a few times when the Human Race's experts encountered trouble, and someone notified my race to rescue them... Initially, I thought it was the Marquis of Shadows, but later I felt it wasn't! After connecting some dots, I roughly guessed, but I'm not sure of the specifics."

"They notified you to save people?"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo nodded, "Yes, why do you think that is?"

"They don't want all the Human Race's experts to die. If they all perish, the myriad races might achieve unification..."

"Isn't that ill-intentioned?"

"Sort of."

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo laughed again, "Can you match them?"

"Probably not."

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo continued, "Then, according to my view, they might not reject us. My Iron Devourer Race actually has another path, like joining them. What do you think?"

Su Yu nodded, "It's possible!"

There was a possibility that the Control King's lineage, which opposed the Culture King's legacy, might not target allied races like the Iron Devourer Race.

"Then why don't I join them instead of siding with you and taking a chance?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "It's the difference between providing timely help and adding icing on the cake."

"Then I'd rather add icing on the cake."

Su Yu smiled wryly; this was the first time he had been out-argued by a strong expert from the Iron Devourer Race.

After some thought, Su Yu added, "They might not accept outsiders. If they were inclined, they could have contacted the Iron Devourer Race thousands of years ago."

"True."

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo smiled and asked, "You were killing in the Dragon Race to frame them?"

"How did you know, senior?"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo laughed, "I'm not stupid. The Myriad Races Council is about to convene, and there's no sign of the enemy. Why hold a council? Of course, it's because there's a target, and the opponent is extremely strong, requiring cooperation from all sides. The last time a council was held was six or seven thousand years ago, and that was to deal with the Hundred Battle King."

Su Yu nodded, "That's the idea, to lure those guys out."

"Difficult!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo shook his head, warning to be cautious of two tigers fighting and ending up being the ones eliminated first!

"At this level, they won't act rashly. They might talk first and won't just start killing each other silently. Once they meet, they'll know there's a third party involved!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo continued with a smile, "If that's the case, what will you do?"

"Retreat first!"

Su Yu smiled, "The Upper Realm is hard to fight. I'll head to the Lower Realm first. If exposed, I'll return, recuperate, and fight again!"

"Do you have confidence that you can match both sides within a few years?"

"No."

Su Yu shook his head, "But I can try!"

"True, you've risen too quickly and are full of confidence in yourself. That's a good thing, but excessive confidence might not be."

At this moment, the Marquis of Giant Bamboo received a serving of food, picked up a large piece of meat, and began eating. While eating, he said, "You eat too!"

Su Yu didn't hold back, picking up some meat and starting to eat as well. The taste wasn't bad.

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo smiled, "If you want to cooperate, you must show me your strength, your confidence, and your decisions! Two points: First, take down the remaining old guys of the Human Race, whether by killing, trapping, or subduing them. Second, within ten days, I want to see your third victory! The Dragon Race... the Dragon Race is nothing. I want to see you deal with the three major races!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo bit into a piece of meat, "If you don't dare to target the three major races and only pick on other races, that's not acceptable! Once you encounter the three major races, you'll be finished! The three major races are much stronger than other races, with greater strength and deeper foundations!"

"Fighting small races is smooth sailing, but once you fight the big races, you can't fight. How can I trust you? How can I entrust the future of the Iron Devourer Race to you?"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo bit through a bone, baring his teeth, "If you don't dare to plan against the three major races and only bully the weak, then I certainly can't agree!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "What kind of results does senior want to see?"

"At least three Daofuse Realm experts. I'm not making it too difficult for you!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo grinned, "I'll give you a clue. Every time the Myriad Races Council convenes, it's held at Ren Mountain! Ren Mountain is in the central region of the Upper Realm and is an unclaimed land. Back then, the Human Race planned to use it to build the Human Emperor's Palace, but later the Human Race fell, and it was abandoned."

"There's a small palace on Ren Mountain, which is where the Myriad Races hold their council. The council hasn't officially started yet, but it's likely that strong experts from the three major races have gone there to prepare. There should be strong experts there."

"It doesn't border any of the three major races' territories, situated in a neutral zone. After all, for a meeting, nobody wants it on someone else's turf!"

"Going there, you can probably kill a few guys, but escaping will be quite difficult!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo chuckled, "As long as you kill a few strong experts from the three major races in your third attempt, and you survive, come back, and my race will support you fully. Whatever you want to do, my race has no objections!"

April and May looked at the Marquis of Giant Bamboo with admiration.

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo was indeed reliable!

He immediately gave this Emperor Yu a challenge.

If you want my race to join you, fine, go kill!

Kill strong experts from the three major races, and the location is right in the core area.

April interjected, "Although Ren Mountain is unclaimed, nearby, all three sides are territories of the three major races!"

He said heavily, "Ren Mountain is right in the core area! If you escape and your whereabouts are exposed, you'll quickly be surrounded by all three sides, and death is certain!"

September's expression changed slightly, but Su Yu was not anxious. He smiled, "If I kill three Daofuse Realm experts, will senior be willing to ally with me?"

"Of course!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo laughed, "The premise is that you're still alive! If you're dead, just pretend I never said this!"

Su Yu nodded and added, "Do I really have to take down those ancient Human Race experts? I'm not even interested in them..."

"You must take them down!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo chuckled, "If you don't, these guys will often cause trouble and ruin things!"

Su Yu sighed, "Senior, you've given me two extremely difficult tasks."

"It's not difficult if you want my race to risk their lives for you?"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo laughed, "Of course, you don't necessarily have to go to Ren Mountain. You can directly attack a race's territory, kill three Daofuse Realm experts, and then run, or simply wait on the outskirts. The three major races' Daofuse Realm experts will come out... Of course, I'm giving you only ten days! You might not have the chance to wait!"

September couldn't help but say, "Ancestor, isn't this time too short? Ten days... In ten days, we might not even have figured out the terrain."

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo said sternly, "Isn't it too reckless for the Iron Devourer Race to join the Human Race? This concerns the fate of the race! The slightest mistake could lead to the annihilation of the race. Do you think my race isn't worried?"

September was speechless.

"But..."

"No buts!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo interrupted directly, "The Lower Realm is the Lower Realm's business, and the Upper Realm is the Upper Realm's business. Even if the Lower Realm participates in the war, it's only two Daofuse Realm experts. The myriad races won't easily move against us. My race is not weak!"

He looked at Su Yu, "If Emperor Yu accomplishes this, I will keep my word, and my race will follow you! If not, don't come again!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo chuckled, "Now, all races are watching us, watching you. If you come to us repeatedly, my race might get into trouble. What do you think?"

Su Yu nodded, "I was careless."

"You weren't careless!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo continued eating, "You're confident! Well, confidence is good, just don't be arrogant! Those are the only two conditions!"

Su Yu smiled, nodded, and stood up, "Then I'll take my leave!"

He smiled and said, "September, you stay here for now."

"Sir..."

September hurriedly said, "I'll go with you."

"No need!"

Su Yu smiled, "Learn more from the Marquis of Giant Bamboo and the others! Stay here!"

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo chuckled, "September is at least Daofuse Realm. Having one more Daofuse Realm expert increases the chances of success. You're not taking him?"

"No need."

Su Yu chuckled, "Killing three Daofuse Realm experts is not like killing three quasi-kings. Having one more or one less doesn't make much difference!"

"September inherited the Devouring Great Dao from February. Seniors, please guide him more. His strength is still somewhat weak."

Su Yu looked at September and smiled, "Stay here. Next time I come, I want to see your strength improve. Being at the fifth-tier Daofuse Realm is too weak!"

September nodded solemnly, "Then... Sir, take care!"

"No worries."

Su Yu laughed, bowed to the strong experts, "I'll be back in ten days!"

With that, he quickly transformed into an Iron Devourer and walked out of the hall.

...

After Su Yu left, April said solemnly, "Marquis of Giant Bamboo, isn't sending him to Ren Mountain to kill people... a bit too dangerous?"

Even if they didn't cooperate, there was no need to set them up for failure.

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo continued eating, speaking indistinctly, "Dangerous? Then let them give up on their own! If my race is to take risks, and they don't, how is that fair? Trying to get something for nothing, expecting my race to bow down with just a few words?"

As he ate, he glanced at Jiuyue and mumbled, "The Lower Realm is the Lower Realm, and the Upper Realm is the Upper Realm! You think he's invincible in the Lower Realm, but that's the Lower Realm. In the Upper Realm, there are countless powerful beings. Can he still call the shots there?"

Jiuyue retorted defiantly, "The Dragon Clan was annihilated!"

"Foolish!" Marquis Giant Bamboo snorted, "That was because they caught the Dragon Clan off guard. Do you think he can pull off such a campaign again? The myriad races were unprepared, which is why he succeeded. Ask him if he's confident he can achieve such a victory again. The Dragon Clan is nothing; their strength isn't even half of any of the Three Great Clans! Not even a third!"

"Just because he defeated the Dragon Clan, does that mean he can wage war against the Three Great Clans?"

"Do you think there's still a lot of time left?" Marquis Giant Bamboo sneered, "There's no time! The Gate to the Lower Realm is about to fully open. Once it does, all his so-called advantages will be gone!"

Currently, Su Yu held the advantage because he controlled the passage. But once the Gate to the Lower Realm opened, that advantage would be meaningless!

Jiuyue pondered for a moment, then grinned foolishly, "It doesn't matter. I believe Emperor Yu can win! Ancestor, you've been in the Upper Realm too long; you don't understand and haven't seen it! He's capable of anything! A year ago, in the Lower Realm, the Human Race didn't have a single Daofuse Realm cultivator, while the myriad races had dozens, crushing the Human Race! A year later, the Human Race won. It's just inconvenient to alert the Upper Realm now, or else they would have unified it already!"

Jiuyue confidently declared, "I believe that in ten days, Emperor Yu will come with astonishing results!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo smiled faintly, "If he truly can, then let him. If not, he has nothing to say! Why are you so anxious?"

Jiuyue muttered a few words but said no more.

...

At this moment, Su Yu left Bamboo Mountain. He quickly and silently disappeared. Moments later, he regrouped with Lantian and the others. Lantian, with a ghostly tone, said, "That fat cat gave us a mission, Emperor Yu. Should we just get rid of him?"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless, "Get lost!"

Lantian chuckled, "Just kidding. By the way, we caught that little treasure!"

As he spoke, the Great Zhou King came forward, dragging General Wenqi along. Marquis Dingjun hurriedly followed, somewhat anxious, "Emperor Yu, Wenqi..."

Su Yu raised his hand, not giving him a chance to speak. He glanced at Wenqi, whose dao path was injured and sealed, his eyes filled with fear, confusion, and a hint of hope. Upon seeing Su Yu, his eyes flickered, and he quickly said, "Emperor Yu? I am Wenqi under the command of Marquis Zhennan. I mean no harm. I was just looking for you, but I had no opportunity..."

He indeed wanted to find this group, but Su Yu didn't say much. He glanced at him, and the Mark of Civilization appeared, directly absorbing him into it.

Marquis Dingjun wanted to speak again, but Su Yu frowned and said, "Enough, he's an insignificant character. No need to worry about him for now! Marquis Giant Bamboo has given me a challenge. If successful, the Iron Devourer Race, four... no, possibly five Daofuse Realm cultivators will join us, including two Heavenly King-level experts, one second-tier Daofuse, and one third-tier Daofuse from April and May!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Such a force cannot be abandoned! It's even stronger than our current strength!"

As for Wenqi, he could be ignored for now! Compared to the Iron Devourer Race, he was insignificant.

Su Yu recounted Marquis Giant Bamboo's words, and instantly, the Great Zhou King and the Great Ming King both had headaches.

This time, it would be their third strike! This wasn't like before when the myriad races were unprepared. Moreover, they weren't targeting minor clans' Daofuse cultivators but those of the Three Great Clans. The Daofuse cultivators of the Three Great Clans were either in their dojos, in the mountains, or at the source of the dao.

All were incredibly dangerous places!

Killing there would require at least three Daofuse cultivators. If they got trapped, Su Yu and his group would be doomed.

The Great Zhou King and others all looked at Su Yu. This was truly a difficult task.

Su Yu also stroked his chin in thought. They couldn't act rashly; if they did, the entire army could be wiped out. It wasn't impossible.

Marquis Giant Bamboo... these two conditions made it difficult even for Su Yu.
