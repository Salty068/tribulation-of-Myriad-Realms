Chapter 855: Even the Culture King Needs Face (Subscription Request)

With Su Yu's rapid rise in strength, the Human Emperor was starting to feel anxious. If this continued, he would soon become obsolete. Su Yu's progress was simply too fast!

Of course, what concerned him more was the number of paths Su Yu's world had opened. Even if the Culture King had given him benefits, it was impossible for every power of the Great Dao to correspond to Su Yu's paths unless Su Yu had an extraordinary number of them. How did this kid manage it?

It was only at this moment that the Human Emperor began to observe Su Yu's subordinates closely. After a long period of observation and judgment, he reached a conclusion: Su Yu's subordinates were cultivating the same world as Su Yu!

Yes, they were cultivating together, which meant their insights were actually shared! Su Yu knew their insights, and they knew his. The Human Emperor was aware of this cultivation method, but it had both advantages and disadvantages. 

For instance, if these people became powerful, it would be easy for them to seize the Great Dao and use it for themselves, as Su Yu had opened the entire power of the Great Dao to them. Moreover, if many of Su Yu's strong subordinates chose to betray him, it could lead to Su Yu's world being taken over, with their combined weight possibly outweighing Su Yu's.

The Human Emperor kept assessing the situation but couldn't help but admire Su Yu's decisiveness and boldness. Su Yu seemed to understand the risks but didn't appear too concerned. For someone as domineering as Su Yu, the possibility of his world being overturned was something he surprisingly accepted.

"Is it the principle of 'those who gain the Dao have many helpers, while those who lose it have few'?"

It was only now that the Human Emperor vaguely understood some of Su Yu's thoughts. If all his subordinates betrayed him, it would mean Su Yu had failed to the extreme. At that point, his world would rise and fall with these people. At that time, Su Yu might not even care about a piece of heaven and earth!

The Human Emperor pondered continuously. Su Yu! Perhaps he could learn something from Su Yu's approach. As for the Radiant King and others of the first rank, unless they surpassed the first rank, it would be difficult for them to regain their current strength. But if they were below the first rank, integrating into the world wouldn't have too much impact.

Various thoughts emerged in the Human Emperor's mind. At this moment, he no longer had thoughts of dying. Damn it, he needed to become stronger! As a super strong individual, with all his experience and insights, he could recover quickly. However, he was worried that before he could recover, this brat Su Yu might actually surpass him.

"Impossible!"

The Human Emperor thought to himself, Su Yu had no idea how strong he had been back then! In those days, he was terrifyingly powerful. When dealing with the myriad races, it was only due to various unexpected factors that he couldn't take them down. Otherwise, he could have taken on ten first-rank experts at once!

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, he also worried a bit. Su Yu was likely expanding the Heaven Gate now, which might not be a good thing. Forget it, he wouldn't worry about it for now. The second Culture King was still over there, alive, and should have a way to handle it.

...

Meanwhile, in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu's world was expanding crazily, but he frowned. It wasn't because the expansion wasn't powerful enough, but because he felt that after the fusion of the Great Dao, his world was expanding too much!

"So, the people inside the gate want to come in because of this?"

To enhance their strength? Or to perfect the Great Dao?

Su Yu speculated, murmuring to himself, "Using the Great Dao of the Myriad Realms as yang, and the Dao of the Three Gates as yin? This is the Heaven Gate's Great Dao. In the Earth Gate, it seems to be all chaotic Great Dao. Could it be that chaotic Great Dao also has yin and yang divisions? And what about the Human Gate?"

Thoughts kept emerging in Su Yu's mind. If the strong ones from the Heaven Gate came out and appeared in the Myriad Realms, found the corresponding power of the Great Dao, and fused with it, would they also become stronger instantly?

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "So, when they come out, will they try to kill the strong ones on the same path?"

A struggle for the Dao!

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly had some enlightenment. This was the struggle for the Dao! A struggle on the same path of the Great Dao! All on the River of Time!

"What about the world?"

His own world's Great Dao was different from the River of Time's Great Dao, but it also belonged to the yang aspect. Would it also be coveted by others? Would they devour the world?

After he fused with the power of the Great Dao behind these gates, Su Yu vaguely understood something. The Three Gates, three eras, how could the old era return? How could it become the master of the world again?

By replacing it!

Previously, the Human Emperor said that the people in the Three Gates were all enemies. At that time, Su Yu thought it was about seizing power. Now he understood it wasn't about seizing power; it was about seizing the Dao!

Su Yu closed his eyes, a struggle for the Dao!

The Dao of the old era had become the past. The Three Body Method... seemed to be a similar principle. Strictly speaking, these people only existed in the past. To return to the present, they had to seize the Dao of the current strong ones, equivalent to merging with the present!

"The inspiration for the Three Body Method should come from this point!"

At this moment, Su Yu had more insights into the Three Body Method. The inspiration for the Three Body Method must have come from this. And this also represented something extremely terrifying: the existence within the Three Gates... no, especially the existence within the Heaven Gate, once they appeared, they would inevitably turn against the strong ones of the Myriad Realms!

And the strong ones of the Myriad Realms were actually coveting their Dao too!

"Either they devour us, or we devour them... a struggle for the Dao!"

Su Yu licked his lips. Interesting! Why did this Great Dao have two sides of yin and yang? Being on the same path of the River of Time, where did the deviation occur? The gates?

Thoughts kept emerging, and the expansion of the world also stopped. Su Yu took a closer look. At this moment, his entire world encompassed more than half of the Upper Realm, almost covering it entirely except for some dead corners!

And only now did Su Yu feel that he had truly become stronger! Not only stronger but much stronger.

This was the power of the rules accumulated by the Culture King over many years. Perhaps initially, it was to perfect his own world, but he couldn't output these rules, which ended up benefiting Su Yu.

With a wave of his hand, Su Yu vaguely felt it. At this moment, in his world, the power of the Great Dao condensed. As Su Yu made a move, the Great Dao gathered, and gradually, Su Yu could feel his strength growing significantly. Vaguely, around him, about 20 small golden dragons were swimming.

Those were the shadows of the Great Dao!

"20 paths of power?"

Su Yu felt it, roughly judged, and it seemed to be about that many. With a wave of his hand, Su Yu dispersed these small golden dragons. This was the power gathered when making a full-force move. If he wanted to show off, he could keep them around, but only a fool would do that.

Wouldn't that just expose his strength at a glance?

A strong person should be mysterious. One that others couldn't see through! If they could see through you, would you still be considered strong?

"20 paths of power..."

Su Yu muttered to himself. This strength was much stronger than before. After reaching 16 paths, every increase in power was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. This time, he absorbed these powers of the Great Dao and actually improved significantly in his world!

And outside the world, Su Yu instantly teleported out. He also reached out and grabbed, and around him, 16 small golden dragons vaguely appeared, and the 17th was also faintly visible.

Su Yu smiled.

So, in the outside world, without the support of the world, I am also considered a first-rank expert. First-rank... isn't that hard!

Suddenly, he found that first-rank seemed quite simple.

Su Yu laughed, but then he became a bit solemn. His rapid improvement was due to him overdrawing some of his future potential! The Three Body Method, merging past and future. Su Yu had merged!

He had also merged with some opposing powers of the Great Dao within the Heaven Gate, which many people hadn't done. Had the Human Emperor done it? Had he absorbed it?

If not... it meant that once the Heaven Gate opened, many people inside and outside the Heaven Gate could improve. The premise was to find the corresponding Great Dao and kill the opponent. At that time, even if Su Yu killed them, he might not be able to achieve the same improvement as now.

"So... I must enter before the Heaven Gate opens!"

At this moment, Su Yu made a decision. He couldn't wait for the Heaven Gate to open and then deal with those people. He had to enter the Heaven Gate first, while the opponents hadn't merged with the Great Dao of the Myriad Realms and hadn't improved, to eliminate all the main opponents!

Even if he couldn't eliminate them all, he had to take out the main ones to ensure that even if the Heaven Gate opened and they improved, he wouldn't fear them!

As Su Yu thought about these things, his aura began to fluctuate! It also started to stabilize!

At this time, the Great Zhou King and others quickly arrived. Just as they were about to congratulate him, Su Yu suddenly revealed his Heaven Gate!

That Heaven Gate was much more solid than before!

Su Yu shouted in a low voice, and the power of ten thousand paths surged out. The 360 acupoints of the physical body and the 360 divine apertures all appeared, with 720 light points shining with the brilliance of the sun!

The entire Heaven Gate began to expand!

"Open!"

A low shout echoed through the heavens and earth!

With a rumble, the Heaven Gate seemed to grow larger again. Not only that, but faintly, a small crack appeared on the projection of the Heaven Gate!

This crack could only allow Su Yu and the opposite side to inject some power.

This was the limitation of the Heaven Gate projection. If it were the true Heaven Gate, opening a crack would be like the Gate of Hell opening a crack, allowing almost anyone to find a way in and out!

In an instant, the Heaven Gate was greatly expanded by Su Yu!

...

At the same time.

Inside the Heaven Gate.

In the distance of the Heaven Gate, Gui suddenly felt a movement in his heart, vaguely sensing something, and raised his eyebrows slightly. What was happening?

At this moment, he was controlling his avatar to understand the Myriad Realms while also probing some information about Su Yu, knowing oneself and the enemy to negotiate terms with Su Yu.

But now, Gui suddenly felt a bit uneasy.

What happened?

He quickly returned to the projection area of Su Yu's Heaven Gate and soon felt something unusual. Su Yu's Heaven Gate projection, which was previously almost invisible, now seemed to be more solid.

At this moment, it seemed as though something had solidified. Had the Heaven Gate been stabilized? Gui furrowed his brows slightly. Could it be that Su Yu had grown stronger?

He pondered for a moment and extended a bit of his power. Just as he did, Su Yu's voice echoed, "Gui, you're back? Did you bring the rule fragments?"

Gui's face stiffened. "Nonsense, I just left for a short while. Where would I get fragments from?"

"Su Yu, what is this about...?"

Su Yu's voice carried a hint of arrogance and pride, "This Emperor has reached the third tier!"

"Four paths of power!"

Su Yu laughed wildly, "Gui, didn't expect that, did you? I tricked you. Some of the power of laws sent by the Culture King, I actually absorbed a portion of it. Did you really think I wouldn't use any of it?"

"......"

Gui was speechless. Of course, he knew! Su Yu would definitely absorb some of what suited him. That was a given. However, Su Yu's rapid advancement to the third tier was surprising. Previously, Su Yu was only at the fourth tier, and now he had quickly entered the third tier, indicating his fast fusion speed and excellent aptitude.

So that's how it is! Entering the third tier, no wonder Su Yu's tone today was different, even more arrogant than before!

Gui sensed the Heaven Gate and laughed, "Congratulations!"

Su Yu's voice came again, chuckling, "Congratulations? Gui, I've discovered something... For instance, I cultivate the path of the physical body, and so do you. But you and I are yin and yang... So, if I devour you, or you devour me, there would be a significant boost, right? Gui, this Heaven Gate is truly interesting. You and I, destined to be enemies, are actually cooperating at this moment!"

Gui's expression changed slightly! Yes, Su Yu had absorbed some power of laws, which meant he had indeed discovered some issues. This was something Gui had overlooked before.

Gui quickly laughed, "Misunderstanding. Since you and I are partners, how could it be like that? Besides, there are many who cultivate the path of the physical body, not just you and me. In the myriad realms, within this gate, many cultivate the physical body path. This isn't a unique path. A great dao can have many variations, and a slight difference makes it a new path..."

He still explained a bit, not wanting Su Yu to misunderstand that he intended to devour him.

Su Yu sneered but didn't dwell on it, saying indifferently, "Gui, if you have the ability, then descend upon the Myriad Realms first! By the time you descend, I might be at the first tier! For now, we're using each other, so there's no need to dwell on these things. Help me with one more thing..."

Gui immediately frowned, "Su Yu, I've agreed to all your requests, but I'm not your subordinate..."

"It's nothing difficult!"

Su Yu said coldly, "Just help me deliver something to the Culture King!"

"Hmm?"

Gui furrowed his brows slightly. What was it?

"What?"

"A pair of shoes!"

Su Yu said calmly, "They were the Culture King's weapon from years ago. He left them in the Myriad Realms and didn't take them. Now, the Culture King might be having a hard time. Returning these shoes to him might help him improve and face strong enemies."

A pair of shoes? A weapon?

Gui thought for a moment and said, "Material objects might be hard to project through the Heaven Gate's shadow. Previously, we only projected some power of laws..."

"Give it a try. At this level, weapons aren't purely material anymore!"

Su Yu said lightly, "Do me this favor. You should know, encountering a generous Heaven Gate Master like me is rare! You want to condense a clone, I'll let you do it, and I won't even bother with your clone! You want to add people, I'll let you add people... Gui, you should know, besides me, who else would be so reckless and agree to your requests so easily?"

Gui silently complained, so you know you're reckless!

At this moment, Gui couldn't help but test the waters, saying directly, "Su Yu, aren't you worried at all?"

Aren't you afraid I'll descend upon the Myriad Realms?

Su Yu's voice, filled with arrogance, coldly laughed, "The Heaven Gate will open sooner or later, Gui. Don't pretend with me. You're probably just a minor character in the Heaven Gate. Now, I'm using you to improve myself, and you're using me... We both benefit. If we don't take a risk, how can we compete with the big shots? In this struggle for the great dao, are we destined to just watch and be small characters? I'm not willing. You've cultivated to this level, are you willing?"

Not willing! 

One sentence left Gui silent. Was he willing? Of course not! Otherwise, he wouldn't have taken the risk to find the Culture King and fulfill Su Yu's request, just to keep Su Yu's Heaven Gate open.

After considering for a while, Gui sighed, "This is the last time! Su Yu, I don't know what you and the Culture King are doing, but I can sense it's very dangerous. You have me running between you and the Culture King, not only am I in danger... you're in danger too!"

"Me?"

Su Yu was puzzled, and Gui explained, "The Culture King and Martial King are being watched by a supreme being! If I keep going back and forth between the Culture King and you... I'll eventually be discovered! Once discovered... I'll be captured soon, and even through me, they'll find your Heaven Gate projection! Su Yu, you must understand, such a powerful being, even if you don't guide them... they have ways to forcibly descend upon your Heaven Gate... At that time, even if it's not their true self, just a projection, you're doomed!"

"Such an existence, even a projection clone, might possess second-tier power, or even stronger... As long as your portal can't be closed, they can even project first-tier power into it!"

Gui worriedly said, "If we encounter such an existence, you and I will be in huge trouble, so it's best not to have any contact with the Culture King anymore!"

It was the truth, though somewhat exaggerated. The one from the Eternal Life Mountain might not discover him, and even if they did, they might not find Su Yu's Heaven Gate projection. However, to prevent Su Yu from constantly asking him to meet the Culture King, he had to warn Su Yu. This was a very dangerous matter! Frequent contact with the Culture King would eventually lead to big trouble. He was worried, worried about the Eternal Life Mountain, and worried about any schemes Su Yu and the Culture King might have, even though their current interactions were through him, seemingly harmless.

The only thing was that some power of laws had been given to Su Yu. Even if messages were conveyed through him, he listened, and there was no problem. But as a first-tier expert, there was still some sense of danger, that was called danger!

...

At this moment, Su Yu raised his eyebrows slightly. As he walked towards the lower realm, he transmitted his voice, "So, a powerful existence, once they find my portal, can forcibly descend?"

"Yes!"

Gui added, "Of course, not their true self!"

Su Yu laughed, "What about you? A powerful existence can't descend through my Heaven Gate with their true self, only through the real Heaven Gate. But can someone like you descend through my Heaven Gate?"

"No, I can't!"

Gui felt a bit guilty but still explained forcefully, "I can't either. I can only descend through the real gate. Here, I can only descend a clone, and the more power projected, the stronger the clone..."

Yes, that's it! Anyway, Su Yu wouldn't know the truth!

Su Yu sneered, no need to ask, he could definitely descend with his true self. At this moment, he roughly understood the function of the Heaven Gate. As the guide, Su Yu could guide a powerful being to descend with their true self, perhaps even more than one!

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Gui, tell me the truth, can I enter the Heaven Gate?"

Gui raised his eyebrows, "The Heaven Gate is too dangerous, Su Yu..."

"So, I can enter?"

Su Yu already knew that the Human Emperor seemed to have had this plan in the past but was repelled and had to retreat. Moreover... the Martial King and Culture King had both entered, right?

Su Yu laughed, "The Culture King and others entered through the Heaven Gate back then, right? But why can't they come out?"

This was what Su Yu was concerned about! Being able to enter but not exit would be troublesome!

Gui thought for a moment and explained, "That's how it is inside the gate. You can enter but not exit. Inside the gate... it's considered a place of imprisonment, a place of sealing!"

Can enter but not exit? That would indeed be troublesome. To come out, one would have to wait for the Heaven Gate to open?

Various thoughts surfaced, and Su Yu said no more, stating calmly, "I know you have difficulties and concerns, but... just this once. Help me deliver these shoes to the Culture King, and after that, you won't need to run back and forth anymore!"

The boots represented some core paths of heaven and earth. Although not the entire heaven and earth were guided over, as long as the Culture King was willing, he could extract a portion of the power of heaven and earth through these boots. And Su Yu, as long as he opened the Heaven Gate for the Culture King when he extracted it, the Culture King could naturally cover himself with the power of heaven and earth.

Even at critical moments, Su Yu could borrow some of the Culture King's power of heaven and earth.

Gui pondered for a moment and said solemnly, "Su Yu, this is the last time... I want to cooperate with you, but I don't want to die! The Culture King's enemies are too strong!"

Su Yu laughed and suddenly retorted, "Really? How strong? Much stronger than the Culture King, yet they haven't killed him after all these years? The Human Emperor is stronger than the Culture King, so does that mean the Human Emperor and the opponent are about the same? Didn't you say you could rival the Human Emperor?"

"......"

This... damn!

Gui's face turned green. This was a slap in the face. He mumbled, "That's not what I meant. Xingyu... Xingyu shouldn't be as strong as the Culture King..."

This was about face. Once the big words were out, could he take them back?

He added, "I'm not afraid of that one, just... there's no need to fall out, right?"

Su Yu laughed, "Nonsense!"

He thought for a moment and said, "The one you're talking about, according to the division of the great dao, how many paths of power do they have?"

"That, I don't know..."

Su Yu was speechless, "Then how many paths of power do you have?"

"Secret!"

"......"

Alright, got it. Because you don't understand how strong those at that level are, the more you say, the more mistakes you'll make!

Su Yu stopped asking questions. He knew that pressing further would only lead to more nonsense from this guy, which would just cloud his judgment.

"Alright, just this once, the last time!"

...

Su Yu said no more. At this moment, he once again arrived at the Sea of Stars. The Book Spirit appeared instantly, holding a pair of boots and panting slightly. "I've imprinted the core of the world on these boots. It's an extension of myself... Please, Your Majesty!"

When the Culture King left back then, he didn't take the world with him, likely having his own plans. Later, when he entered the Heaven Gate, his own Heaven Gate was probably isolated, unable to draw power until now. Only through Su Yu could he finally channel the power of the world.

As for the Radiant King and the Human Emperor, they had always been upstream and couldn't channel the power of the world for him. The Book Spirit understood these reasons. So now, the only one who could help the Culture King was Su Yu!

"A small matter!" Su Yu smiled. "The Culture King being alive is a good thing. He can help us hold back the powerful beings of the Heaven Gate."

Saying this, he picked up the boots. At this moment, the boots were gold-edged and black-faced, somewhat similar to Su Yu's own. Su Yu suddenly chuckled, waved his hand, and the boots turned white. The Book Spirit was taken aback, and Su Yu laughed, "Give him a pair of white shoes, it suits his style!"

The Book Spirit was amused but said nothing. Just because the Culture King liked wearing white robes didn't mean he liked white shoes. These were trivial matters, and he didn't bother to comment further.

Su Yu quickly manifested the boots into the Heaven Gate. Transmitting them over wasn't easy. However, Su Yu was indeed powerful enough now. After spending some time and energy, the Great Dao trembled, and a small crack appeared in the Heaven Gate. Soon, the boots were transmitted into the Heaven Gate!

...

At the same time, the Culture King's eyes flickered as he suddenly turned to look at a certain place, a smile appearing in his eyes. "I found it!"

"What?" the Martial King asked curiously.

The Culture King beamed but didn't reply. I found the projection of Su Yu's Heaven Gate! I felt it, felt the power of my world. Su Yu, this guy, is quite capable. In such a short time, he managed to open his own world, summon back the Book Spirit, and even transmit a core of his world over.

Su Yu is stronger than I imagined!

He raised an eyebrow slightly, looked at the Martial King, and after a while, said, "Next time, don't say Su Yu is my son, or else... you'll be in danger!"

"Hmm?" The Martial King chuckled, "Don't say that. You're making it sound like I'm not as good as him. You should know, I'm just a tiny bit away from reaching that realm. You might not even be as strong as me here..."

"Heh!" The Culture King sneered, "Alright, as long as you're happy!"

At this moment, the Culture King was all smiles. My power of the world can now extend over. Su Yu should understand my intention. Since he has now channeled my power of the world, it means the Myriad Realms have been pacified, and no one will notice anything unusual about my world.

His world was in the Sea of Stars. If there were many powerful beings in the Myriad Realms, Su Yu should understand why the Culture King did this, who he was scheming against. If exposed, it would be a loss.

Now, however, Su Yu had straightforwardly channeled the power of the world over, indicating one thing: the Myriad Realms have been pacified!

The Culture King exhaled, his smile radiant. "The Myriad Realms are at peace!"

"..." The Martial King looked bewildered. How did you figure that out? Earlier, you said the Myriad Realms were troublesome and dangerous. Now, not long after, you're saying they're at peace... You're too fickle!

The Culture King laughed again, "Big Brother's side shouldn't be a big problem now! But it's hard to say... Let's see how Su Yu arranges things."

The Martial King's mouth twitched.

The Culture King continued, "The Heaven Gate hasn't opened yet. Big Brother and the others should still be blocking the gate upstream, preventing the Myriad Races from returning... Is Su Yu in the Myriad Realms now, or has he not gone to see Big Brother?"

He pondered for a moment and quickly said, "He should have gone! This means Su Yu might have resolved some troubles, thinking Big Brother's side isn't under too much pressure, so he returned to the Myriad Realms?"

This was some of his reasoning. Su Yu was so powerful now, he couldn't have not gone upstream! He must have gone and helped Big Brother resolve significant troubles, thinking the danger wasn't too great, so he returned to the Myriad Realms, seeking ways to enhance himself, thereby contacting me.

The method of channeling through the Heaven Gate should have been passed to him by Big Brother.

The Culture King judged again and said, "Now, Big Brother's side should be balanced with the Myriad Races' strength. Su Yu is eager to break through, to break this balance!"

The Martial King was dumbfounded. Did you leave a clone in the Myriad Realms? Otherwise, you're just guessing!

We've been together all this time, and whatever you say goes?

The Culture King ignored him, walking towards the periphery, saying, "We can't waste time anymore. Whether Big Brother wins or loses, he'll soon return to the Myriad Realms... By then, the Heaven Gate will surely open!"

"We've wasted too much time..."

The Culture King sighed and said, "Su Yu's strength is also rapidly increasing. The situation with the Myriad Races is still unclear. Have they been expelled, or killed?"

Every word made sense to the Martial King, but he was genuinely confused. Are you just guessing, or do you really know? You speak as if it's true, yet you're not in the Myriad Realms, and you've deduced the situation there?

The Culture King ignored him. Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate and transmitted the power of the world over. Just this was enough for him to deduce many things.

There were many clues.

The Martial King was too lazy to think, so he couldn't guess these things.

The Culture King walked all the way to the edge, raising an eyebrow slightly, "Go, cause trouble for the Mountain of Eternal Life! Make a big commotion, and run after you're done!"

"Oh!" The Martial King didn't know why he had to cause trouble now, but... I like causing trouble!

In the next moment, the Martial King shot out, heading straight for the Mountain of Eternal Life.

The Culture King stood still.

In the blink of an eye, a loud boom resounded. In the distance, the Martial King's body suddenly projected into the world, enormous and powerful. With a punch, he shattered the sky, roaring, "Release Wenyu, or I'll kill you all!"

Boom!

The massive sound echoed through the heavens.

At this moment, in the distance, Gui's face was filled with dread. They're fighting? Run!

He was about to flee when the Culture King's voice reached his ears, "Give me the shoes, and you can leave!"

Gui's face changed dramatically!

This time, he was here in person, without time to split his body. After all, he was still on the periphery, and the Culture King... discovered him!

He was terrified!

Shoes?

Yes, these shoes. He hurriedly threw them down and ran, cursing in his heart. Su Yu, this bastard, what are you and the Culture King up to? I checked these shoes, and there's nothing unusual!

Yet, the Culture King sensed it in advance!

My god, this is too dangerous!

If the Culture King wanted to find me, to kill me, wouldn't it be easy?

The shoes he had thrown down vanished instantly, and the Culture King's voice echoed in Gui's ears again, "Tell Su Yu not to contact me again. It's too dangerous. You too, be careful not to be discovered!"

He showed concern for Gui, fearing he might be exposed, and added, "If you have trouble, you can come to me, provided I have time to help you..."

Gui's face turned purple!

What do you mean?

Do I need your protection?

The Culture King said nothing more, silently watching him leave. In an instant, a pair of white shoes appeared at his feet.

The Culture King laughed!

At this moment, dressed in white clothes and white shoes, he looked somewhat dashing, his long hair flowing. The Culture King felt the power transmitted from beneath his feet and chuckled softly, "Mountain of Eternal Life..."

He turned his head to look. After all these years, you've suppressed me, and it felt good, didn't it?

The Culture King's smile was radiant, and he vanished instantly.

Time was running out!

I must resolve the troubles here quickly. Otherwise, if Su Yu and Big Brother really come, and I'm still entangled with the Mountain of Eternal Life, it would be too embarrassing.

These days, we scholars, mingling in the world, care about nothing but face, don't we?

Su Yu has pacified the Myriad Realms, Big Brother has dealt with the powerful beings of the Myriad Races, and if I can't even take down the Heaven Gate, and a single Mountain of Eternal Life blocks me, how embarrassing would it be when the Three Gates open and I return to the Myriad Realms?
