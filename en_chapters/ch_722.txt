Chapter 722: The Battle Approaches (Requesting Subscriptions)

Gather the generals and give it your all. Even a lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit, let alone when those opponents are far from being mere rabbits. With eight Heavenly King-level experts in a perilous location, unexpected changes might occur, and Su Yu needed to consider all these factors.

...

They waited in place for an entire day. Grandstar and the Great Ming King arrived first, followed cautiously by Marquis Dingjun and Chongming, their auras fluctuating violently, indicating they hadn't had an easy time recently. Except for September, everyone else was present.

On Su Yu's side, there were seven Daofuse Realm experts. With Yunshui Marquis, General Yingwu, Shadow Marquis, and Huoyun Marquis, they had a total of eleven Daofuse experts. However, only Su Yu and Lantian were at the Heavenly King level. The Great Zhou King and Huoyun Marquis were at the peak of Daofuse, considered second-tier Daofuse, while Yunshui Marquis and Shadow Marquis were close to this level. General Yingwu and Marquis Dingjun were third-tier Daofuse. The Great Ming King, Grandstar, and Chongming had not long advanced to Daofuse, not the weakest sixth-tier, but around fifth-tier.

With such strength, dreaming of killing eight Heavenly Kings was pure folly. It was akin to courting death! When they had dealt with the East Heavenly King before, multiple Daofuse experts had joined forces and nearly got wiped out.

...

In the valley, upon hearing Su Yu's plan to kill eight Heavenly Kings, Marquis Dingjun kept taking deep breaths, but he said nothing. Having fought alongside Su Yu against the Dragon Race once, he knew Su Yu was extremely cautious and not the type to recklessly throw his life away. If Su Yu proposed such a plan, he must have some confidence.

The Great Ming King and Grandstar remained silent, waiting for Su Yu's battle plan. General Yingwu and the others glanced at the Great Ming King and Grandstar. Seeing that they didn't object to the idea of killing eight Heavenly Kings, they were secretly shocked by Su Yu's control. After all, these were Daofuse experts, and from the surface, it seemed like a suicide mission. Yet, none of the Daofuse experts objected or questioned it, not even Marquis Dingjun.

At this moment, General Yingwu could no longer believe his previous assumptions. What puppet? Nonsense! Of course, it was possible that Su Yu had only brought his trusted forces this time. General Yingwu could only comfort himself, thinking, "Maybe he can't control the lower realm, and everyone there opposes him. He's still quite pitiful!" He even imagined Su Yu being ostracized and forced to flee to the upper realm because he couldn't survive in the lower realm. Of course, it was just imagination, a way to comfort himself, or else he'd feel too foolish.

...

Everyone had arrived. Su Yu didn't say much. At this moment, he began to reveal a map on the ground. The map gradually expanded, bit by bit, as if it were real, only scaled down countless times.

"I am presenting the Source of the Dao at a scale of one in ten thousand," Su Yu said. Mountains emerged on the map, rivers appeared, forests were depicted, everything seemed real. Everyone looked at the map he presented.

Outside the map, Su Yu marked a red dot and said in a deep voice, "This is our current location. Everyone, take a good look and remember it. You're all Daofuse experts, don't tell me you can't discern directions."

Everyone silently watched, saying nothing. Soon, Su Yu waved his hand, and a mountain turned blood-red in an instant. Su Yu said solemnly, "Our target is this!"

Shadow Marquis glanced at it, identified it, and said, "This is the Primordial Mountain, rumored to have existed since ancient times..."

"It's now called the Sealed Mountain!" Su Yu corrected, saying in a deep voice, "And this is where the Hundred Battle King is rumored to be sealed."

The expressions of several people changed. General Yingwu frowned and asked, "The place where the Hundred Battle King is sealed? Does the Human Lord mean our goal is to unseal the Hundred Battle King this time?"

She frowned and said, "If we really want to unseal him, it's not impossible. After all, the Hundred Battle King is part of the Human Race! But if we're risking our lives for the Hundred Battle King... I don't agree!"

Unsealing the Hundred Battle King wasn't out of the question. But now, to unseal him, they had to deal with eight Heavenly Kings, which was a suicide mission. She didn't want to agree. The others remained silent, saying nothing. Unsealing the Hundred Battle King... the Hundred Battle King had been their spiritual support before. But now, seeing the situation improving, suddenly risking their lives for the Hundred Battle King left them somewhat dissatisfied.

Su Yu ignored them and continued, "Around this Sealed Mountain, there are eight Heavenly King-level experts! Six of them are responsible for sealing the Hundred Battle King with their Daos, and two should be mobile forces!"

Su Yu marked several red dots around and said, "These are their positions. Of course, positions can change at any time, so just take a look. Even if they separate, they can regroup instantly."

Everyone observed carefully and silently memorized it. Eight Heavenly Kings! A terrifying number! The Hundred Battle King was actually sealed by eight Heavenly King-level experts!

"Our slogan is to rescue the Hundred Battle King!" Su Yu said again. Lantian suddenly chuckled. Su Yu glared at him, and Lantian instantly transformed into a little girl. He found that Su Yu was more tolerant of the little girl version of Lantian. Soon, Lantian giggled and said, "I know, the slogan is to rescue the Hundred Battle King, got it!"

It was just a slogan! Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him and said solemnly, "Remember, we are the Chaos Race! The Chaos Race once came to rescue him but failed, so now we're here for a second rescue attempt!"

"Also, the planner of this rescue mission, remember the name, is Ziyan!" Su Yu said seriously, "Remember it well! During the battle, if there's no time to clean up the scene, some willpower might remain. True experts can trace back some of the clearest information we remember through this residual willpower!"

"Of course, it can often be disrupted or deceived, and people won't take it too seriously, but... Ziyan is our mastermind, remember this well!"

Ziyan! Several people noted the name, Ziyan... The Great Zhou King and the others already understood that Su Yu was planning to shift the blame to someone else again. The West King's Consort! The Chaos Race, Ziyan, this was the purpose of this operation. As for rescuing the Hundred Battle King, the Great Zhou King dismissed it as nonsense. As Su Yu said, it's just a slogan, don't take it seriously.

Su Yu continued, "This time, Lantian and I will only deal with two Heavenly Kings, the mobile ones! The remaining six are up to you!"

"..."

The group looked at each other, their expressions strange. There were quite a few of them, nine excluding Su Yu and Lantian! But are you sure nine of us can handle six Heavenly Kings? The Great Zhou King and Huoyun Marquis weren't weak. With them as two cores, they might have a chance against two Heavenly Kings, but six... they might as well wash their necks and wait to be killed!

Su Yu didn't care and continued, "Let me explain the situation briefly. These six are using their Daos to seal the Hundred Battle King, and the Hundred Battle King is resisting, so these six will definitely be somewhat restrained!"

This reassured several people a bit. The fiery-tempered Huoyun Marquis also relaxed a little and said, "Now there's some hope! But even if six Heavenly Kings are sealing the Hundred Battle King, their strength might not be weaker than mine! Zhou Tiansheng and I might be able to handle one each... but for the other four... can the seven of them handle it?"

Huoyun Marquis continued, "Even if they can, it's impossible to kill them!"

"In a situation where the strength is similar, resisting, defeating, and killing are three completely different concepts. With similar strength, in most cases, to quickly kill, it requires three against one!"

This was the experience from years of battle. With similar strength and not much difference, to quickly kill the opponent, it required three experts of the same level to surround and kill the opponent to achieve a quick kill. It's not that two Heavenly Kings can't determine life and death, they can, but it takes time. They're all Heavenly Kings, and perhaps after three days of battle, life and death would be determined. This premise is based on a one-on-one fight or no interference from others.

Huoyun Marquis, after all, was a top-tier Daofuse expert, capable of fighting Heavenly King-level experts at Divine Fire Mountain. At this moment, he said heavily, "I can handle one, Zhou Tiansheng can handle one, Yunshui and Yingwu together might handle one. Shadow and Dingjun together can handle one. As for... the Great Ming King, Grandstar, and Chongming... it's difficult, but they might be able to hold one... even so, the strength is still insufficient!"

Shadow Marquis also said softly, "Or Yunshui with Grandstar, Dingjun with Chongming and Yingwu, I with the Great Ming King... these can be adjusted, but there are six Heavenly Kings we need to deal with, and it's too difficult!"

Not enough strength! That's the first point. Secondly, Shadow Marquis sighed, "Even with such combinations, even if the opponents are restrained by the Hundred Battle King, we can only resist, not kill. Once entangled, the Source of the Dao is not our territory, and soon, we'll be surrounded and killed by myriad race experts!"

No matter how they calculated, they couldn't fight. Su Yu stroked his chin, thought for a moment, and asked, "Do you think if I go to rescue the Hundred Battle King, will Marquis Zhennan and Wen Qi listen?"

Several people's eyes flickered as they looked at him. Yunshui Marquis said softly, "Marquis Zhennan was captured by the Human Lord, and he might be full of resentment... but if he can go to rescue the Hundred Battle King, he might be willing! Marquis Zhennan was also one of the staunch supporters of the Hundred Battle King. If we have him and Wen Qi... then we might be able to deal with six Heavenly Kings!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Will he betray me? For example, during the battle, will he turn against me, or simply reveal my identity? I used the Human Lord Seal against him, and if he betrays me... some of my plans will fall apart."

Using Marquis Zhennan was something Su Yu was reluctant to do, but to achieve a successful kill, he might really need to borrow Marquis Zhennan's strength. After all, he was a top-tier Daofuse expert!

Marquis Huoyun spoke in a deep voice, "It's unlikely. Marquis Zhennan isn't a traitor. If he were, he would have defected to the Myriad Races long ago! I understand that the Human Lord might have some biases against us, but those are internal matters. When it comes to external threats... I believe Marquis Zhennan will act without hesitation!"

"Marquis Zhennan may have many flaws—he's rebellious, doesn't like to be controlled, and refuses to accept other Human Lords. However, if it's about rescuing the Hundred Battle King, Marquis Zhennan will undoubtedly give it his all!"

Su Yu remained silent for a moment before speaking again, "This time, my plan is to avoid splitting up in battle to prevent any mishaps. We will fight as a team!"

"A team battle?"

Everyone was surprised and somewhat shaken. Even the Great Zhou King couldn't help but say, "This... Are you suggesting that we gather all six Heavenly Kings together, or perhaps lure them into one place? Emperor Yu, if they join forces, their combined strength will be even greater! If we separate them, we might have a chance. But if they unite, there will be no hope at all!"

Even he was a bit shaken at this moment. Was Su Yu planning to annihilate them all together? It seemed too far-fetched!

Su Yu said solemnly, "Concentrate and annihilate! Moreover, if they are concentrated, even if someone makes a mistake, there will be a chance to remedy it. Otherwise, if we are scattered and one side falters, allowing a Heavenly King to break through or kill you, the entire battle will collapse!"

"If Marquis Zhennan also takes action... I'm worried he might disregard everything and rush to save the Hundred Battle King! But if they are concentrated, and he acts, once he leaves..."

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Then you all might die. Will he choose to fight alongside you or go to rescue the Hundred Battle King?"

The group exchanged glances, and Shadow Marquis whispered, "After all, we've been comrades for many years..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Are you that confident?"

No one responded.

Su Yu smiled and continued, "Also, don't be too pessimistic. There's no need! Since I'm letting you take action, it's naturally not to send you to your deaths!"

Su Yu exhaled and said, "They are being held back by the Hundred Battle King, for one. Even if they weren't, I can weaken their strength! If the Hundred Battle King restrains them, causing their power to drop to the level of top-tier Daofuse, which I refer to as second-tier Daofuse, then if I weaken them again, they might fall to third-tier Daofuse. Of course, I've never tested this; it's just an estimate... An estimate with significant risks!"

"We haven't truly engaged them, so their exact strength will need to be assessed in detail!"

Hearing this, the group was surprised. General Yingwu quickly asked, "Do you mean you can suppress the Heavenly Kings to a level comparable to mine?"

If so... this battle wouldn't just be less risky; it might even achieve an astonishing victory!

If they could truly encircle and kill six Heavenly Kings, even if Su Yu and Lantian couldn't kill the remaining two, it wouldn't matter. Killing six Heavenly Kings would be enough to shake the entire Upper Realm, even instilling fear!

Su Yu said solemnly, "It's just an estimate! It's not guaranteed! So, I want you to still consider them as Heavenly Kings and be prepared for the worst! Don't think there won't be any problems!"

But General Yingwu couldn't care less about that now. Excitedly, he said, "If we can truly suppress them to my level, then we would actually have a huge advantage! Huoyun and Zhou Tiansheng could handle two each!"

Could it be done? If possible... it's unimaginable!

The others were also excited. Could it really be done? Although it seemed unbelievable, since Su Yu said so, unless he wanted to die, there might really be hope.

At this moment, several ancient powerhouses were very excited.

"Let's see how our luck holds!"

Su Yu said lightly, continuing, "This is the general plan. Additionally, there's the escape and retreat plan!"

Su Yu marked several red dots.

"These are the beings close to the power of laws... It's best to stay away from them. Even if I detect the presence of Destiny Marquis and March, it's best to avoid them and not expose our identities!"

"The other Daofuse cultivators are scattered around..."

Su Yu drew a line with a red marker, "When retreating, I'll lead you out, but everything has its exceptions. If I can't escape or can't lead you out, follow this route. This route has the least risk of encountering danger!"

If possible, Su Yu would take them through the River of Time to retreat, but if not, he would have to leave on his own.

The group quickly memorized the route, not daring to be careless. This was the Source of the Dao! If they got the route wrong and encountered top-tier powerhouses from the Myriad Races, they would surely die.

Su Yu then looked at the Great Ming King, "You won't participate in the battle. Your task is to set up a barrier formation, and it must be stable!"

The Great Ming King began to breathe heavily, "With so many powerhouses participating, the formation required would be too strong. I can't set up such a powerful formation! Last time, when dealing with Marquis Jinlong, the formation I set up was broken by him! This time, with so many Heavenly King-level powerhouses, I think the formation will shatter instantly if they attack it!"

Su Yu was overestimating him!

Su Yu nodded, "So, Great Ming King, your strength is still lacking."

The Great Ming King smiled bitterly, "Yes, but I follow the path of formations, which is different from others. Progress isn't that fast."

Su Yu then looked at Grandstar and said after a pause, "Your strength has weakened significantly. At this time, dealing with Heavenly Kings, ordinary Daofuse cultivators are too weak!"

"I have some unowned power of laws here, and also some incomplete dao rules..."

Su Yu had taken quite a few treasures from the Human Emperor's Dao, which were quite helpful for Daofuse cultivators. However, there were also drawbacks.

Su Yu said solemnly, "These things can help you enhance your strength, but they are very unstable! Later, you might need to spend more time and resources to refine your dao power!"

Su Yu held some dao rules in his hand, and the group sensed them, all gasping. This guy had only been inside for a day, yet it felt like he had been in there for thousands of years. Not only had he gathered a lot of intelligence, but he had also collected a pile of treasures.

Shadow Marquis and the others had also lived in the Source of the Dao before, so they naturally knew what Su Yu had taken. Shadow Marquis was surprised, "These... many are fragments of dao rules, and they can even create Daofuse realms. Usually, it takes decades to produce a single broken dao rule... Human Lord... seems to have quite a few?"

Su Yu said calmly, "There are quite a few, but it's best to completely shatter them and use them as supplements for your own dao! Don't truly cultivate them as daos! Even if they are complete, don't."

He manifested several small dragons in his hand and threw them to the Great Ming King, "Don't treat them as daos to refine. Just comprehend them a bit, then shatter them and integrate them into your own dao power!"

The Great Ming King grabbed the dao power, and the small dragons struggled violently. He almost lost his grip, but after a while, he managed to suppress them, excitedly saying, "I seem to have comprehended some of the dao essence of formations."

Su Yu nodded, "The convergence of myriad daos naturally includes the path of formations. However... the daos here are incomplete. I call them pseudo-daos. Don't cultivate them. Currently, the truly complete daos of the Myriad Realms are only in the lower realm! The River of Time in the lower realm is the most perfect set of world rules!"

"There are still five days until the agreement with the Iron Devourer Race!"

"So, everyone has time. Prepare within these five days!"

"Absorb and digest. Five days should be enough. Enhance as much as you can. If you can't... then we'll see!"

Su Yu spoke for a while and then said, "Our goal is to kill those six Heavenly Kings. First, we will encircle one... Once we encircle one, the others will definitely come to the rescue. I won't suppress their power of laws at the start, so during the convergence, it will be the most dangerous!"

"Once they converge, I will promptly suppress them... They might experience a rule riot, and at that moment, it's the best opportunity to kill them!"

"If we can kill one or two Heavenly Kings at that moment, the rest will be easier to kill!"

Everyone noted this down and nodded.

Su Yu continued, "Also, the battle duration must not be too long!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Once it drags on, there are too many strong beings in the Source of the Dao. Even if we shield ourselves, it will be easy to be discovered! This time, it must be faster than when we dealt with the Dragon Race!"

Everyone grimaced. Marquis Dingjun, who had participated in the Dragon City battle, grimaced and said, "Faster? When we dealt with the Dragon Race, it took us less than a cup of tea's time. Now it has to be even faster?"

This battle... Su Yu was determined to carry out a blitzkrieg to the end!

"Of course, it has to be faster!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "From the start, everyone must go all out! No, not just all out. From the start, everyone must burn their blood essence, with a limit of burning five drops. Start by risking your lives! How can you win big with small stakes if you don't risk your life? Also, to avoid dragging it out and losing your lives! Everyone must burn their essence. After we kill them and retreat, we'll find a way to recover!"

Everyone smiled bitterly. Truly ruthless!

Starting by burning blood essence and unleashing big moves... These weren't just big moves; this was a true life-and-death combat method!

"Can you do it?"

Su Yu looked at them and said seriously, "If you're reluctant to burn your blood essence or get injured... then speak up!"

"We can!"

Marquis Huoyun immediately said, "If we can really kill a few Heavenly Kings, not to mention burning blood essence, even burning our lives wouldn't be a problem! If we die in battle and can exchange our lives for the fall of several quasi-kings, then it's all worth it!"

"That's the right mindset!"

Su Yu looked at them and said after a pause, "This is also the first large-scale cooperation between me and you, including with the ancient forces! You are assessing me, and likewise, I am assessing you!"

"In the lower realm, I've participated in countless wars, led many, and have always been invincible! I don't want my first failure to be at your hands!"

At this moment, Su Yu was no longer aloof or reserved. He spoke earnestly, "I've initiated several wars in the Lower Realm. The first large-scale war annihilated multiple Daofuse Realm experts, including the Dragon Emperor, Spirit Emperor, and Golden-winged Roc Emperor. The second major war erupted in the Death Realm, where we seized the East King Domain, South King Domain, and West King Domain, and expelled the North King. The third large-scale war saw the deaths of the Nether Emperor, the Three-headed Demon Wolf, Marquis Falling Star, and Marquis Devil Dance. The fourth war brought down the Phoenix Emperor, Ape Emperor, and Heavenly Dragon Marquis."

"If we count the Upper Realm, the battle against the Dragon Race was the fifth large-scale war!"

Su Yu looked at them, enunciating each word, "Five times, we have slain over thirty Daofuse Realm experts from the myriad races, including those from the Death Realm! And on our side... zero Daofuse Realm casualties!"

The ancient marquises were internally shaken!

Su Yu continued coldly, "It's not that I look down on you, but your performance in the Ninth Tide battle makes me uneasy! The strength I've accumulated was built on successive victories, not something I had from the start! You know the situation in the Lower Realm. Hundred Battle King isn't dead; he blocked the later Daofuse Realm experts! Before that, the entire Human Race had only one Daofuse Realm expert, the Great Zhou King!"

"With only one Daofuse Realm expert in the entire Human Race, I gradually accumulated the strength I have today. I don't want it... to be squandered by you!"

At this moment, Marquis Huoyun couldn't believe it, "No Daofuse Realm casualties... really?"

Not a single one?

Impossible!

Su Yu replied coldly, "Do you think I need to deceive you? So, if this counts as the sixth time, I hope it will also be a complete victory! Because we are currently in the shadows. If we suffer losses in a direct confrontation, I can accept it. But if we suffer significant losses in a surprise attack, where the enemy doesn't know our strength, identity, or background... then how can we fight a direct battle?"

Repeated battles have always caught the enemy off guard.

Until now, Su Yu's true strength had not been exposed.

General Yingwu inhaled deeply, looking at Su Yu with some shock, "So, Blue Sky, this quasi-king, actually advanced not long ago? He wasn't a quasi-king at the start of the tide?"

Blue Sky chuckled, "Yes, I only advanced before coming up here. Before that... I was still in the Sunmoon Realm!"

The group was once again shocked. Really?

The Great Zhou King spoke softly, "Blue Sky was indeed in the Sunmoon Realm before. His path to Daofuse was unimaginably difficult! It was Emperor Yu who burned ten thousand years of his lifespan to help him succeed and advance to the Heavenly King domain."

"This... no wonder you seemed like you were dying!"

General Yingwu was incredibly surprised, looking at Su Yu with disbelief, "Are you insane? You... you actually burned ten thousand years of your lifespan for someone else's path?"

Crazy!

No wonder Blue Sky obeyed Su Yu's every word.

Previously, Su Yu wasn't even a quasi-king.

A quasi-king obeying a top-tier Daofuse expert without question was puzzling to everyone before.

To become a quasi-king in this tide, one must have unimaginable talent.

Yet, Blue Sky followed Su Yu without complaint.

Now they understood.

A warrior dies for a confidant!

If a ruler treats me as a national hero, I will repay him as one!

In life, meeting such a ruler, if it were me, I would also repay with my life!

General Yingwu's eyes were complex, "If someone burned ten thousand years of their lifespan for me... not to mention ten thousand, even one thousand, I would... I would repay with my life..."

Su Yu's face darkened, unwilling to respond.

What did that mean?

Why look at me!

I don't need it, nor do I have the lifespan to burn for you.

At this moment, everyone felt incredibly complex.

Now, they finally understood why people from the Lower Realm followed this young Emperor Yu so obediently.

To turn the tide and win multiple battles, killing dozens of Daofuse experts without losing a single one, such a ruler, if it were me, I would also be willing to follow!

For a moment, everyone fell into deep thought.

Su Yu seemed much stronger than Hundred Battle King.

As for strength... when Su Yu stepped into the quasi-king domain, everyone's previous thoughts faded. He was too strong, with immense talent and rapid progress, stepping into the quasi-king domain in such a short time. Was reaching Hundred Battle King's level really that far off?

Everyone understood that if Su Yu didn't die, reaching the level of a rule master wasn't out of the question. Reaching Hundred Battle King's level should be no problem.

Even now, General Yingwu couldn't help but say, "I think, even if Hundred Battle King comes out, he can't compete with you! Why not unseal him and let him fight the myriad races... he has no hope of competing with you."

Previously, they thought Su Yu couldn't compete with Hundred Battle King. Now, thinking about it, could Hundred Battle King compete with Su Yu?

So what if he's stronger!

Once Su Yu gains some support, like from March and others, Hundred Battle King can't do anything to him and would still be besieged by the myriad races unless he joins them.

"Let him be!"

Su Yu said calmly, "It's up to his luck! If he's lucky, he can escape. If not... I won't go out of my way to save him! Of course, the slogan is still to rescue Hundred Battle King!"

The group smiled bitterly, alright, now they knew, the slogan was just a slogan, don't take it seriously.

"Enough talk, everyone knows the plan."

Su Yu exhaled, "I'll go see Marquis Zhennan, see the situation. If he agrees, then it's you nine. If he agrees, we can have two more!"

Everyone nodded slightly. Two more would be best. If not, according to Su Yu's plan, there was still a great chance of success.

At this moment, even Marquis Huoyun couldn't help but change his attitude, saying, "If he doesn't agree, then don't release him, lest he disrupts our plan!"

"......"

Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu glanced at him, ha, men!

Previously, he was reluctant, but now... hehe, he changed his face quickly, even suggesting Su Yu not release him to avoid disrupting the plan, clearly thinking Marquis Zhennan might ruin the grand plan.

Shadow Marquis also chimed in, "Marquis Zhennan is straightforward. If he doesn't agree, he'll likely refuse directly! As for Wen Qi, forget it. He's Marquis Zhennan's advisor. Keep him sealed, lest he gives Marquis Zhennan bad ideas! Sometimes, some ideas aren't Marquis Zhennan's thoughts, but Wen Qi's suggestions!"

Shadow Marquis added, "Keep Wen Qi sealed. When the Human Lord meets Marquis Zhennan, it's best not to give him a chance to speak! Just suppress him directly!"

"......"

They were all giving Su Yu advice!

Before this, they hadn't spoken like this.

Su Yu was speechless. These guys... changed faces quickly.

Not bothering to say more, Su Yu's Mark of Civilization appeared, and he vanished instantly.

...

Inside the Mark of Civilization.

Marquis Zhennan's vision blurred, and a figure appeared.

Before he could speak, Su Yu slapped down, suppressing Wen Qi beside him!

Since Shadow Marquis suggested it, Su Yu thought it best to suppress Wen Qi directly.

After all, they didn't lack a new Daofuse expert!

But Marquis Zhennan was quite strong.

Marquis Zhennan's face changed, a bit angry, "What are you doing! Humiliating us? Even if you're the Human Lord of the Lower Realm, I am an ancient marquis..."

Boom!

Su Yu punched, forcing Marquis Zhennan back dozens of steps, blood spilling from his mouth.

Su Yu repelled him without wasting words, directly saying, "I want to rescue Hundred Battle King. Are you willing to help?"

Marquis Zhennan was still angry, but hearing this, he paused, suspicion in his eyes, "What did you say?"

"I said I want to rescue Hundred Battle King!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Eight Heavenly Kings sealed Hundred Battle King. I don't have enough strength now. I only ask you, will you help?"

Marquis Zhennan frowned, "Of course! But... is it suicide? Although I want to rescue Hundred Battle King, eight Heavenly Kings... Heavenly Kings... quasi-king domain, right?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. Heavenly Kings and quasi-kings were the same, just different names, which these people could understand.

Su Yu didn't bother to correct him, directly saying, "Now, all the ancient marquises have agreed to help, except you..."

Marquis Zhennan was angry, "Did you suppress everyone?"

"No, only you!"

Marquis Zhennan grew angrier, "Then why? Even if you're the Human Lord, I haven't betrayed the Human Race. Why treat me like this?"

He didn't understand!

He thought others were also suppressed, but it was just him?

Su Yu said calmly, "Because you're not a good person! The Iron Devourer Race, despite their defeat in the Ninth Tide, still secretly helped the Human Race. The Upper Realm Human Race still has a few ancient marquises alive, thanks to the Iron Devourer Race's efforts! To save Hundred Battle King, you actually wanted to harm the Iron Devourer Race! To me, you're worse than a traitor!"

Su Yu's eyes flashed coldly, "Today, you can betray allies. Tomorrow, for Hundred Battle King, you'll betray many humans, betray your comrades! In your eyes, one Hundred Battle King is worth more than ten or a hundred Daofuse experts. If Hundred Battle King could be unsealed, and six ancient Daofuse experts fell, would you think it's worth it?"

Marquis Zhennan was stunned, then gritted his teeth, nodding, "Worth it!"

He didn't deny it because he believed it was worth it!

Su Yu said coldly, "I guessed as much! Shadow Marquis and others say you're unruly, say you're straightforward. I can guess your thoughts! In your eyes, you're not betraying the Human Race, but making it better. So, for the strong, sacrificing the weak is acceptable, right?"

"Right!"

Marquis Zhennan's expression changed, becoming heavy, "I know not everyone agrees, but I think... it's worth it!"

Su Yu's voice turned icy, "Then let me ask you, to rescue Hundred Battle King, are you willing to die?"

"If I can rescue him, I am willing!"

Marquis Zhennan gritted his teeth and said, "Back then, it was me and the others from the Soldier's Cave who pushed Hundred Battle to the throne. In his final battle, Hundred Battle was defeated... Soldier's Cave covered the retreat and died, Minshan was killed, and Hundred Battle was sealed... Only I have survived until now! If Hundred Battle can be freed, one Hundred Battle is worth more than a hundred of me! So to save him, I am willing to pay any price to make up for the losses we caused back then!"

"You can't make up for it!"

"I know!"

Marquis Zhennan roared, "I know I can't make up for all of this, but only if Hundred Battle is freed can the Human Race be saved! He is the strongest quasi-king! Without him, how can we resist the myriad races?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Alright, since you put it that way, I won't waste words! I need you to exert your strength. The moment you come out, burn all your blood essence, self-destruct your body, and kill the enemy in front of you!"

Marquis Zhennan looked at him coldly.

Su Yu taunted, "You don't want to?"

Marquis Zhennan replied with a cold face, "It's not that I don't want to, I just don't trust you. If what appears in front of me is my friend, my comrade, my fellow soldier..."

Su Yu took out the Human Lord Seal and calmly said to it, "I guarantee that what you face will be the Heavenly Kings who sealed Hundred Battle. If I'm lying, the Human Lord Seal will shatter!"

As he spoke, the Human Lord Seal trembled slightly.

Marquis Zhennan's expression changed slightly.

Su Yu looked at him, "Is that enough? If not, I can have Shadow and the others come to assure you."

Su Yu said lightly, "If you find it credible, then when I release you, you have only one purpose: to kill the enemy! Self-destruct your body, kill as many as you can, but you can keep your sea of will intact!"

"Can Hundred Battle be saved?"

Marquis Zhennan looked at him, and Su Yu shook his head, "Not certain! Eight Heavenly Kings sealed him. We do our best and leave the rest to fate. If I could guarantee his rescue, that would be nonsense!"

Marquis Zhennan sighed, "What are the chances?"

"Fifty-fifty."

Su Yu smiled faintly, "If there was no chance at all, I wouldn't take the risk! It depends on Hundred Battle himself!"

Marquis Zhennan fell into contemplation. After a while, he said, "Even if I self-destruct my body, or even completely self-destruct, I may not be able to kill a quasi-king..."

"I will find a way to suppress their power, suppress it to the extreme, and cause their Great Dao to riot."

"Then... alright!"

Marquis Zhennan gritted his teeth, "I can agree to you! But I need a guarantee!"

"Speak!"

Marquis Zhennan gritted his teeth, "If Hundred Battle King is truly unsealed, you must not betray him!"

"......"

Su Yu was taken aback.

Marquis Zhennan gritted his teeth, "You managed to subdue everyone in such a short time. I know the temperament of Huoyun and the others; they are not ones to easily submit! You came and directly suppressed me, obviously because I am a supporter of Hundred Battle! You are the current Human Lord, Hundred Battle was the previous Human Lord... You unseal him, not necessarily to save him, maybe you want to kill him, to make room for the lower realm's strong to give birth to Daofuse!"

"You are very capable, very resourceful. I don't know how, but I can guess you must be extremely resourceful... Hundred Battle is impulsive by nature, having been sealed for many years, he may not be your match!"

Su Yu was surprised, then laughed.

This was the first person who, without waiting for him to say anything, believed that Hundred Battle was not his match, and he was still a staunch supporter of Hundred Battle.

Marquis Zhennan said solemnly, "If you really want to deal with Hundred Battle... then it must be in front of everyone, defeat him... or even kill him! This is my only request, my only guarantee! In the battle between two kings, there are wins and losses, I can accept both!"

He feared that Hundred Battle, knowing nothing, understanding nothing, would be killed by this mysterious new Human Lord!

The king of the Human Race doesn't necessarily have to be Hundred Battle.

However, he hoped to see a dignified change of regime!

Su Yu laughed, after a while, he chuckled lightly, "If he doesn't actively seek trouble with me, I don't mind agreeing to you! If he does seek trouble with me... everything will be as I say! What you say doesn't count!"

"If he actively seeks death, then he's foolish, and I won't say much more!"

Marquis Zhennan looked at Su Yu again, "In this way, can the Human Lord be satisfied?"

"Fair enough!"

Su Yu laughed, "It seems you're not that foolish!"

Saying this, he glanced at Wen Qi over there, "This guy won't be unsealed, to avoid unnecessary chatter! Let's leave it at that. Of course, to prevent you from coming out and attacking me, I will set up some measures on your Great Dao... Can you accept that?"

"I can!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "I thought you were a fool, but it seems you're just stubborn! Well, survive first, and if you die, there's no need to mention anything further."

"Hope I get the chance!"

Marquis Zhennan replied in a deep voice.

Su Yu smiled and drifted away.

Marquis Zhennan's reaction... was much more decisive than he had expected.

This guy, Huoyun Marquis and the others said he was impulsive, violent, rebellious...

Perhaps he was, but this guy was not lacking in wisdom.

He hadn't even interacted much with Su Yu, didn't know Su Yu's name, yet he dared to assert that Hundred Battle, playing tricks, was likely not Su Yu's match.

Indeed, after all, Shadow Marquis and the others submitted too quickly.

Without some skills, these people who had experienced the era of Hundred Battle wouldn't easily pledge allegiance to any Human Lord.

"Hope he doesn't do anything foolish!"

Su Yu walked out of the Mark of Civilization, muttering to himself, hoping that when he comes out, he doesn't turn against me... I wasn't joking about setting up measures on the Great Dao!

At this moment, Su Yu and his group began to wait silently.

A great battle was about to begin!
