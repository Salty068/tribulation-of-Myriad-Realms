Chapter 687: Annihilation (Please Subscribe)

The fall of three ancient marquises sent shockwaves through the heavens and earth. The Daofuse cultivators from various races fled in panic!

Beside Su Yu, June and the Hou Pseudo Emperor were both exhilarated, experiencing for the first time the thrill of a one-sided battle. It was unbelievable! Especially on the human side, with the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King displaying formidable combat prowess, they felt both excited and a bit fearful. Su Yu, this guy, seemed to have an endless supply of trump cards!

Who would have thought that both the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King had advanced to the Daofuse Realm without making a sound?

At this moment, Su Yu's blood was boiling. After slaying three ancient marquises, he scanned the surroundings. Everywhere, people were fleeing. Yet, there was one fool flying towards the Human Realm. Upon closer inspection, it was none other than the Nether Emperor. Su Yu quickly understood. If they didn't retreat, they would block his path back. If Su Yu retreated, the Nether Emperor could find a way to bypass them.

"He's doomed. Pretend he doesn't exist!" Su Yu glanced in that direction but didn't linger. If he didn't die, it would defy the natural order.

Wan Tiansheng didn't need to say anything. There were still seven Daofuse cultivators hidden in the Human Realm, all acting as guardians. Of course, if Wan Tiansheng couldn't handle it, they probably wouldn't intervene. Su Yu's orders were clear: do not act unless absolutely necessary.

Turning his gaze to the God Emperor Jiwu, Su Yu was particularly wary of the God Race. They were silent! Both the Immortal and Demon races had lost Daofuse cultivators, yet the God Race had only one God Emperor in the Daofuse Realm, and he was still alive. Not to mention, the God Race had suffered few Eternal Realm casualties!

In the distance, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, along with three Daofuse cultivators, was also fleeing rapidly. As for the Phoenix Emperor and the Ape Emperor, Su Yu wasn't in a hurry. They were destined to die sooner or later. Killing them now would only serve as a deterrent, which might lead Tiangu to fight desperately. However, Su Yu did want to eliminate the God Emperor. Silent types were often the most dangerous.

There were also a few newcomers who had joined the battle. Su Yu hadn't paid much attention to them before, but if he could kill them, it would be ideal. These races dared to participate, showing they had some nerve.

He glanced back and quickly turned around. "Great Zhou King, teleport everyone to intercept the Heavenly Dragon Marquis and his group!"

"Understood!" The Great Zhou King responded with a low shout, equally invigorated. Killing the Meteorite Marquis alone was challenging, but today was truly exhilarating. All he had to do was unleash the power of the Great Dao, and with a few powerful allies, the killing was effortless!

Divine characters appeared, and a spatial passage opened. The Space God Emperor was also adept at teleportation. With the two working together, the teleportation of several Daofuse cultivators was faster and more precise.

The Great Zhou King quickly asked, "Who must be killed?"

"The three newcomers. The Heavenly Dragon Marquis can wait. The newcomers aren't part of my plan!" Su Yu wanted to eliminate those outside his plan!

The Great Zhou King quickly understood and was about to activate the teleportation array when he glanced at Su Yu and hurriedly said, "Emperor Yu, you..."

"I'm going to the Nether Realm!" Su Yu replied solemnly.

"Hmm?" The Great Zhou King was taken aback. Su Yu continued, "Three Daofuse cultivators have died, and more might follow. I need to check the situation. We can't be careless. If the Nether Emperor isn't helping us but is instead aiding the Upper Realm in opening a passage, that would be troublesome!"

"That's too dangerous!" The Great Zhou King protested. Su Yu going alone was not acceptable. He quickly said, "I'll go with you. I..."

Su Yu coldly interrupted, "Follow orders! Quickly teleport over and stop them!"

After speaking, he glanced at the distant Jiwu, who was fleeing towards the God Realm. Su Yu furrowed his brows and then shouted, "God Devourer, Hongmeng, abandon the Immortals and Demons and intercept Jiwu! Force out the old relics of the God Realm! I don't believe the God Realm only has one Daofuse cultivator!"

"Wow, wow, wow, I want to eat Tiangu..." Doubao shouted, unwilling to leave. He wanted to eat Tiangu! He had already eaten one of his fingers, and it was delicious. He didn't want to go!

Su Yu shouted, "Kill Jiwu first. Tiangu still has trump cards; he's not easy to kill!"

In front of everyone, Su Yu shouted, his voice resonating through the heavens. Tiangu's expression changed slightly. Although Doubao and Bing were reluctant, they quickly flew towards the God Realm. In the distance, Old Turtle was also decisive. Even though he was suppressing three Daofuse cultivators, he immediately followed orders and headed towards the God Realm!

Tiangu and Demon Halberd didn't stop them. They were actually stunned and a bit apprehensive. Everyone was so obedient! Orders were followed without question! As soon as Su Yu spoke, the entire battlefield, including all the Daofuse cultivators in the Human Alliance, obeyed without exception. They didn't care about the safety of their own realm or the Human Realm. They didn't care if their current opponents were being suppressed. Old Turtle, who was suppressing three of them and even had a chance to kill the Ape Emperor, abandoned them and headed straight for the God Realm. Who dared to stop him?

Near the God Realm, Jiwu's face was extremely grim as he fled towards the God Realm. The River of Time was turbulent, and he was no longer calm. Three powerful figures were coming to kill him. He shouted angrily, "Tiangu, stop them for a moment!"

Are you just going to watch me get blocked outside the God Realm?

At this moment, their side wasn't weak, but their morale had collapsed. A group of scattered soldiers! The Heavenly Dragon Marquis, along with three Daofuse cultivators, had become headless flies, terrified and unwilling to continue fighting. They weren't a single race, and unlike Su Yu, who constantly intimidated and suppressed the alliance, Tiangu and his group were purely an alliance of interests. Tiangu could generally take charge, but he couldn't suppress the other Daofuse cultivators. Winning a favorable battle was fine, but as soon as the battle turned against them, Su Yu had long said that such an alliance would inevitably collapse!

Without a top-tier existence to unite everyone, no matter how many people there were or how strong their combat power was, a slight mistake would lead to total defeat! Clearly, Tiangu and his group were feeling this now.

Seeing the God Emperor about to be intercepted, Tiangu hesitated. If the God Emperor was killed, then this time, the myriad races of the Lower Realm would truly collapse. But... the God Emperor... Jiwu... His eyes flickered. Jiwu was too low-key, and the God Realm was too low-key. No one from the Upper Realm had come down, and there were no old relics in this realm. Compared to the Devil Realm, the God Realm was much weaker. Among the three major races—God, Demon, and Immortal—their strength was comparable. His Immortal Race had already lost two Daofuse cultivators, and the Demon Race had lost one. Yet, the God Race hadn't even lost a single Eternal Ninth Stage cultivator.

With these thoughts, Tiangu shouted, "Heavenly Dragon Marquis, enter the Dragon Realm. Don't run around! Don't return to this realm; just take refuge in the Dragon Realm!"

In the distance, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis was about to respond when he saw the Golden Crow soar into the sky and disappear, leaving a message: "No, staying in the Dragon Realm, we are merely Eternals. Returning to our realm is the only way to become Daofuse! If the humans invade the Dragon Realm, how can the Heavenly Dragon Marquis alone withstand them?"

Rather than hiding in another realm, it's safer to return to their own realm! At least in their own realm, their combat power is stronger. Even if surrounded, there's a chance to turn the tables. The enemy wouldn't dare to invade recklessly, fearing a counterattack. Going to the Dragon Realm? Tiangu had a good idea, but didn't consider what would happen to their race if they left. That would be completely abandoning their race!

At that moment, the void fluctuated, and in an instant, eight powerful figures appeared, weapons drawn. "Endure!" "Silence!" The Great Zhou King shouted, and the character for "silence" erupted, while the Great Dao of Endurance also exploded. The Golden Crow, who had just left, roared furiously, flames scorching the sky! Endure? He was indeed affected, but he knew this was a life-and-death moment. He directly burned his Great Dao intensely, driving away the influence. He couldn't endure! Enduring meant death!

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis and the other two, seeing the Golden Crow blocked, had no intention of rescuing him. In an instant, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis dove into the Dragon Realm below! The Kunpeng also quickly submerged into the Sea of Stars, while the three-headed demon wolf frantically flew towards its own realm. They had only one wish: that the Golden Crow wouldn't die too quickly. If he died too quickly, those people would pursue the others. However, with eight powerful figures joining forces, how could he not die quickly?

In the void, nine Great Daos collided! The Golden Crow Half-Emperor showed a look of despair and helplessness, suddenly feeling lost. With a bitter smile, he said, "Foolishly dormant for countless years, and now I rush to my death!" Truly helpless. Seeing the three marquises in the Nether Realm, he thought it was an opportunity, a chance to show loyalty. He had indeed been dormant for countless years, and now... he rushed to his death, gaining no benefits. How could he not feel bitter?

"Golden Crow Race, seal the realm!" The Golden Crow Half-Emperor roared, "With the life of an Eternal, seal the realm! Do not emerge unless the Upper Realm opens!" Boom! A thunderous explosion echoed, and the eight powerful figures retreated, the Great Dao shattering, blood pouring like rain.

The Great Xia King spat, "Old Zhou, why didn't your turtle's Endurance Dao work?" He actually let someone self-destruct! The Great Zhou King's face was pale. "Try using it continuously, and teleporting multiple times. Let's see how much strength you have left?" Do you really think I'm made of iron? The power of the Great Dao is also being consumed! After consecutively killing several Daofuse cultivators, how much strength is left to control these desperate Daofuse cultivators who know they're doomed?

"Forget it, you're useless. Just focus on teleporting!" The Great Xia King shouted, quickly saying, "Hurry, the Kunpeng is about to return to its realm!" The Great Zhou King glanced over. "It's too late. Go kill the three-headed demon wolf!" The Kunpeng was already at the realm gate, and teleportation wouldn't make it in time. Intercepting the three-headed demon wolf still had a chance!

He and the Space Beast Emperor quickly teleported, leading people to pursue the three-headed demon wolf. Meanwhile, the three-headed demon wolf was frantically howling, accelerating, tearing through the void, stepping into the River of Time, disregarding everything, burning blood essence! With only one thought: return! Otherwise, certain death! The Kunpeng had returned to its realm, and so had the Heavenly Dragon Marquis. Humans would find it difficult to invade their realm, but outside, they were doomed! Today, four Daofuse cultivators had already died. He didn't want to be the fifth! Yes, he didn't want to.

...

The three-headed demon wolf didn't want to die, and neither did the Nether Emperor. At this moment, the Nether Emperor was too close to the Human Realm. He actually didn't want to go to the Human Realm anymore, but he saw the battlefield filled with relentless fighting, with human experts pouring out. In his current situation, did he really have hope of returning to the Nether Realm? The Great Zhou King was a teleportation master; could he return?

At this moment, he saw some people: Qin Zhen, Xia Longwu, Wan Tiansheng, Nan Wujian, Yun Chen... The Nether Emperor's heart stirred. Don't kill, capture them! Exchange them for a chance at survival!

These were some of Su Yu's friends and mentors, descendants of the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King. Capturing them might just be his ticket back!

Yes, capture them!

That was the thought that flashed through his mind. If he could capture even one, his chances of survival would greatly increase. Among a group of Eternals, he was confident that with some sacrifice, he could capture one.

He swiftly flew towards the Eastern Rift Valley!

At the Eastern Rift Valley, Wan Tiansheng stood proudly atop the peak of the Eastern Rift Mountain, his white robes fluttering in the wind. Seeing the situation, he sighed.

"I didn't want to intervene!"

According to Su Yu's plan, they should remain hidden if possible. If they couldn't, then Wan Tiansheng would make his move! They were to avoid exposing the existence of the guardians unless absolutely necessary!

But why was the Nether Emperor heading towards the Human Realm at this time? He could have taken a detour; Su Yu and the others might not have had the time to deal with him.

The Nether Emperor was getting closer!

In no time, he crossed the Desire Sea Plain, heading straight for the Eastern Rift Mountain. Behind Wan Tiansheng, dozens of Eternals shouted, "To battle, kill him!"

With so many Eternals, they weren't afraid of the Nether Emperor! Though some might die, they could take down the Nether Emperor.

"Guard the realm!"

Wan Tiansheng's voice was calm. Su Yu wanted no casualties, no unnecessary sacrifices. He would rather forgo the chance to kill a lower realm Daofuse cultivator than send people to their deaths. Otherwise, with so few Daofuse cultivators in the myriad realms, Su Yu would have already broken through the realms and killed them all.

But doing so would inevitably result in casualties.

"Time is with me!"

With a light laugh, he decided to test his strength. His finger traced the sky, and a River of Time surged towards the Nether Emperor!

The Nether Emperor's aura exploded as he tried to suppress the river, but Wan Tiansheng had already appeared beside him in an instant.

"Replicate!"

In a flash, countless Wan Tianshengs appeared. Each one wielded a River of Time.

On the Human side, many looked towards Lantian, who giggled and cheered, "Go, Tiansheng, kill him!"

A group of Eternals quickly distanced themselves from Lantian.

What path was Wan Tiansheng on?

What path?

Wan Tiansheng soon showed them. He knew all paths!

The Human Path encompassed all, self-created, with each moment of life being an insight, a great path, all-encompassing!

He was compassionate, and the heavens wept.

The Nether Emperor suddenly felt an overwhelming sadness, tears falling as he clashed with Wan Tiansheng. In the next moment, the Nether Emperor's fury erupted, and Wan Tiansheng glared back, "Traitor, you deserve death!"

The Nether Emperor felt a sudden panic, as if he truly was a traitor!

"You... are you Daofuse?"

"No, you're not Daofuse!"

The Nether Emperor was shocked. Wan Tiansheng was an opener of paths!

"Do you know your crime?"

A thunderous voice pierced the heavens, and the Nether Emperor roared, clawing at Wan Tiansheng. "I confess to your ancestors!"

"Take a journey through the River of Time to cleanse your sins!"

With a low shout, the River of Time opened, and he and the Nether Emperor fought further and further away, as if leaving this time and space.

Wan Tiansheng led him into the River of Time, battling fiercely amidst countless waves!

The battle was intense, and the Nether Emperor was inwardly terrified.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that the Humans were not defenseless, not truly relying on those Eternals to fortify the Human Realm, but because Wan Tiansheng was there!

In the River of Time, outsiders could no longer see their presence!

The two fought further and further, as if reaching the end of the River of Time.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng glanced around, satisfied that no one was watching.

In the next moment, with a low shout, a Wan Tiansheng emerged from his body, demonic energy surging.

"I am the Demon, exterminating all!"

Another Wan Tiansheng appeared, holy light shining, with a compassionate expression, "I am the Saint, enlightening all beings!"

Yet another Wan Tiansheng appeared, filled with bitterness, "I am Suffering, all beings suffer!"

One by one, Wan Tianshengs appeared, and at this moment, Wan Tiansheng truly resembled Lantian, or perhaps... Lantian resembled him!

The Nether Emperor's face changed dramatically!

Each Wan Tiansheng was powerful, seemingly no weaker than the original.

And Wan Tiansheng's true self wore an indifferent expression, "All beings have joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, love, hate, resentment, and desire... The Human Path is all-encompassing, with countless great paths, emotions controlling human nature..."

He spoke of things the Nether Emperor did not understand. In the next moment, countless Wan Tianshengs, immensely powerful, charged at him!

The Nether Emperor seemed mad, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing hysterically.

Sometimes bitter, sometimes furious, sometimes weeping in repentance...

As if he had gone mad!

Indeed, he had gone mad, with countless emotions constantly assaulting him, leaving the Nether Emperor somewhat broken.

A myriad of demons!

A myriad of madmen!

What kind of path was he on?

Wan Tiansheng glanced around again, making sure no one was watching him. He didn't want to test his great path anymore, fearing being seen and labeled a monster.

I'm not!

My path is not for others to see; what Su Yu saw was just the surface.

Somewhat sinister!

The wooden Nether Emperor continued to attack, and Wan Tiansheng struck with a sword, severing the great path. With a boom, the Nether Emperor's aura plummeted, and in the next moment, a sword pierced through his head!

His sea of will extinguished!

Wan Tiansheng collected the corpse and quickly vanished from the River of Time, leaving. No one knew how he had killed him, right?

The less they knew, the better!

...

Boom!

Because Wan Tiansheng was moving against the current, time passed slowly, as if only a moment had passed.

Suddenly, blood clouds gathered in the sky, and a torrential blood rain poured down.

The various powerful factions engaged in battle all turned to look at the Human Realm, only to see Wan Tiansheng gracefully emerging from the River of Time, smiling as he descended from the void towards the Eastern Rift Mountain!

Seeing the gazes from all directions, he cupped his hands slightly and laughed loudly, "Wan Tiansheng, Director of the Purification Department of the Emperor Yu's Mansion, pleased to meet you! The Nether Emperor has been executed, and the first task of the Purification Department is successfully completed!"

"......"

Silence fell over all sides.

Even the Humans were utterly shocked.

Wan Tiansheng!

Single-handedly killing the Nether Emperor!

This...

Below, Lantian laughed brightly, "Tiansheng truly lives up to my expectations, the best in the world!"

Wan Tiansheng ignored him, smiling as he looked around, "It seems you all won't be coming to the Human Realm!"

In the Immortal Realm, Tiangu and the Symbol King both wore extremely grave expressions.

Single-handedly killing the Nether Emperor!

The speed was astonishing.

Wan Tiansheng!

From today onwards, Wan Tiansheng would have a place in the myriad realms!

Today, the fifth Daofuse was killed!

Simultaneously, with a thunderous boom, between heaven and earth, an enormous three-headed demon wolf had its three heads severed. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King each took one, while the Iron Devourer Beast Emperor smashed the other with a bamboo stick.

All three heads fell simultaneously!

The newly joined three-headed demon wolf was slain!

Today, the sixth Daofuse was killed!

Further away, in the Divine Realm, a roar echoed as Jiwu, disheveled, shouted in fury. In the next moment, a gigantic hand appeared in the sky above the Divine Realm, grabbing Jiwu. Though its arm was shattered by Old Turtle's mountain strike, it forcibly dragged Jiwu back to the Divine Realm.

Tiangu and his group looked over again.

They saw the Divine Realm quickly sealing off, with a formidable presence emerging between heaven and earth. Surprisingly, the formidable presence was a female, ancient beyond imagination, not the Daofuse from the previous tide, but an incredibly ancient existence.

The old woman looked at Old Turtle, gasping, "The young are impudent, Brother Hongmeng... forgive them! This old body... should still be able to fight one more battle, so please, Brother, retreat!"

Old Turtle looked at the old woman for a long time, his mouth opening and closing, "You... are still alive... incredible..."

"Clinging to life, unable to leave this realm... Brother, forgive me."

The old woman seemed to struggle even to speak, while Hongmeng frowned, eventually saying, "Retreat!"

Beside him, Doubao angrily shouted, "Charge in, why fear her?"

Hongmeng sighed, didn't Doubao recognize her?

"The Divine Emperor's consort!"

"Jiwu's wife?"

"The Ancient Divine Emperor!"

Upon hearing this, Doubao instantly reached out, grabbing Chui Bing and running away.

Terrified!

The Ancient Divine Emperor's consort!

Still alive?

And Old Turtle, too, looked at her for a long time, sighing, "So that's it, relying on the Divine Emperor's great path to sustain life, no wonder she doesn't want to make a move! Take care of yourself, Jiwu may not die today, but he will eventually!"

Old Turtle chose to retreat.

She might not be able to come out, but perhaps she could, for one final battle, likely leading to her death.

Because she would lose the great path sustaining her life!

However, if it were a battle to the death, this old woman would be immensely powerful.

The Old Turtle said nothing as the trump card of the Divine Realm was revealed. Jiwu had almost been killed by them, and the Divine Realm truly had no other Daofuse experts left. There was no need for more, as long as they held their ground. This old woman, at least, possessed the combat power of a Heavenly King, possibly even stronger than the Old Turtle.

No wonder no one from the Upper Realm of the Divine Realm had descended. If they did, they might have to share the power of laws with the old woman.

The Old Turtle quickly retreated and soon regrouped with the other powerful beings. Over at the Great Zhou King's side, there were eight, and with the Old Turtle and two from the God Devourer Race, there were eleven Daofuse combatants swiftly gathering outside the Fate Realm.

In the Human Realm, Wan Tiansheng sat alone at East Rift Mountain, smiling as he surveyed the surroundings. In less than ten minutes of battle, six Daofuse experts had been killed!

At this point, only fourteen powerful beings remained in the Myriad Realms who were not confirmed to be part of the Human Alliance: Tiangu, the Rune King, Demon Halberd, Demon Leap, Jiwu, the Divine Empress, Heavenly Dragon Marquis, Phoenix Emperor, Ape Emperor, Kunpeng, the Ancient Giant King, Heavenly Overseer Marquis, Duobao, and the Fate Emperor.

As for the Fate Emperor's side, it was still uncertain, and the same went for the Ancient Giant King.

In one swift battle, six Daofuse experts were obliterated!

In the Human Realm, counting Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng, there were thirteen Daofuse combatants at this moment. In truth, there were far more!

At this moment, the myriad realms fell silent.

A crushing defeat!

Su Yu had been planning for many days. After the last battle, he had killed five Daofuse experts. Today, he killed six more, slaying eleven Daofuse experts from the myriad races!

In the Immortal Realm, Tiangu looked despondently towards the Fate Realm. The passage to the Upper Realm... now, using the power of laws to draw down Upper Realm experts might be sending them to their deaths, as they would face suppression, and Su Yu and his allies would kill them!

So, even if he wanted to pay a great price to loosen the passage's power, he had to think twice. If the Upper Realm wasn't prepared and rashly sent down four or five Daofuse experts, they would just be throwing fuel on the fire!

The Human Race had taken the strategic stronghold of the Fate Realm, causing Tiangu and his ilk to hesitate. Unless they could ensure the passage was fully opened and all Daofuse experts from the Upper Realm could descend, sending just a few would be sending them to their deaths!

"Don't let anyone come down!"

Tiangu thought to himself, hoping the fools in the Upper Realm wouldn't make a mistake. Even if many Daofuse experts had died and the passage's power might have loosened, they shouldn't descend!

Su Yu had entered the Fate Realm!

Wuming... most likely had sided with the Human Race.

With two Daofuse experts stationed there, if the Great Zhou King also entered, three Daofuse experts would be stationed there. Without several Heavenly King-level experts descending, they wouldn't be able to suppress them!

"Losing the Fate Realm and six Daofuse experts!"

Tiangu had never felt more despondent than at this moment.

It's over!

The Lower Realm could no longer stir up any storms!

From now on, the history of the Lower Realm would be completely rewritten, with the Human Race achieving a great victory!

Even though there were still many Daofuse experts remaining, they were all terrified!

Without the Upper Realm opening, who would dare to venture out and fight again?

As he pondered, a sudden rumble erupted from the Phoenix Realm in the distance. Without a word, the Phoenix Emperor sealed the realm passage at a great cost.

She wasn't the first!

The next moment, the Dragon Realm, Ape Realm, and Kunpeng Realm followed suit, all sealing their realm passages with loud booms, resolutely deciding not to open their realms or engage in battle without the Upper Realm opening!

The Great Zhou King and others were taken aback.

They weren't as despondent as Tiangu but rather... perplexed.

Sealing the realms!

This... this was courting death!

If Su Yu pinpointed the location of their small realms corresponding to the Death Realm, they would be cutting off their own escape routes!

Such a sealing of realms, even if Daofuse experts attacked, would take time to break.

The Great Zhou King's eyes were filled with a strange light.

There was nothing to say. At this moment, sealing the realms might be the best tactic, but sealing the realms meant Su Yu would likely laugh himself to death.

He was just worried they would run away!

Now, not only could they not escape, but with the realms sealed, even if battles broke out, the outside world might not know for a while.

"The mandate of heaven is with Su Yu!"

The Great Zhou King sighed inwardly. Truly, the mandate of heaven was with Su Yu.

He hadn't expected such an outcome.

Taking the Fate Realm forced the various races to seal their realms, slaying six Daofuse experts.

In just ten minutes, this achievement surpassed countless years of accumulation and sacrifice by the Human Race.

The Great Zhou King sighed, and the others were also filled with emotion.

One by one, the powerful beings floated in the air, their auras erupting, covering the myriad realms!

Countless small realms trembled and shivered.

The Human Race had won!

Although they hadn't yet killed the main experts of the three major races, the God, Demon, and Immortal races in the Lower Realm could no longer contend with the Human Race!

Barely able to protect themselves!

The Human Race had also taken the Fate Realm, guarding the passage to the Upper Realm. Unless the Upper Realm opened, they could no longer fight!

...

At the same time.

In the Fate Realm.

At the peak of Destiny Mountain, Su Yu looked into the void, while not far away, the Fate Emperor watched him.

He thought Su Yu was too bold.

"Emperor Yu... aren't you afraid I..."

Su Yu looked at him calmly and said, "Afraid of what? Or does the Fate Emperor think that with me alone here, you can take me down?"

Su Yu smiled, "Some people like to forget. Even things that happened not long ago, they like to forget!"

The Fate Emperor frowned slightly, "Emperor Yu misunderstands. I just think you trust the Fate Race too much..."

"No, I don't trust you. I don't trust a stranger!"

Su Yu didn't hide it, smiling, "I only trust myself! If you make a move, today, there will be no more Fate Race in the Lower Realm, believe it?"

The Fate Emperor was extremely solemn. After a long time, he nodded, "I believe! The Death Realm... has undergone drastic changes, and the Fate Race can also open a death passage!"

"I like smart people!"

Su Yu laughed, "Since I'm here, if you make a move, today I will annihilate your Fate Race!"

The Fate Emperor sighed and said no more.

Su Yu... truly had nothing to say, extremely cautious. He came here not because he gambled on the Fate Race's submission, but because he was sure that even if the entire Fate Race came out, he could handle them!

Su Yu no longer paid attention to him and instantly transformed into the appearance of Dao King, his aura waning, his face full of grief, and in an instant, his aura changed dramatically!

The next moment, above, the gate to the Upper Realm shook violently!

A grand voice came, an angry voice, "Is anyone there? What happened!"

Su Yu quickly shouted, "The Lower Realm is in turmoil. The Human Race ambushed Marquis Falling Star, Marquis Demon Turmoil, Marquis Abyss... Hongmeng joined forces with the Great Zhou King and the God Devourer Race experts to kill three supreme beings! May I ask if the ancestor of our Immortal Race is on the other side?"

The passage shook violently!

Vaguely, an incomparably powerful existence appeared on the other side of the passage, filled with rage, "What about the Fate Race?"

The Fate Emperor's eyes flickered, and he said calmly, "The Fate Race doesn't care about these matters. Immortal Battle Marquis, this is between you and the Human Race."

"Ridiculous!"

The ancient being roared angrily, "How dare you, Fate Race... do you think that just because Destiny Marquis is alive, you can act recklessly?"

The Fate Emperor said helplessly, "I didn't participate in the battle. No matter how fierce the fighting outside, it has nothing to do with the Fate Race. Why should Immortal Battle Marquis take it out on me?"

After saying that, he added, "Many Daofuse experts have been killed in the Lower Realm. Immortal Battle Marquis, it's best not to descend at this moment! Lest you be surrounded and killed by the Human Race!"

"Human Race?"

Above, Immortal Battle Marquis said coldly, "How could the Human Race have the ability to kill me? Hongmeng... such audacity!"

At this moment, filled with boundless rage, he quickly shouted, "Who are you?"

"The junior of the Immortal Race, Dao Heng, in charge of Dao King Domain, responsible for garrisoning the Fate Realm... Sir, the Fate Race... the Fate Race does not allow our Daofuse experts to garrison, possibly secretly aiding the Human Race. Sir, I suspect they betrayed our Marquis Falling Star's intelligence..."

"Ridiculous!"

The Fate Emperor roared angrily, "How dare you slander, believe it or not, I will kill you?"

"You have some nerve!"

In the void, a large face appeared, lightning flashing, Immortal Battle Marquis filled with boundless anger, manifested his face across the void, and shouted angrily, "Try killing him!"

The large face scolded, quickly looking at Su Yu, and said in a deep voice, "Can you descend at this moment?"

Su Yu quickly said, "No! Sir, outside the Fate Realm, there are several Human Race experts. Lord Tiangu and the others have already withdrawn from the Allheaven Battlefield, returning to their realms. It's not the time to fight..."

Immortal Battle Marquis sighed, "I had already guessed. Tiangu, that useless... at this moment, I can barely descend, but... there's no need! You continue to garrison here. If Wuming dies, your Fate Race... we'll see! Don't think that just because the Human Race has a slight advantage in the Lower Realm, they can overturn the heavens!"

Saying this, the power of thunder grew stronger, and Immortal Battle Marquis, across a realm, looked at Su Yu again, and said in a deep voice, "Tell Tiangu to lie low! Find a way to continue weakening the realm gate's power of laws. Don't be foolish and send Daofuse experts to their deaths repeatedly! Ridiculous, how many Daofuse experts have died? The Lower Realm had such a good foundation, and you turned it into this mess, useless, a bunch of useless!"

He was extremely angry, all useless.

The situation in the Lower Realm was too good!

The ninth tide had ended. If not for the battlefield's blockade, the Human Race would have been completely wiped out, with almost no strong experts left, yet it turned into this mess!

He couldn't understand!

Furious!

Su Yu quickly nodded, but said pessimistically, "Sir, the Human Race produced a Su Yu, who inherited the pen dao of the Culture King! And because of this, the Iron Devourer Race and others have all sided with him. He inherited the Culture King's legacy, his fortune is like a rainbow! It's not that we can't defeat the Human Race, but this Su Yu, his fortune is too strong, our race can't suppress it. Please, sir, grant us a method to suppress it!"

"Culture King's legacy?"

Immortal Battle Marquis hesitated for a moment, then stopped shouting, and transmitted to Su Yu, "The Culture King's fortune is indeed strong. His heir... that fortune is not something Tiangu can compare to! Only the Ancient Council can suppress it! Tell Tiangu, the best way now is to collect councilor tokens! I have six councilor tokens here, pass them to Tiangu. No matter what, quickly collect over fifty to rapidly suppress the power of laws here!"

"Don't leave this place. I will continue to collect councilor tokens. I can't descend, but I can take advantage of the loosening power of laws to send some councilor tokens down. Councilor tokens are powerful and won't be destroyed..."

Su Yu hurriedly transmitted his voice, "No, my lord, the attitude of the Fate Clan is unclear. If you send the Councilor Token now and it gets intercepted by the Fate Emperor, then..."

The Immortal Battle Marquis chuckled, "Dao Heng, you're quite something! I actually know your name... but never mind, you were young during the last tide, so let's not bring it up! The Fate Clan wouldn't dare intercept it... but just in case, I'll place the Councilor Token inside my Battle Dragon Staff. I'll teach you how to activate it. Others won't know the method, and if they try to seize it, they'll only bring disgrace upon themselves. Once I descend to the lower realm, I'll retrieve it!"

"My lord, how can I take your weapon, that..."

"No worries, the troubles in the Upper Realm are nearly settled!"

The next moment, a stream of willpower surged into Su Yu's mind, containing the control method for the Battle Dragon Staff.

Quickly, the Immortal Battle Marquis said, "We can't delay any longer. Tell Tiangu to remember, stop fighting. It's a waste of troops and strength. Gather 50 Councilor Tokens as soon as possible!"

With that, a thunderous boom echoed as a massive, formidable staff shot down from the portal in the sky, resisting countless bolts of lightning.

Golden patterns flashed across it!

It shattered the lightning with immense power, and though it dimmed slightly under the onslaught, it broke through the punitive force, crashing down from the heavens.

"The punitive force of the rules has returned... I must leave now. Dao Heng, take good care of my weapon!"

"Understood!"

"Wuming, I don't want anything to happen to him!"

With a cold snort, the large face shattered, and the void calmed down.

Su Yu reached out his hand, and the powerful Battle Dragon Staff landed in his grasp.

The Fate Emperor opened his mouth!

Damn!

He was tricked just like that?

Is this even possible?

Good heavens!

The Immortal Battle Marquis even sent his weapon down. What... what is this?

He stared blankly at Su Yu, who seemed unfazed, casually saying, "What do those in the Upper Realm know? They're all a bunch of idiots! Their information is so limited. Apart from reports from the lower realm, what else do they know? Who's dead, who's alive, that's about it! The Fate Clan remains neutral, who would believe I'm impersonating the Immortal Clan in front of the Fate Emperor? Why would the Fate Emperor even look at me like that? But I do appreciate the Fate Emperor's cooperation!"

Su Yu chuckled. Six tokens!

Councilor Tokens, not bad.

Counting them, he actually had quite a few. He'd have to consolidate them later and see how many he really had. Quite a number, anyway.

The Immortal Battle Marquis had quite a few, and he dared to give them!

Su Yu had merely set a casual trap to see if there was anything powerful in the Upper Realm that could suppress him, and in return... he received Councilor Tokens and the Immortal Battle Marquis's weapon.

After a while, the Fate Emperor said bitterly, "I... I have no other choice. The Immortal Battle Marquis is extremely powerful, ranking among the top five in the Immortal Clan in the Upper Realm. Now he's even thrown away his weapon..."

Su Yu laughed, "Not just that, there are also six Councilor Tokens. Perhaps even more important than the weapon!"

The Fate Emperor's expression changed completely!

No way out now, he had to fully side with the Human Clan, or else the Immortal Clan would kill him, definitely. Even if the Destiny Marquis came, it wouldn't help.

Six Councilor Tokens!

He felt like cursing!

Are you an idiot?

Whatever Su Yu says, you believe?

Damn!

You actually gave away all the Councilor Tokens, and six at that, are you crazy?

If the Immortal Battle Marquis knew they ended up in Su Yu's hands, he'd kill Su Yu first, and then him, Wuming, because with him there, the Immortal Battle Marquis didn't suspect anything.

Who would impersonate the Immortal Clan in front of the Fate Emperor?

Moreover, the Fate Emperor had been neutral for countless years!

At this moment, the Fate Emperor was utterly speechless, while Su Yu smiled and said, "It's not a big deal. The Fate Emperor actually had no other path. I want to control this place unless... the Fate Emperor wants to fight me!"

The Fate Emperor remained silent for a long time, then sighed, saying nothing more.

Forget it, the choice was made, no regrets!
