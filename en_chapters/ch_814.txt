Chapter 814: Playing Around (Please Subscribe)

A thunderous roar reverberated.

Su Yu integrated all the pages into his own world. Of course, being a good person, he left something behind for the Time Sage.

"A cookbook!"

Yes, Su Yu left the book cover for the Time Sage. As a good person, he wouldn't devour everything completely. If he ever met the Time Sage again and she asked, "Where's my cookbook?" Su Yu would naturally hand over the "cookbook."

"Time Sage... Food Sage?"

Su Yu suddenly paused. The title "Time Sage" sounded grand and was something Su Yu had heard from Xingyue. But back then, the Time Sage wasn't considered very powerful, right? Would she really call herself the Time Sage? Could it be "Food Sage"? Devouring everything clean!

For a moment, Su Yu was bewildered. Was it Time Sage or Food Sage? If it was the latter... it would fit the name of the cookbook perfectly!

Confused as he was, Su Yu decided not to dwell on it. Whatever the name, it didn't matter now. If he ever met the Time Sage, he could ask her then.

Moments later, Su Yu waved his hand, and the barrier near the Heaven Monitoring Marquis disappeared.

Su Yu's Human Lord Seal and his world seemed unchanged, just like before. Su Yu himself felt the same, without much change.

After opening the heavens, Su Yu had the strength to contend with the Chaos Dragon. Up to now, it seemed he had always maintained this level of strength, at least in the eyes of outsiders.

Su Yu was indeed strong! But his strength was limited, not reaching the level of a ruler of laws. At most, he could contend with a fifth-tier ancient physical Human King, which was the general perception. Of course, insiders had learned from Su Yu that he had the potential to fight against weaker rulers of laws like the Divine Empress.

Even so, it was already quite astonishing.

At this moment, the aura of the Heaven Monitoring Marquis was also fluctuating. He had completely reached the level of a Heavenly Venerable! Moreover, he wasn't considered weak among the Heavenly Venerables.

The Dao of Fortune was indeed formidable. If it wanted you to be unlucky, you would be unlucky! Against those of the same rank, the Dao of Fortune was even more mysterious. Ordinary people couldn't withstand it, especially those with weakened fortune, like the Sin Clan. If the Heaven Monitoring Marquis faced them, it would be even more advantageous.

At this time, the Heaven Monitoring Marquis opened his eyes and looked at Su Yu with a complex expression.

Su Yu had grown even stronger!

Others couldn't see much, not even the Fate Clan, who could only see the surface. But to the Heaven Monitoring Marquis, what he saw was a dragon of fortune!

Su Yu's fortune was truly like a rainbow!

In the eyes of outsiders, the Heaven Monitoring Marquis saw Su Yu as a massive, restrained dragon, immense yet not revealing a trace.

This was Su Yu!

This generation's Human Lord, possibly the last Human Lord of ancient times, and perhaps the new emperor of a new era!

"Not bad!"

Su Yu smiled, "You seem to be taking advantage of me!"

"......"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis remained silent.

Su Yu said lightly, "Those who take advantage of me usually don't end well!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis didn't respond.

I am the fortune of ancient times. If you don't want me to take advantage of you, then completely sever ties with the ancient era. Otherwise, kill me. What else can you do?

I am passive, not active.

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "What do you think about killing you now to let some people advance to the level of rulers of laws?"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis looked at him, remained silent for a while, and then spoke, "I think you won't kill me now."

"So confident?"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis said solemnly, "Killing me now might not benefit you much. Instead, it could make others stronger! Even if you kill me, you'll wait until others gain less benefit than you before you act!"

"True!"

Su Yu nodded with a smile, "You're not too dumb, but not too smart either. If you were really smart, you wouldn't have opposed me."

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis remained silent, not speaking.

Opposing Su Yu... was merely out of some unwillingness. When Su Yu inherited the pen dao, he wanted to seize his paper dao, so naturally, he was unwilling.

But now, he had come to understand everything.

The paper dao was something he could never master. Not only him, but even the Culture King hadn't mastered it. He had held the Hunting Heaven List for many years but couldn't master it because it required creating a new path, not following an existing one!

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis remained silent, and Su Yu didn't mind. He chuckled, "You represent the fortune of ancient times, while I control my own fortune. Do you think the fortune of the Hundred Battle faction lies with Hundred Battle or with Zhou Ji?"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis was silent for a while before speaking, "Perhaps not with Hundred Battle. The last time I saw him, his luck... didn't seem too good! During the Ninth Tide, he was invincible until the end when he got unlucky."

Su Yu was slightly taken aback and nodded, "Seems so! So, after his son was born, he might have stripped the fortune belonging to the Human Clan and integrated it into his son? So his son is considered the child of destiny?"

Speaking of this, Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Destiny... the name Destiny Marquis is quite grand. Anyone can be his son!"

This cold joke didn't interest the Heaven Monitoring Marquis.

However, he still responded, "The name Destiny Marquis is indeed grand, which is why he can live until now, representing that the fortune of the Fate Clan is actually quite prosperous!"

Su Yu looked at strength, while the Heaven Monitoring Marquis primarily looked at fortune.

Su Yu chuckled, glanced at him again, and said, "Stay here. I'll go out for a while. Don't think about running. If you don't run, I might not kill you. If you run, I'll definitely kill you. If I kill you, even Hundred Battle might kill you!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis closed his eyes and said no more.

He wouldn't believe Su Yu's words.

This person was extremely shameless.

Despite his young age, he was cunning and deceitful!

And Su Yu quickly vanished into thin air.

...

Su Yu still had things to do.

Taking advantage of the three-month period he had set, he needed to deal with some outsiders and eliminate some unfavorable factors.

For instance, the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon.

These two were definitely hiding in the chaos.

And they wouldn't be hiding too deep.

If he could find them in the chaos, it would be best to kill them, or simply find Zhou Ji and eliminate him. Zhou Ji might carry the fortune of the Hundred Battle faction. Killing Zhou Ji might cause the Hundred Battle faction to be extremely unlucky, to the point where they could choke on water!

If Hundred Battle wanted to delay, Su Yu would delay him.

Three months was the limit!

Before that, Hundred Battle might take action, and Su Yu wouldn't sit idle.

Taking advantage of the myriad races not daring to act, and the Sin Clan possibly wanting to bring out strong individuals, Su Yu would also quell some disturbances.

...

Finding people in the chaos wasn't easy.

Especially old foxes like the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon. The Eight-Winged Tiger was particularly cunning and would guess that someone wanted to deal with them, so they would hide well.

However, for Su Yu, there were ways to find people.

At this moment, a white furball appeared above Su Yu's head.

Ever since Su Yu had put it away last time, the furball had been sleeping soundly in the Heaven Gate. When it woke up, it would lick the Heaven Gate's shadow a few times. Now, it didn't even lick the character anymore, as there was nothing to lick. Su Yu had integrated the character into his world.

The furball sniffed, opened its eyes, and saw a void. Curious, it asked, "Smells nice. Where are we?"

"Chaos!"

"Oh!"

Why call me out?

The furball looked around, finding it not fun at all—dark and dreary, not as good as sleeping.

Su Yu smiled, "Time to work, back to your old job! Sniff around and see if you can find the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger!"

With that, Su Yu laughed, "I've roughly sensed your dao now. You're extremely sensitive to energy fluctuations and rule fluctuations. You're a fake devourer dao, more like a detection and tracking dao."

The furball looked at him strangely, jumping on his head, "Didn't I tell you? I knew that a long time ago! When I was with the Big Fat Dog, being forced to read every day, I knew!"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless. Really?

I hadn't noticed.

The furball had indeed reached the Eternal level, but Su Yu had seen it before. It seemed like it had been forcibly elevated. So, this little guy actually knew?

The furball continued, "I knew back then. I'm good at tracking... mainly because I can smell a lot of nice scents! Then the Book Spirit said it might be a detection-type dao."

Su Yu chuckled, "You're not stupid!"

"Of course!"

The furball was delighted. You're the stupid one.

Su Yu laughed, "Alright, as long as you know. Sniff out the soy sauce scent."

"Huh?"

"The Eight-Winged Tiger ate a lot of soy sauce. Don't sniff him directly or track him; it's easy to get discovered. Find the soy sauce scent, and I might be able to find him!"

Su Yu laughed.

Yes, loving soy sauce might not be a good thing.

The furball was too weak. Tracking the Eight-Winged Tiger would easily get discovered.

But if the furball just sniffed the soy sauce scent, it had nothing to do with the Eight-Winged Tiger himself. This way, it would be easier.

The furball sniffed with its little nose and nodded, "Okay! Smells nice. When do you think I can be as powerful as Fat Ball?"

It still had some expectations.

Unfortunately, it was still very weak. Even licking the Heaven Gate all day, it was still at the Eternal level, not even at the Daofuse level.

As Su Yu grew stronger, the gap between them widened.

Su Yu chuckled, "What's the rush! I don't lack a Heavenly Venerable or two right now. Being too strong might not be a good thing. If you're too strong, everyone will know about you. You're better off now. In the early days, people noticed you, but now no one remembers you!"

Su Yu laughed, "Keep it up, and in some time, you'll be completely forgotten!"

"When everyone forgets you... I'll have a backup plan for myself."

Su Yu laughed, "My father, my teacher, they're both very weak. I haven't really elevated them. Just let it be! When I find a place to build my own lair, you'll help me guard it... Learn from Fat Ball. Even after the Culture King and the others disappeared for over a hundred thousand years, it still watered the flowers every day..."

The furball said dejectedly, "But I just like sleeping, not watering flowers every day."

Too tiring!

Su Yu was speechless, "I'm not asking you to water flowers, just to guard the house, understand?"

"Ah!"

"Back then, no one remembered you. If something happens to me one day, and you can help keep the house in order, maybe after countless years, when I return, I'll have a place to stay!"

Su Yu spoke softly, "First it's the Human Emperor, then the ruler of the Myriad Realms, then the Human Ancestor, and the Lord of Time... This era is too complicated!"

Su Yu murmured, "Why was this era sealed? Who sealed it? Where did the Gate come from? Who forged it? Why is everyone obsessed with returning to the Myriad Realms?"

"Is the Myriad Realms really that great?"

"Or is it that without the Myriad Realms, these guys would die?"

This is the core issue now!

Why must they return to the Myriad Realms?

What exactly lies beyond the Gate?

If it's also chaos, then just open another day. If that doesn't work, just live in the chaos. Those Chaos Ancient Beasts, you know, they prefer chaos over the Myriad Realms.

Why insist on coming back?

That's the strange part!

The Myriad Realms, in the entire chaos, should just be a piece of heaven and earth. If you have the ability, find a place to open the heavens yourself; there's no need to come to the Myriad Realms!

This series of secrets left Su Yu unable to investigate clearly.

Because, indeed, it was a bit far from him.

Currently, he was still far from that level.

With Maoqiu, Su Yu talked a bit more. Ever since entering the academy, Su Yu had taken Maoqiu everywhere: to the Great Ming Prefecture, to the Allheaven Battlefield, to the ancient city, to the Luminous Domain Mansion, to the Death Realm...

From nurturing to now, Maoqiu had always been by his side. However, this guy now had no divine characters to lick, losing some of its fun.

Just a companion!

No need to be too strong, just like Fat Ball and the Culture King, they were actually quite weak, but they didn't need Fat Ball to be strong.

Most of the people around Su Yu weren't particularly strong.

Su Yu didn't even let them merge with the Dao, not wanting them to integrate into his world. It was meaningless; if he died, the great Dao within his world would collapse.

Maoqiu listened quietly, not interrupting. If Su Yu couldn't figure these things out, naturally, it couldn't either.

It only remembered that Su Yu said he would build a home someday and wanted it to guard the house.

Maoqiu remembered this and suddenly said, "Fragrant one, when you build a home, can you create a big divine character, fragrant and sweet, one that I can lick forever?"

Su Yu was taken aback, then laughed, "Are you planning to guard the house while licking the divine character?"

"Is that not allowed?"

"Of course, it is!"

Su Yu laughed, "That's a small matter!"

Maoqiu's eyes squinted with joy!

That's good, very good, even happier than Fat Ball, who had no divine character to lick.

At this moment, it had no other pursuits, starting to sniff around, a faint power of laws emanating, very weak, but this power of laws was also very special, specialized in tracking.

Maoqiu had used this method early on to help Su Yu track down many people, getting through several crises.

Soon, it sniffed, "A little to the left, seems like there's a scent, not too clear..."

Following its direction, Su Yu quickly moved forward.

...

At the same time.

In the chaos, within a floating broken mountain.

At the base of the mountain, two small beasts were lurking.

The Eight-Winged Tiger suddenly looked around, not sensing anything, feeling a bit uneasy, and quickly said, "Broken Tail, let's move, time to go!"

"Move again?"

The Chaos Dragon grumbled, "We've moved several times already!"

"Stop talking nonsense, the Myriad Realms are getting more dangerous, chaos isn't safe either. That Martial Emperor has entered, and Su Yu might come too, along with Hundred Battle and his son... In short, be cautious!"

Chaos wasn't as safe as before.

Previously, the depths of chaos were forbidden for some.

But now, with the Martial Emperor stepping in, it's no longer safe.

The Chaos Dragon was speechless, "Who are we guarding against?"

"They're fighting life and death in the Myriad Realms, would they care about us?"

Was the Eight-Winged Tiger being too cautious?

We've survived countless years in chaos; would anyone bother us now?

This time, it was really unlucky!

Not only did they not get the chaos will from Yu Qing, but they were also dragged around by the Eight-Winged Tiger, making the Chaos Dragon a bit impatient.

"Guarding against whom?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger thought for a moment and said, "Guard against everyone! The situation in the Myriad Realms is more complicated and difficult than we imagined, with more strong individuals! I originally thought Yu Qing was the only difficult one... Eating Yu Qing would be enough! We had a chance, if not for Su Yu constantly causing trouble, there was still a chance!"

What a pity!

Now, the situation has completely changed.

The Chaos Dragon was extremely depressed, "But there's no need to be so afraid, right? Not to mention others, just Su Yu, if he really comes, alone, without bringing his world, we can eat him without a problem!"

Su Yu, the Broken Tail Dragon had fought him before. Last time, when Su Yu opened the heavens, he was much weaker. The Broken Tail was also due to Su Yu's self-destruction, and he had to break his tail to escape from the Heaven Gate.

Otherwise, Su Yu wasn't really his match.

After opening the heavens, Su Yu hadn't been around for long. Even if he progressed, he was probably about the same as him.

Plus the Eight-Winged Tiger, they couldn't kill Su Yu!

The Chaos Dragon said, "We can't just keep hiding, right?"

Since they came out, the goal was to advance, not to hide. That would be too boring. This time, their target was Yu Qing, to consume the chaos will on him, giving both of them a chance to advance.

And this doesn't conflict with Su Yu, right?

Nor does it conflict with Hundred Battle, it seems.

The Chaos Dragon felt the Eight-Winged Tiger had no reason to worry.

The Eight-Winged Tiger couldn't be bothered with him, "What do you know?"

We want to advance, but it also depends on whether others agree. If we become rulers of laws, would Su Yu and the others allow it?

Clearly impossible!

These days, it's tough.

The Eight-Winged Tiger sighed inwardly, forget it, this Chaos Dragon isn't smart enough, won't understand even if explained.

It's normal, just get used to it.

Every wise person has some fools around them!

Without fools, how can the wisdom of the wise be highlighted?

So the Eight-Winged Tiger was used to this, and this was recorded in the books of various races.

"Stop talking, let's move!"

"Alright!"

The Chaos Dragon, although stronger, the Eight-Winged Tiger was a bit smarter, so it decided to follow the Eight-Winged Tiger for now.

The two giant beasts shrank their bodies, carrying the broken giant mountain, continuing to move.

This mountain wasn't anything special, but it could conceal their forms.

After moving for a while, the Eight-Winged Tiger still felt unsafe and said, "Keep moving!"

"..."

The Chaos Dragon wanted to just kill him, they had moved far enough, why keep moving? Might as well move to a place beyond the Myriad Realms' reach.

"Let's go!"

"Can't move anymore!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger was speechless, "Go to hell!"

This stupid dragon!

Just like the dragons of the Myriad Realms, stupid. Heard the Myriad Realms' dragons were descendants of the Chaos Dragon lineage that went to the Myriad Realms, no wonder they're all idiots!

However, they had moved quite far now.

The Eight-Winged Tiger had to stop, taking out a cup of soy sauce, "Forget it, have some soy sauce tea and rest!"

Good stuff, giving you some to show my generosity.

The Chaos Dragon wasn't too interested, but didn't mind trying it, extending a claw. A dragon and a tiger cautiously drank a little, the Eight-Winged Tiger enjoying it, the Chaos Dragon indifferent, but seeing him like that, also showed enjoyment.

To avoid the Eight-Winged Tiger thinking it looked down on him.

While drinking, the Eight-Winged Tiger's face suddenly changed, its whiskers stood up!

Its tail straightened!

Its wings also stood up instantly!

And the Chaos Dragon's color changed, quickly relaxing, "Seems like it's Su Yu..."

The Eight-Winged Tiger, however, fled frantically!

Nonsense, I know.

But, it's Su Yu coming, that's unusual!

Dangerous!

"Seems like it's here..."

At this moment, a childish voice sounded, Su Yu's laughter echoed, "I know, I felt it!"

"Two seniors, why run when you see me?"

Su Yu's laughter resonated around them, the rippling waves stirring the chaos power, making the Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon feel uneasy, as if... it was dangerous!

"Why run when you see this weak cultivator?"

"Weren't we cooperating happily before?"

Su Yu's laughter echoed again!

And at this moment, both the Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon sensed something was wrong, Su Yu... seemed stronger.

Trouble!

The Eight-Winged Tiger continued to flee, wings flapping rapidly, even ignoring the Chaos Dragon. Su Yu coming here didn't seem like a good thing, a dangerous feeling.

Yet Su Yu was still unseen, his laughter continued, "Really, stop running, aren't you tired?"

At this moment, around the Eight-Winged Tiger, the chaos power suddenly dispersed.

The Eight-Winged Tiger's face changed again!

Su Yu had greater control over the chaos power.

"I say, in this chaos, there should be a sky!"

In an instant, the sky appeared, blue sky and white clouds!

Words became reality!

The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon's colors changed again, continuing to flee, but the surrounding void was changing.

"The four corners of the world, as far as the eye can see, all are my land!"

The earth spread!

In the chaos, heaven and earth were born!

The Eight-Winged Tiger couldn't hold back anymore, roaring, "Emperor Yu, humans have a saying, 'well water doesn't interfere with river water'... why force us?"

"When heaven and earth are born, there should be yin and yang..."

Yin and yang grew!

A surge of yin and yang energy emerged, forming a yin-yang cage, enveloping the surroundings. With a loud bang, the Eight-Winged Tiger crashed into the yin-yang barrier, trembling all over.

"When yin and yang appear, the five elements are born..."

Boom!

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth were born, flames burning the sky, the earth turning into giants, reaching for the Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon. A sharp sword was born between heaven and earth, shooting towards the two strong beings, countless giant trees turning into branches, binding them.

The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon were horrified!

Su Yu could actually construct heaven and earth here!

This was terrifying!

This was not Su Yu's world, more like a projection. Yet, it wasn't exactly a projection either. It was as if Su Yu was reconstructing the myriad paths here, swiftly organizing the chaotic power into a new world.

"The myriad paths of heaven and earth, nothing is unbreakable if it's fast enough... faster, just a bit faster..."

Su Yu's laughter carried a playful tone. In an instant, the two powerful beings felt as if the sun and moon were spinning, the heavens and earth overturning. Countless life forms appeared between heaven and earth—fire people, wood people, earth people...

These formidable entities charged at them in an instant!

"I say, there should be a Nine-Winged Tiger in this world!"

At that moment, a tiger with nine wings suddenly appeared, roaring as it charged at the Eight-Winged Tiger!

"I say, there should be a Twin-Tailed Dragon in this world!"

In the blink of an eye, a giant dragon with two forked tails appeared, charging at the Chaos Dragon!

The two powerful beings were dumbfounded.

The next moment, a great battle erupted. The Broken-Tailed Dragon swung its tail, and with a loud crash, shattered the Twin-Tailed Dragon into pieces, rejoicing, "They're all just for show!"

Scared me to death!

They looked formidable, but in reality, they weren't much of a fight!

"The Twin-Tailed Dragon isn't enough? Then let's have three tails, four tails..."

Su Yu counted as he spoke, and in the blink of an eye, thousands of giant dragons were born in the world. The last dragon was all tails, making anyone who saw it shiver!

The Broken-Tailed Dragon kept slaughtering those dragons, but the more it killed, the more appeared!

At this moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger roared, "Stop killing, get out of here! If you don't leave this world, you'll never finish killing them. He's the Creator, this place is his domain, run!"

If they didn't escape, Su Yu could create countless tigers and dragons. What was the point of fighting?

"I say, there aren't enough tigers, come out!"

In an instant, countless tigers appeared around the Eight-Winged Tiger.

Only then did Su Yu emerge from the void, with a faint smile, "Is it fun?"

"How about I find you two some companions, maybe a mate?"

The two powerful beings remained silent, frantically crashing against the surrounding barriers.

Su Yu shook his head, "Why bother? You're strong, but brute force won't work!"

Just as he finished speaking, the Eight-Winged Tiger suddenly spat out a sharp sword, piercing through the yin-yang barrier in an instant, and escaped!

Su Yu was momentarily stunned, then laughed, "Impressive! A tiger that can wield a flying sword, you're something!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger didn't look back, not caring about the Chaos Dragon!

The Chaos Dragon could help stall for a bit!

Su Yu was becoming more terrifying!

As he was thinking, Su Yu's laughter suddenly echoed in his ears, "You ran out, that's not fun, you know?"

Boom!

Before the Eight-Winged Tiger could react, a fist the size of a sandbag punched it, leaving it dizzy, its skin torn, and even a tooth knocked out...

With a loud bang, Su Yu kicked it, sending it crashing into the yin-yang barrier!

It collided with the Chaos Dragon, which was swinging its tail at the barrier. The Chaos Dragon's tail was already out, and it was too late to retract... well, it could, but retracting it would hurt itself, so it decided to just swing it!

With a loud crash, the Eight-Winged Tiger was once again torn and battered, letting out a miserable cry, "Damn!"

Chaos Dragon, I'll remember you!

You hit me!

"Emperor Yu, let's talk..."

It was terrified!

Su Yu was too strong, this was impossible, a single punch had injured it severely.

How could this be!

"No, play with me for a bit, I'm not easy to talk to. You run when you see me, that's looking down on me!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, and the next moment, he sealed the yin-yang barrier again. The world was shrouded, and Su Yu smiled brightly, "I say, the world has bad luck, fighting oneself..."

With a bang, the Chaos Dragon's tail once again struck the Eight-Winged Tiger's head. The Chaos Dragon looked innocent, "It wasn't on purpose!"

It just wanted to run!

But it ended up hitting the Eight-Winged Tiger again, there was really nothing it could do.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was furious, its flying sword shot out, ignoring the Chaos Dragon, just wanting to break the yin-yang barrier and escape!

With a swish!

The flying sword suddenly pierced the Chaos Dragon's tail, causing it to let out a miserable cry, cursing, "You're retaliating? I already said it wasn't on purpose!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger was also aggrieved, "It wasn't on purpose!"

"You're imitating me?"

The Chaos Dragon was furious, you are definitely retaliating!

"The path of emotions and desires, not bad, be angry, let the dragon and tiger fight!"

In an instant, both the dragon and the tiger became agitated and furious. The Eight-Winged Tiger was shocked, just about to shout, when Su Yu said again, "To endure what others cannot, that is a hero, don't shout!"

The path of silence erupted!

Anger boiled!

"Anger is meaningless, lust is a bone-scraping knife, you two, fall in love with each other!"

In an instant, the Eight-Winged Tiger looked at the Chaos Dragon as if it saw a peerless beauty, and the Chaos Dragon looked at it as if it saw a peerless beauty dragon!

At this moment, both the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon knew they had been tricked.

But... they couldn't resist!

Both the dragon and the tiger were extremely horrified, what should they do?

The next moment, the dragon and the tiger approached each other, drooling slightly, so beautiful!

"Are you two male or female?"

"Never mind, male or female, whatever!"

Su Yu asked and answered himself, laughing, "Do you two need it to be dark?"

Boom!

It went dark!

"The sky is the quilt, the earth is the bed, congratulations on entering the bridal chamber!"

"......"

"Ah!"

A roar instantly echoed, at this moment, the sky turned into a quilt, the earth into a bed, the dragon and the tiger naturally came together, but the Eight-Winged Tiger instantly sobered up, letting out a shrill scream, no!

I don't want this!

"Emperor Yu, spare me!"

It let out a shrill scream, spare me!

I don't want to sleep with the Chaos Dragon!

"Silence, noisy!"

Su Yu gave a low shout, coldly saying, "Enter the bridal chamber, I want to see the dragon and tiger match!"

"No!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger screamed, "Emperor Yu, spare me!"

"You must!"

"Emperor Yu, Emperor Su, Your Majesty, Master... Ancestor!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger watched as the foolish Chaos Dragon, truly lustful, was really coming towards it, a big thing standing up behind the dragon's tail, making it shiver, crazy!

The Chaos Dragon, this lunatic, this idiot, was really controlled!

Doomed!

Well, dragons are inherently lustful!

Damn your ancestors!

It screamed miserably, "No, Master, Ancestor, spare me!"

I don't want to be defiled by the Chaos Dragon!

No!

Only now did it understand that Su Yu had grown stronger, much stronger than before, the Chaos Dragon was so easily controlled, Su Yu was definitely much stronger than the Chaos Dragon.

Damn it!

Here, they couldn't possibly fight Su Yu!

"Calling me ancestor won't help!"

Su Yu said calmly, "You know what I want!"

"Your Majesty... spare me, we'll help you kill Control King... kill... kill anyone!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger shouted again, no, if this continues, the Chaos Dragon will really aim at my backside!

Heavens!

Su Yu's figure appeared, looking at it with a faint smile, "You said it yourself, if you don't listen, then what?"

"Let me die..."

"No, if you don't listen, I'll lock you and the Chaos Dragon together, performing a dragon-tiger fight for me every day!"

Su Yu said coldly, "Seal your physical body yourself, if you can escape, then my preparations were in vain!"

Damn you!

How long have you been preparing?

We've known each other for less than a month, and you've been preparing for a long time, how long is long for you?

The Eight-Winged Tiger cried miserably, "Your Majesty, control this guy first, otherwise I... I'm scared!"

The Chaos Dragon is crazy!

It wants to defile me!

Su Yu smiled, with a wave of his hand, the path dissipated, the path of lust disappeared.

The Chaos Dragon sobered up, suddenly seeing the Eight-Winged Tiger's backside facing it, it swung its tail, with a bang, sending the Eight-Winged Tiger flying.

Quickly, it realized something, looked at Su Yu again, with a hint of fear in its eyes!

Su Yu... was unimaginably powerful!

Impossible!

It still remembered the scene just now, of course, it wouldn't say, to avoid losing face!

Su Yu smiled faintly, "Broken-Tailed Dragon, was it fun? Want to try again?"

The Chaos Dragon's pupils contracted, it said in a deep voice, "Emperor Yu seems much stronger than before, could it be... the path has grown stronger in these few days?"

Too fast!

Before this, it still felt it could fight Su Yu.

But now, the gap was too large.

Su Yu himself hadn't even made a move.

The path's shroud wasn't omnipotent, someone as strong as the Martial Emperor could probably shatter Su Yu's projection's path power with a few punches!

But the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger, they weren't the Martial Emperor!

The gap between them was huge!

Su Yu's progress was simply terrifying!

Su Yu's smile was radiant, "Want to try again? I think you might want to, you seem very interested in the Eight-Winged Tiger..."

"No!"

The Chaos Dragon refused, subconsciously glancing at the Eight-Winged Tiger, shaking its big head, forget it, the Eight-Winged Tiger was too ugly!

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "How about this, I'll create an illusion for you, and you'll see the Eight-Winged Tiger as a peerless beauty dragon..."

In an instant, the Chaos Dragon's vision blurred, and when it looked at the Eight-Winged Tiger again, it was stunned!

It was a dragon with eight wings!

A peerless beauty dragon!

My heavens, so beautiful.

The Chaos Dragon even swallowed a bit, this could work!

"Wake up!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger suddenly roared, instantly breaking the illusion, and the Chaos Dragon, somewhat regretfully, looked at it with some dissatisfaction, I hadn't seen enough yet!

In this chaos, it hadn't encountered a similar kind for countless years!

This tiger, annoying!

The Eight-Winged Tiger was almost in despair, I don't want to be with this stupid dragon anymore, it had no restraint, too terrifying, the look in its eyes just now... it knew what kind of look that was!

Damn it!

Su Yu was too evil!

Su Yu's smile remained, "Want to keep playing? If not, seal yourself! I won't kill you, having you as a henchman isn't bad, how about it?"

"......"

The two powerful beings exchanged glances, both in despair.

Were they caught just like that?

Admit defeat or not?

After a moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger sighed, sealing its physical body, utterly dejected.

Since the first time I saw you, I knew, scholars aren't good people.

The White Robes, none of them are good!

I've run so far, yet I still can't escape your clutches!

From this day forth, I will never wear a white robe again!

The Eight-Winged Tiger was filled with sorrow. Those who wear white robes are all wicked, and I'm not wicked enough. I'm not as wicked as these white-robed ones!

When I become wicked enough, then I'll wear a white robe!

Seeing this, the Chaos Dragon could only follow suit and seal itself away, feeling helpless. Our emergence from the mountains was a miserable affair!

If I had known it would be like this, I might as well have stayed hidden in the chaos and slept!

P.S.: The next chapter will be delayed a bit; I'm going out for a meal.
