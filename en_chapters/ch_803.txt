Chapter 803: Overflowing Fortune

"Run for it!"

Su Yu noticed that Marquis Tongtian was still staring at the rear and couldn't help but shout, "What are you looking at? Do you really think you can swallow the Gate of Hell?"

Today was a great success!

As for the Brolong Beast wanting to come out... let it be. At this point, one more doesn't matter. We've already slaughtered a group of Celestial Sovereigns, and that's enough!

The key today was not only killing a group of powerful beings but also exposing the hidden depths of the Hundred Battle faction.

Yes, Hundred Battle didn't deal with Su Yu.

But... isn't it infuriating to have some hidden bastard lurking in the shadows while we're fighting for our lives?

"Your Majesty, aren't we going to kill that Yao Qing and Yue Zhan?"

"Kill my ass! They've already run off, how am I supposed to kill them?"

Su Yu cursed!

Then, seeing that Thunderstorm was also fleeing with Tiangu and the others, he roughly guessed their intentions and laughed. It seemed Thunderstorm was reluctant to give up on those Giant Race experts.

As for whether Tiangu and the others would deal with Thunderstorm, that was no longer Su Yu's concern.

Marquis Tianming also wanted to follow Su Yu, but Su Yu transmitted, "Don't follow me. Head to Ren Mountain, blend into the Myriad Races. Tiangu and the others won't dare to deal with you. Gather some intelligence for me and take Lantian's avatar with you!"

In his hand, Lantian's avatar flew over and landed on Marquis Tianming.

Marquis Tianming pondered for a moment, quickly nodded, and changed direction to catch up with Thunderstorm.

...

Thunderstorm saw Marquis Tianming approaching and his expression changed. He couldn't help but transmit, "You... you're going back to Ren Mountain?"

Your courage is extraordinary!

Marquis Tianming chuckled, "If you dare to go, why wouldn't I?"

Currently, the Myriad Races wouldn't rashly deal with Tianming, and the same applied to Thunderstorm.

This time, after targeting the Control King faction, if they also tore apart relations with Hundred Battle and Su Yu, life would be unbearable. Even if they knew these two were up to no good, they had no choice but to accept it!

Thunderstorm was speechless!

This time, everything was chaotic, but it also clearly distinguished the various factions.

Hundred Battle didn't even show up, yet Su Yu exposed them all. Su Yu was truly something else!

The two quickly pursued ahead. Tiangu and his group, carrying a bunch of Harmony Realm experts, weren't moving too fast. Before long, Tiangu sensed the aura coming from behind, and his expression changed.

The injured Desolate Celestial Sovereign looked even more displeased and couldn't help but turn back to curse, "Why are you two still following us?"

Bastards!

These two were traitors!

They even dared to follow back!

Marquis Tianming laughed, "Desolate Daoist, you can say that to Thunderstorm, but it has nothing to do with me! From start to finish, I've never betrayed anyone. As for Brother Thunderstorm... that's hard to say!"

Desolate Celestial Sovereign cursed silently!

Birds of a feather!

Who are you trying to fool?

However, at this moment, Su Yu hadn't gone far. This time, Su Yu's side had five Celestial Sovereigns appear in succession, plus Tianming, making it six. He didn't dare to tear apart relations with Tianming right now.

As for Thunderstorm, part of the Hundred Battle faction, with Hundred Battle not present, Desolate Celestial Sovereign's anger was directed at him, "Thunderstorm, you dare to follow us!"

Thunderstorm was speechless. Why are you picking on me?

I didn't provoke you!

He coldly said, "My clansmen are all in the Myriad Races Mountain. Naturally, I must return! Besides... what have I done? I'm not from the Demon Race, nor have I colluded with the Control King faction. I've always been killing enemies. Desolate, it's not your place to trouble me!"

Desolate Celestial Sovereign was furious!

Tiangu shouted, "Enough!"

He stopped their quarrel and said solemnly, "Everyone shut up. Let's return quickly and establish a defense system. Although we lost some Celestial Kings and Harmony Realm experts in this battle, overall, we didn't lose. It's a good thing!"

This time, Su Yu made a huge profit, but the Myriad Races didn't actually lose much.

Indeed, many Harmony Realm and Celestial Kings died.

But first, the Demon Race's thorn was removed, and Thunderstorm and Tianming were completely exposed. Additionally, many strong members of the Control King faction were killed, and a large number of ancient beasts were slain. The Hundred Battle faction was exposed...

For the Myriad Races, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. At least, no Celestial Sovereigns died.

At this point, many Celestial Sovereigns were injured, but at least they were alive.

The Immortal Race still had four Celestial Sovereigns, the God Race three, and the Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether each had one, totaling ten Celestial Sovereign-level beings. Thunderstorm and Tianming were left alone.

Ten Celestial Sovereign-level experts, among whom the Sacred Marquis, Sun Crown, and God Empress were very powerful. Even if Yao Qing and the Brolong Beast attacked together, the Myriad Races could still resist. Plus, there were many Harmony Realm experts, so at least in the short term, the Myriad Races could still hold their ground.

Tiangu quickly assessed everything.

Now, the entire Myriad Realms, the situation was completely clear!

The Human Race was divided into three, each not in harmony!!

The rest were the Myriad Races' forces!

As for the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger, they were considered independent forces, including the Martial Emperor and Nether Emperor, all considered independent forces.

The major forces were actually just four!

With ten Celestial Sovereigns, the Myriad Races were still a dominant force.

As for the fleeing Mo Celestial Sovereign, Tiangu guessed that he probably went to Ren Mountain and might have taken the Demon Race with him. He might soon join forces with the Control King faction, but even so, it didn't matter.

The Demon Race, this time, rashly aligned with the Control King faction, leading to the powerful Purple Cloud Marquis being taken out by Su Yu's side before he could even erupt. Tiangu even sympathized with the Demon Race.

Foolish!

Knowing Su Yu was here, they still dared to act recklessly.

If the Demon Halberd was leading the Demon Race, they would never have rashly switched allegiance to the Control King faction. Unfortunately, the Upper Realm wasn't under the Demon Halberd's control.

Su Yu, this guy, was very sinister.

His strength, until now, hadn't been fully revealed. Killing Yue Hao and the Brolong Beast's avatars was too fast, unbelievably fast. This strength was extraordinary. If he went all out, Tiangu even suspected that this guy might have the confidence to fight Yao Qing alone.

One thought after another flashed through his mind, and soon, the group reached Ren Mountain.

As soon as Tiangu returned, he indeed sensed that the Demon Race's camp had disappeared. As soon as they arrived, someone shouted, "Lords, Mo Celestial Sovereign returned and suddenly took away the Demon Realm's experts. We couldn't stop them..."

Tiangu waved his hand, not saying much.

Mo Celestial Sovereign wouldn't dare to slaughter while they were away. If he did, he would truly be cutting himself off from the world!

"Seal the mountain!"

Tiangu shouted, "Activate the mountain-sealing formation. No one is allowed to leave the mountain! All injured Celestial Sovereigns, heal immediately! Uninjured Celestial Sovereigns, quickly go to the Myriad Races Hall for a meeting and discussion!"

Many Celestial Sovereigns were injured, including the Immortal Race's Yuan Saint and Desolate Celestial Sovereign, who were both seriously injured.

The God Race's Moon Celestial Sovereign and God Empress were also injured.

The Dragon Celestial Sovereign was also injured.

This was also a good opportunity!

Tiangu quickly calculated, perhaps... they could take this opportunity to completely unify the Myriad Races' will. Although their side still lacked a ruler of laws to oversee, as long as the seal was broken, the Myriad Races would soon become a dominant force.

The situation hadn't deteriorated to an irreparable point!

The existence of Tianming and Thunderstorm wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

One represented Hundred Battle, the other represented Su Yu... If Mo Celestial Sovereign hadn't left, there could have been another representative for the Control King faction. Tiangu laughed at himself, well, it was almost like a sieve!

He quickly led the group, flying towards the peak of Ren Mountain to discuss how to respond next.

...

At the same time.

Su Yu and his group flew swiftly. A second Lantian avatar appeared and quickly said, "Your Majesty, Yue Luo and Yue Xiao seem to be passing through our territory. Should we deal with them?"

Su Yu calculated for a moment and quickly said, "No, but we can appropriately expose the existence of the Tea Plant. They won't dare to seek treasures now, but once things stabilize, they might come to investigate!"

Whether Zhou Ji knew about his own world was unknown. If he didn't know, maybe they could trap Yue Luo and the others once.

If he did know, then it would be a casual scheme.

Lantian understood and quickly transmitted the message.

After a while, Su Yu flew swiftly, and in the void, a broken continent appeared. Su Yu quickly opened the continent's surface and entered in the blink of an eye.

...

Upon entering, Su Yu clearly felt something different.

Hongmeng!

Yes, he saw Hongmeng, the aura leaking out. At this moment, this old turtle was very excited. Seeing Su Yu, he exclaimed, "Your Majesty, this old minister has broken through!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "Very good!"

This time, it was a huge gain!

Hongmeng and Tongtian both broke through, which was a great joy. Moreover, he collected countless corpses, all Harmony Realm, some Celestial Kings, and even Celestial Sovereigns, which could strengthen and perfect his world.

The Great Zhou King and others quickly arrived.

Wan Tiansheng quickly said, "Just now, Yue Luo and Yue Xiao passed through our territory, but they didn't come close, and we didn't take action!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "No rush! If we act now and kill them, it might provoke Hundred Battle! If they don't know about our world, maybe we can trap them once!"

He quickly looked at everyone, smiling, "Let's not talk about that. I'll first integrate my gains this time. This time, my world will surely evolve! Everyone can come and observe the ascension of the world!"

This time, he seized the power of several Celestial Sovereigns' great paths, along with many Harmony Realm experts.

In other words, this time, Su Yu made a huge profit, while the Myriad Races... made a small profit?

Su Yu thought to himself, after all, the Myriad Races' Celestial Sovereigns were still alive, they didn't lose much, just some Harmony Realm experts.

He quickly walked towards the end of the world, where the Human Lord Seal was located.

The group quickly followed. Heavendoom was somewhat envious, "Your Majesty, when will you take us out for a fight? Look, that old ghost Tongtian went out once and went from second-class to Celestial Sovereign!"

Every time a strong person went out with Su Yu, they would gain something. It's truly satisfying!

It's only satisfying to go out with Su Yu!

Those who don't go out can earn a bit, but nowhere near as much as those who do.

Tongtian laughed slyly, "No rush, Heavendoom, don't look at me just having advanced to Celestial Sovereign, it's actually nothing, don't envy... because... I'll soon be even stronger, hahaha!"

He laughed slyly!

Satisfying!

He had swallowed many gates and hadn't had time to digest them yet. Once he did, he would become even stronger.

扎心一次不够，他还扎心第二次！  
Heavendoom's face turned green with frustration. Beast!  

Su Yu and the others couldn't help but chuckle, but the Great Zhou King quickly said, "Your Majesty, it seems the Sin Clan is about to produce a second Master of Rules?"  

Su Yu nodded. "It's possible. The Granny Dragon Beast might be emerging!"  

The Great Zhou King's expression changed instantly. "That would mean two true Masters of Rules, and the Granny Dragon Beast is no weakling!"  

Although Su Yu and his group were engaged in battle, they couldn't see it from where they were. However, with Lantian acting as a war correspondent, constantly updating everyone, they all knew that even the avatars of the Granny Dragon Beast were formidable, let alone its true form!  

Su Yu smiled. "It's fine. It's better if it comes out. If it doesn't, the Sin Clan won't be significant enough. If it does, we can divide the forces! Without the Sin Clan, Hundred Battle and his group might gain an advantage. Weakening them is the goal! Killing the Celestial Sovereigns is also preparation for unsealing later... Otherwise, once unsealed, many Masters of Rules will emerge from all sides!"  

Unsealing?  

The Great Zhou King's eyes flickered. "Your Majesty is preparing to unseal?"  

"Yes!"  

Su Yu smiled. "But not now. On our side, March, Fate, Giant Axe, and Hongmeng have all reached the Celestial Sovereign level without relying on my Great Dao. We need to wait a bit longer. Once you, Great Zhou King, reach the Celestial Sovereign domain, and Fire Cloud Marquis, Doubao, and September also reach the Celestial Sovereign level, I might consider unsealing."  

It's not enough now!  

However, Fire Cloud Marquis and these Heavenly Kings haven't merged with Su Yu's Great Dao. Once they reach the Celestial Sovereign level, Su Yu will find a way to unseal. At that time, the number of Masters of Rules on his side will surpass those of the Myriad Races and Hundred Battle, and Su Yu will unseal.  

Of course, it's best to kill some Celestial Sovereigns from the Myriad Races and Hundred Battle's subordinates. Only when the advantage is concentrated on his side will Su Yu consider it.  

The Great Zhou King nodded slightly.  

As for Wan Tiansheng and Lantian, it's different. Even if they have Celestial Sovereign combat power, they can't become Masters of Rules after unsealing. They have the strength but not the realm.  

Behind them, Doubao and the others exchanged glances, feeling a bit lonely.  

When will we reach the Celestial Sovereign level?  

Su Yu quickly said, "There are still opportunities. Now that my world has just opened, it's the best time to comprehend the Great Dao! Every sublimation is a blossoming of the Great Dao, and the insights will help the strong in my world, and they will help you too!"  

Su Yu smiled. "With more opportunities, you can naturally become Celestial Sovereigns! If not... it's fine. As my world sublimates, maybe it will meet the conditions to produce Masters of Rules!"  

Hearing this, everyone became much more excited.  

A group of people quickly entered the Human Lord Seal.  

At this moment, Supervisor Tianhou was still sealed. Seeing so many people entering, he was slightly surprised. Seeing their strength, he was even more shocked.  

He looked at Su Yu and said in a deep voice, "The Human Lord seems... to have grown stronger in fortune!"  

Su Yu chuckled. "Really? Maybe, but it's not something to worry about!"  

With that, he suddenly threw out over a hundred corpses!  

Supervisor Tianhou was shocked.  

These corpses included ancient beasts, members of the Control King's lineage, and the Myriad Races, but all possessed the strength of the Harmony Dao. Supervisor Tianhou was shocked. How many people has Su Yu killed?  

It's terrifying!  

Not only that, but the next moment, Su Yu released some power of laws, among which several were incredibly powerful!  

Su Yu didn't care much and shouted, "Lantian!"  

Lantian quickly appeared. Su Yu looked at the corpses and smiled. "Help me connect my Dao with the Time Dao, and draw the power of the Great Dao from the Myriad Races' corpses into my Great Dao. Let's fleece them!"  

"As for the ancient beasts' corpses... just integrate them directly!"  

Su Yu quickly manipulated, waving his hand. In the Human Lord Seal, thousands of Great Daos emerged. Su Yu looked at everyone and said solemnly, "I will once again open the source of the Great Dao for you. Everyone, comprehend well! I hope that on our side, more Celestial Sovereigns and strong individuals will emerge! Now that a Master of Rules has officially appeared, once one appears, the rest won't be far behind! The Martial Emperor and the Nether Emperor are about to break their seals, and the Gate of Hell might become the first era to open. The Human Emperor and others will appear..."  

Su Yu said solemnly, "Don't count on the Human Emperor and the others. To be blunt, if they were strong enough, they would have returned long ago. Their absence means they're not strong enough! Only self-rescue and self-reliance will work! Don't think that once the Human Emperor returns, everything will be fine... wishful thinking! Their return only means one thing... we're in big trouble! With so many Masters of Rules among the Myriad Races, it will only plunge us into crisis!"  

"I have only one goal: before they return, if we don't have 10 Masters of Rules on our side, life will be unbearable!"  

"..."  

Everyone was also solemn.  

10 Masters of Rules!  

That's no small number.  

Su Yu said no more. The myriad Daos manifested, and with a low shout, the ancient beasts' corpses turned to dust, instantly shattering. A large amount of refined chaotic power quickly integrated into various Great Daos!  

This is different from the chaotic power in chaos. Ancient beasts actually have some attribute inclinations.  

They're not entirely chaotic!  

At this moment, each Great Dao absorbed this chaotic power and quickly grew stronger.  

Some Great Daos, which were previously weak, also became stronger.  

Lantian also quickly manipulated the Myriad Races' corpses, connecting the River of Time and Su Yu's Great Dao, linking the corresponding power of the Great Dao.  

Lantian quickly shattered one corpse after another!  

At this moment, Su Yu's world was visibly trembling and began to expand!  

One Great Dao after another shimmered with light.  

Heavendoom and the others also extended their willpower, finding the corresponding Great Dao and beginning to sense.  

Or rather, comprehend.  

Su Yu opened the Great Dao, essentially sharing all his insights into the Great Dao. Whatever he comprehends, they comprehend.  

Everyone was comprehending and understanding.  

At this moment, it was exceptionally quiet.  

Only the sound of the world's trembling could be heard.  

The previous battle seemed to have been completely forgotten. Every time Su Yu returned, he brought back a large number of spoils. His purpose in every battle was simple: first, weaken the opponent; second, strengthen himself.  

Su Yu never participated in meaningless battles.  

The world roared continuously!  

And at this moment, Su Yu took out a mass of power of laws, which was from Marquis Ziyun, a top-tier Celestial Sovereign's power of the Great Dao, an insight into the power of thunder.  

Su Yu found his own Thunder Dao and instantly integrated Marquis Ziyun's power of the Great Dao.  

In an instant, countless insights flooded into Su Yu's mind.  

Thunder!  

Lightning!  

Su Yu had also mastered the Thunder character divine text, one of the divine texts he mastered early on. Back then, to deal with the Thunder God Race's experts, he had deliberately been struck by lightning many times to personally comprehend the Thunder Great Dao.  

At this moment, among the myriad Daos, thunder flickered.  

Boom!  

Lightning erupted, thunder and lightning roared!  

Su Yu closed his eyes to comprehend, and among the crowd, someone was silently comprehending the changes in the Thunder Great Dao.  

Under Su Yu's command, there weren't many who walked the Thunder Great Dao.  

At this moment, someone suddenly spoke, "Human Lord Su, I want... to change my Dao!"  

Su Yu turned his head and was slightly taken aback.  

The West King's Consort calmly said, "The Petrification Great Dao isn't truly my Dao; it's a pseudo-Dao from the Human Emperor's Great Dao! I once comprehended a lot of the Thunder Great Dao in the past. Today, as I observe the thunder, perhaps I should change my Dao! Since both are pseudo-Daos, cultivating the Human Emperor's pseudo-Dao... who knows if the Human Emperor will continue to open the heavens or if he can even return alive..."  

The Great Zhou King looked at her, but the West King's Consort remained calm. "So, I want to switch to the Human Lord's Thunder Great Dao! I will integrate my pseudo-Petrification Great Dao into His Majesty's world. Whoever wants to walk the Petrification Great Dao, I can bestow all my insights upon them! Personally, I want to integrate into the world and cultivate the Thunder Great Dao!"  

She was a Heavenly King, so Su Yu hadn't let her change her Dao before.  

Heavenly Kings, only a few had integrated so far.  

For instance, Snow Orchid and Giant Bamboo Marquis had exploded their power of the Great Dao before integrating, and the West King's Consort was the first to actively request a change of Dao.  

The West King's Consort continued, "This Thunder Great Dao is very strong. I can feel its powerful intent, likely from Marquis Ziyun's power of the Great Dao. If I can comprehend even a little, I might quickly become a Celestial Sovereign like Marquis Ziyun... Although in the Human Lord's world, I might not be able to exert such strong power outside, but as the Human Lord grows stronger, I believe I can quickly become a Master of Rules!"  

Su Yu raised an eyebrow slightly. "Are you sure you want to change?"  

"Yes!"  

Su Yu smiled. "You're saying that the potential of the Human Emperor's Great Dao is not as great as my Great Dao?"  

The West King's Consort was silent for a moment before nodding. "Correct!"  

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King, who was helpless and remained silent. Why are you looking at me?  

You're insulting the Human Emperor; can you not do it in front of me?  

Su Yu laughed heartily. "Alright, I have no objections! You're cultivating the pseudo-Petrification Great Dao, so integrating it into my world is a good thing. It can also strengthen the Petrification Great Dao!"  

He had originally thought of giving this Thunder Great Dao to someone else, as there were people among the Thirty-Six Guardians who cultivated the Thunder Great Dao.  

But if the West King's Consort wanted it... it was also a good thing.  

This consort of the third-generation Human Lord had never truly integrated into Su Yu's system, but once integrated into his world, she would be part of the system, and it would be difficult to break away!  

Soon, Su Yu presented the Thunder Great Dao and the Petrification Great Dao.  

The West King's Consort was an expert in this area. She quickly separated her Petrification Great Dao and integrated it into Su Yu's Petrification Great Dao. Then, she began to accept the inheritance of the Thunder Great Dao. Although she hadn't primarily cultivated the Thunder Great Dao in the past, she had studied it as a secondary path.  

At this moment, she quickly accepted the power of this Great Dao, and her aura began to grow stronger.  

She was originally a Heavenly King expert, and her comprehension had reached the Heavenly King level.

In Su Yu's world, he willingly opened up all the sources of his Great Dao, allowing others to comprehend them. This was a rare occurrence, but Su Yu was focused on strengthening everyone's power and cultivating the first batch of core members in his world. He didn't pay much attention to the potential consequences.

In the future, such opportunities might not be available. It was impossible for anyone to merge with the Dao and have unrestricted access to his insights into the power of the Great Dao. This was the origin of the saying, "When one person attains enlightenment, even their pets ascend to heaven."

At the beginning, there was a chance. But once Su Yu attained enlightenment, that opportunity would no longer exist.

One by one, the experts quickly comprehended the power of the Great Dao. Meanwhile, Lantian, who was connecting the River of Time with Su Yu's Great Dao, was also undergoing a transformation. The power of the River of Time and Su Yu's Dao insights were flowing into him.

Lantian's aura gradually grew stronger. His path in the River of Time, the Path of All Life, seemed to have advanced further. Originally, Lantian didn't have such a strong foundation, but Su Yu was bestowing it upon him. Thousands of characters and his own Dao origins were all open to Lantian, who spent almost all his time in the Human Lord Seal.

His avatars constantly witnessed Su Yu and the others battling the Heavenly Sovereigns and the Masters of Rules. At this moment, Lantian's aura was growing stronger, almost reaching the level of a Heavenly Sovereign in terms of power, though not in realm.

And what he needed was power.

Su Yu watched silently, feeling a myriad of emotions. Everyone was progressing!

Lantian had the hope of becoming a Heavenly Sovereign, which was a great joy. This battle had yielded tremendous gains.

Not only that... At this moment, Fat Ball, who was in a daze, also seemed to be on the verge of a breakthrough.

Su Yu's gaze instantly shifted to Fat Ball!

His eyes flickered. If Fat Ball advanced, it would be a game-changer. Fat Ball, without turning dark, hadn't reached the combat power of a Heavenly Sovereign. But if the White Dog attained Heavenly Sovereign strength, then the Black Dog would be a top-tier Heavenly Sovereign, right?

Coupled with the Culture King's boots...

At this moment, Su Yu felt a surge of excitement. He longed for a true top-tier expert to emerge from his side, someone comparable to the likes of Sun Corona and Saint Marquis, or even stronger, like Chaos Dragon and Moon Battle.

Fat Ball had twice devoured the willpower of the Granny Dragon Beast, both times absorbing incredibly powerful willpower. If Fat Ball could advance, Su Yu would be overjoyed!

...

Nearby, Marquis Tianjian was dazzled by what he saw.

He witnessed the rapid progress of the experts under Su Yu's command. He even noticed that the previously timid and cowardly Duobao was also advancing.

Duobao's path was rather unique.

The Path of Treasures!

The more treasures he had, the more treasure aura he accumulated, and the faster Duobao progressed.

Previously, Duobao didn't have many treasures.

But now, Duobao was sneakily absorbing the treasure aura emanating from the treasures in Su Yu's world.

Were there many treasures in Su Yu's world?

Too many!

The Mark of Civilization was one, the Book of the Great Dao was another, and the Human Lord Seal was yet another!

These were all supreme treasures!

Moreover, the act of opening the heavens was inherently accompanied by the appearance of treasures. Duobao continuously absorbed the treasure aura, and not only that, Marquis Tianjian saw Duobao sneakily approaching Marquis Tongtian!

This one might be the greatest treasure of all.

The Gate!

No gate was simple.

Duobao approached Marquis Tongtian, his chubby face showing a sly smile, just like the sly old man Marquis Tongtian. Both were quite sly, but at this moment, Duobao appeared even more so, sidling up behind Marquis Tongtian, enjoying the scent emanating from him.

Bit by bit, he absorbed the treasure aura.

He was very comfortable!

Very satisfied!

The quality of Marquis Tongtian's treasure aura was incredibly high, frighteningly so. The key was that Marquis Tongtian had consumed too many gates, causing treasure aura to continuously spill out, mixed with the treasure aura of the Gate of Hell.

Duobao greedily absorbed it!

He was immensely enjoying it!

At this moment, Su Yu happened to notice this scene. He turned his head and was stunned. The sly Duobao had his nose almost pressed against Marquis Tongtian's backside, constantly sniffing, absorbing, and enjoying it!

A satisfied smile appeared on his face!

This... was too sly!

However, Duobao's aura was indeed growing stronger.

Perhaps this guy had never absorbed so much treasure aura in his life, and now he was lost in ecstasy.

As Su Yu looked over, many others also turned their attention to the scene.

Their expressions became peculiar!

Meanwhile, Marquis Tongtian was still oblivious, still digesting the power of the gates, until he felt numerous gazes upon him. Only then did he open his eyes, seeing everyone looking at him with strange expressions.

What's going on?

Quickly, he sensed something, turned around, and upon seeing the scene, his face froze!

Duobao's nose was twitching incessantly, almost touching his backside!

Marquis Tongtian's face turned green!

He had always been the one to act slyly towards others, and today, he was being harassed by a fat guy!

Damn it!

Without a word, Marquis Tongtian kicked Duobao away. Only then did Duobao open his eyes, looking bewildered. When he saw everyone staring at him, he seemed to realize something, his expression changing slightly, feeling a bit embarrassed.

He wanted to say, I was just absorbing a bit of treasure aura!

Marquis Tongtian smelled too good!

But... he couldn't say it out loud.

Marquis Tongtian was just a gate, genderless, but this guy had taken on the form of a sly old man. Sniffing his backside... was indeed a bit disgusting!

He chuckled awkwardly!

Marquis Tongtian cursed and warned, "Don't get any ideas about me. I'm telling you, there's no possibility between us!"

Duobao rolled his eyes furiously!

Meanwhile, Su Yu chuckled and suddenly tossed out a large club. "Absorb the treasure aura from this. Tianmie, you can use it to merge!"

"This is..."

Duobao looked at the treasure. It wasn't weak!

"The weapon of the Immortal Battle Marquis!"

Su Yu smiled. "That guy survived this time. Maybe he also has a chance to become a Heavenly Sovereign! Let's break his weapon first. Tianmie, your weapon is a bit outdated!"

Tianmie bared his teeth, smiling as he looked at Duobao, his gaze threatening, don't absorb too much!

A good treasure!

An ancient weapon of a Heavenly King, strengthened over many years, this was a great treasure!

Just as everyone was talking, suddenly, a loud boom erupted. A powerful aura burst forth from Lantian, causing Su Yu's world to tremble. In an instant, Su Yu's world expanded slightly.

Lantian opened his eyes, revealing a faint smile. Soon, his smile blossomed like a flower. This time, he couldn't hold back and suddenly transformed into a charming lady, sweetly saying, "Your Majesty, I've broken through!"

"…"

Su Yu got goosebumps all over, maintaining his composure as he said, "Good, congratulations! Fellow Daoist... you still look better as a man!"

Next time, when I meet Yue Luo, I'll definitely beat her to death!

Definitely!

I can't bring myself to hit Lantian, but beating Yue Luo will vent my frustration.

Everyone stifled their laughter, and just then, another rumble sounded. Su Yu's world expanded once more, and a surge of thunderous power erupted. In this world, Consort Qi's aura suddenly surged, reaching the level of a Heavenly Sovereign and continuing to climb!

Soon, Consort Qi's aura reached a peak, vaguely similar to the previous Heavenly Fire of the Fire God Race, before stopping.

Consort Qi opened her eyes instantly, looking at Su Yu with a slightly complex expression. She bowed slightly, "Qi Rong, greets Your Majesty!"

Qi Rong!

Your Majesty!

At this moment, no one spoke. This consort of the third generation Human Lord, who had always addressed Su Yu as Human Lord, Su Human Lord, today, after integrating into Su Yu's world, changed her form of address.

And her aura had grown to the peak of a Heavenly Sovereign.

Outside, she might even be able to exert the power of a weak Heavenly Sovereign.

Under Su Yu's command, more and more experts were emerging.

Lantian advanced, Qi Rong advanced, Tongtian advanced, Hongmeng advanced...

And Fat Ball, wobbling, suddenly bit into Doubao under the stimulation of everyone's advancement, crunching it into a dough with a tooth mark left behind.

At this moment, Fat Ball suddenly opened its eyes, holding Doubao in its mouth, while Doubao stared back at it with wide eyes.

Damn it!

Why did you bite me?

Fat Ball felt a bit embarrassed, quickly spitting it out, and said with some joy, "I... seem to have become stronger!"

Su Yu nodded with a smile!

At this moment, he couldn't hide his smile any longer!

Under my command, strong individuals are as numerous as clouds!

And just then, Wan Tiansheng suddenly looked at the Great Zhou King, whose face stiffened. He transmitted a message, "Stop looking at me. I really can't quickly enter the Heavenly Sovereign realm..."

Wan Tiansheng transmitted a threatening message, "If you don't advance now, I'll tell His Majesty that you've been scheming against him all along!"

Damn you!

The Great Zhou King cursed furiously. Wan Tiansheng was a scoundrel.

As if advancing to the Heavenly Sovereign realm was simple!

Get lost!

Despite the curses, the Great Zhou King held back his anger, endured, and thought, holding it in...

Moments later, a surge of fury erupted!

Under the puzzled gazes of everyone, the Great Zhou King suddenly transformed into a giant, roaring with overwhelming anger, "Enough is enough! No more patience! Watch this!"

Boom!

He threw a punch, and Wan Tiansheng quickly retreated, but was blocked by the Great Zhou King's punch, sealing off all directions. The Great Zhou King roared, "Endure! Silence! Stillness!"

Wan Tiansheng frowned, "Rage!"

In an instant, he too transformed into a wrathful Vajra.

Suddenly, two immensely angry giants began fighting fiercely within the Human Lord Seal!

Everyone watched, dumbfounded!

These two were usually refined individuals.

Today, at this moment, they were like barbarians, fighting madly, each punch landing solidly!

The Great Zhou King was at his wit's end, consumed by rage!

And Wan Tiansheng embodied the seven emotions and six desires, joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, life, death, yin, and yang!

In the blink of an eye, the two were beaten black and blue!

One punch, another punch, you rage, I rage even more!

Amidst the overwhelming fury, their long hair flew wildly, almost standing on end. The two white-robed cultivators, now with torn clothes, exposed muscles, clashing with a resounding boom, their muscles splitting, blood splattering everywhere!

One punch, another punch, you hit my chest, I hammer your head!

Under the shocked gazes of Su Yu and the others, the two furious individuals' auras continued to rise, rising continuously.

Boom!

With a loud bang, Wan Tiansheng punched the Great Zhou King's nose, causing it to collapse, while the Great Zhou King kicked Wan Tiansheng's crotch, causing his pants to split...

Chapter 1: A Clash of Titans

In the midst of a fierce confrontation, two figures were sent flying, crashing into the barrier of the Human Lord Seal. In the next moment, their auras surged violently, a thunderous roar echoing in the air. Two overwhelming presences erupted simultaneously!

In an instant, the two figures reappeared. Almost immediately, the bruises and swelling on their faces vanished, their white robes reemerged, muscles disappeared, and long hair cascaded down. In the blink of an eye, they returned to their refined and courteous appearances.

"Congratulations, Dao Brother!"

"Congratulations to you too!"

The two exchanged formal bows, their smiles radiant.

The Great Zhou King beamed, "Daoist Wan, your strength is formidable. I am truly in awe!"

Wan Tiansheng's smile was even brighter, "Dao Brother, you flatter me. I am not even a tenth of your prowess!"

"You're being modest!"

"No, truly, Dao Brother's strength surpasses mine by a margin!"

"You're too humble... Daoist Wan, please don't say that..."

The two continued their exchange of pleasantries, bowing and smiling at each other. For a moment, the onlookers were left dumbfounded.

Were these the same people who had just been fighting? Surely, we must have seen it wrong! How could these scholarly gentlemen have been pounding their chests like gorillas just moments ago? Their hair had been standing on end, their clothes in tatters—certainly, it wasn't them!

Yes, we must have been mistaken!

Among the crowd, Su Yu remained calm, discreetly putting away the recording talisman. Another piece of gossip collected—excellent. When I retire, I must document all of this!

At that moment, both the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng turned their gazes towards Su Yu, smiles on their faces but a hint of frustration in their eyes. It was him again! Recording once more! Enough already! Who doesn't have a bit of a past? Why do you keep recording everything? Are you really planning to pass this down to future generations? That would be too much!

Meanwhile, Su Yu, unfazed, wore a smile even more dazzling than theirs. "Fortune smiles upon me, Su Yu! Congratulations to both of you on your advancement!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Today is indeed my lucky day, truly fortunate!"

"Ha ha ha!"

It was indeed a lucky day. After defeating the Control King's lineage, perhaps fortune was truly on his side. In just one day, numerous advancements were made.

At this moment, under Su Yu's command, the number of Heavenly Sovereigns was astonishing. Many had ascended to the rank of Heavenly Sovereign!

Fat Ball, March, Giant Axe, Tongtian, Wan Tiansheng, the Great Zhou King, Lantian, Tianming, South Heavenly King, and Hongmeng—all had become Heavenly Sovereigns!

There were also several pseudo-Heavenly Sovereigns. Lanshan, Tianhuo, and Consort Qi, within Su Yu's domain, could also exert the power of a Heavenly Sovereign. Additionally, some Heavenly Kings might soon follow.

Su Yu's smile grew even brighter! Life was truly delightful! At this rate, it wouldn't be long before a Master of Rules emerged under his command! Those with true Heavenly Sovereign power already exceeded ten! Both inside and outside, they were Heavenly Sovereigns.

Su Yu laughed, his smile radiant. In the next moment, he glanced at Huoyun Marquis and Doubao, their expressions turning sour. Why weren't they Heavenly Sovereigns yet? Useless!

"......"

Doubao and the others quickly avoided Su Yu's gaze, feeling utterly defeated! Even Heavendoom and the others avoided Su Yu's eyes. Don't look at us! The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King also looked up at the sky, one by one.

Life was truly unbearable. They were progressing rapidly, but compared to the Great Zhou King and the others, damn it, did reading more books really make them so remarkable? Their progress was just too fast!

In a corner, the Monitor of Heaven Marquis could almost visibly see Su Yu's fortune swelling rapidly. The Monitor of Heaven Marquis sighed inwardly. Su Yu was becoming more and more terrifying! He had witnessed firsthand how, in just one day, Su Yu's side was overflowing with Heavenly Sovereigns! At this rate, Su Yu wouldn't need to rely on anyone else. His side alone could establish dominance!

"The ancient era... perhaps... should truly come to an end with Su Yu's generation!" The Monitor of Heaven Marquis thought, sighing.
