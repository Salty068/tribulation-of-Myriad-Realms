Chapter 850: When You Were Born, I Was Already Old (A Thousand Updates Begging for Subscription)

Dao Source Land.

Su Yu had returned once more.

This time, he came openly, not to fleece anyone, but to save the Human Emperor! The Human Emperor was in dire straits! Even if he wanted to integrate his own world, it was difficult, and he risked being overwhelmed. To prevent the Human Emperor from dying, Su Yu had no choice but to help him weaken his own world.

As Su Yu stepped into the Dao Source Land, he mused aloud, "A powerhouse like the Human Emperor doesn't want to be weakened. Even if it means death, he still wants to create two first-class beings. But that's unnecessary!"

Su Yu shook his head. "The path of others is ultimately theirs. A talent like the Human Emperor, given time, can rise again even if weakened. But he's reluctant to cut his losses, or perhaps he didn't dare before, and still doesn't dare now."

The Human Emperor knew he could be saved, but the burden was too great. His success and failure both stemmed from the Dao of Responsibility. His path as the Human Emperor was likely tied to responsibility, and the Dao influenced the world, inevitably.

The Great Zhou King listened, half-understanding, but he grasped the gist of Su Yu's words. In a deep voice, he asked, "Your Majesty means the Human Emperor can still be saved? He won't die?"

"Of course!" Su Yu laughed. "A powerhouse like him, as long as he's not instantly killed, won't die so easily! The Human Emperor always says he's going to die because of his heavy responsibilities. But think about it, who's saving him now?"

The Great Zhou King looked at Su Yu, who appeared indifferent. "Why are you looking at me? Am I, Su Yu, not as good as the Human Emperor? I've overcome even greater difficulties, so why not now? At worst, I'll retreat to the Myriad Realms, lie low, and wait for the Three Gates to open. I don't believe the powerhouses inside the Three Gates are united. How could three eras of people be of one mind?"

"So, with me here, what's he worried about? There's nothing to worry about!"

The Human Emperor feared being too weakened, thinking it better to birth two first-class rulers. But in Su Yu's view, even if the Human Emperor was weakened to second-class, he'd still be stronger than two first-class beings!

Thus, his thoughts differed from the Human Emperor's. The Human Emperor was reluctant to have his world's power extracted, fearing it would weaken his world. But Su Yu didn't care. If the world weakened, so be it. What's the big deal?

As long as the world's foundation remained, there was hope for resurgence! A figure like the Human Emperor, daring to start anew, wouldn't rise slowly. It was time to lighten the load! Why burden oneself so heavily, constantly lamenting, "I'm going to die"? Su Yu found the Human Emperor's behavior quite irritating!

When Su Yu voiced these thoughts, the Great Zhou King's face turned purple. Irritating? If the Human Emperor heard this, he'd beat Su Yu up, risking his life. Who dared call the Human Emperor irritating?

Su Yu continued, "So, my plan is to extract the power from his world, let part of it collapse, and retain the essence. Start anew! Then, integrate into the world. If he wants to reshape his body, he can. If he wants to become a woman, that's fine too!"

"Your Majesty..." The Great Zhou King looked conflicted. Please don't say that. He's my old master! I'm in a tough spot! If I could, I'd fight you!

Su Yu chuckled, unconcerned, and continued, "I'll extract most of the Dao power from his world into mine, leaving the source untouched. Also, his Human Emperor Dao..."

Su Yu quickly added, "When I return, I'll extract the power from his Human Emperor Dao too! This way, both sides will be weakened. Then, let him integrate into the world or the Dao. Once stable, reintegrate the Human Emperor Dao into his world for enhancement..."

This was Su Yu's plan.

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly. "Will the Human Emperor agree? This would waste the potential for two first-class worlds and Daos."

"You're all so indecisive!" Su Yu scolded, annoyed. "Hesitating over everything! Do I, Su Yu, care about those two first-class beings? As long as the Human Emperor lives, he's more effective than two first-class beings. Don't you understand this?"

Su Yu grew impatient. "I'm just informing you, not asking for your decision. The Human Emperor doesn't have a say either! He's incapacitated now, so I call the shots. If he doesn't listen, I'll smash his world!"

"Alright!" The Great Zhou King instantly fell silent. He knew Su Yu's character. If Su Yu insisted, there was no stopping him. As for the Human Emperor... well, the Human Emperor was generally accommodating to his own people, often showing favoritism to his strong allies. If Su Yu forced this, the Human Emperor probably wouldn't refuse.

...

Ignoring the Great Zhou King, Su Yu tore through the void, entering the Human Emperor's world and Dao. He headed straight for the end of the Human Emperor's Responsibility Dao, where the river of time still flowed. Without a word, Su Yu extended strands of Dao power, swiftly sealing the breach!

He needed to block this gap first! The Human Emperor was incapacitated; what use was such a large gap? It was best to strip his world away entirely!

As Su Yu sealed the gap, the Dao seemed to sense something, trembling slightly.

"Who?"

Bang!

Su Yu punched out, causing the Dao to tremble. The voice that had just emerged vanished instantly!

The Great Zhou King gaped in shock!

Damn!

Is this how you persuade the Human Emperor?

...

Simultaneously.

In the gathering place.

The Human Emperor, who was in seclusion maintaining his sea of will, suddenly shuddered, his mouth agape. Damn!

What's going on?

Su Yu had returned and entered my world. What's he doing? I just wanted to ask a question, say hello, and this madman suddenly punched me, shattering my meager willpower and nearly disrupting my healing.

"He's insane!"

The Human Emperor was exasperated. I've roamed the world for countless years, and I'm this kid's senior, right? Why is he so rude to me?

He wanted to complain but thought better of it. After all, he wasn't managing that world anymore. Let Su Yu do as he pleased!

The key was, what was he doing? At this moment, the Human Emperor didn't quite understand Su Yu's intentions. It seemed like he was sealing the gap in my world!

...

Dao Source Land.

The Great Zhou King opened his mouth, speechless for a long time, while Su Yu continued to repair the massive breach. He wove chaos power, sealing the gap, but it was truly enormous!

Su Yu couldn't help but curse. Back then, did you think your world would grow quickly by opening such a large gap? Ha!

It was doomed from the start, a waste to open such a large gap. Now, it's hard to close!

Su Yu continued weaving chaos power, repairing the gap. The barrier of the river of time was composed of chaos power. Su Yu had done this once before, so he had experience. However, the river's mouth was indeed too large. Even with his current strength, far surpassing his past self, the torrent of river water was exhausting. He couldn't help but curse, "Might as well have let it explode last time!"

"Your Majesty, are you sealing this gap?" the Great Zhou King asked. Su Yu thought of something and turned, "Go to the end over there, call Lantian, and connect the Human Emperor's Dao with my world. I'll extract some power!"

"This..."

"Quick!"

Su Yu barked, and the Great Zhou King, helpless, thought, I just wanted to say I don't want to deal with that pervert Lantian. Last time, he disgusted me!

Forget it, Su Yu probably doesn't want to hear my explanation. Besides, it's best if Su Yu doesn't find out about this. Hopefully, those bastards didn't record it, or Su Yu will definitely demand it!

Whoever dares record me, I'll definitely retaliate!

The Great Zhou King silently vowed revenge. Yes, revenge is a must!

And so, the matter passed.

Soon, the Great Zhou King left to find Lantian. Lantian was more useful than Liu Hong, at least in this situation.

Meanwhile, Su Yu continued repairing the massive gap. Bit by bit, he worked. This was possible in the Myriad Realms; in the upper reaches before, he wouldn't have had the time to waste.

Su Yu swiftly repaired, and the enormous gap began to shrink. The river's impact was no longer as terrifying as before. He could endure it, no longer needing the Human Emperor's Xingyu Imprint.

"The Human Emperor has a Human Emperor Seal, said to be the number one artifact in the heavens... Maybe it can be used as a foundation!"

Su Yu calculated continuously. "Also, this world's power shouldn't be wasted. It's been purified by the Human Emperor's world, but it's not quite suitable for me. I'll extract a bit, and the rest can be left for others!"

The reason being, the Human Emperor's world contained too much of the Responsibility Dao's power. Strictly speaking, the Human Emperor's Dao was quite a trap!

Like Ren Mountain, which was merely the Human Emperor's physical body, but it influenced those living on it. Over time, everyone would see the human race as their responsibility. Su Yu had known this for a long time. The myriad races hadn't occupied Ren Mountain for this reason. Later, when the myriad races wanted to gather, they did so on Ren Mountain because it was incredibly sturdy, hard to break.

The Human Emperor's world power was similar, subtly influencing people. Some pseudo-dao powerhouses of the past, over time, would also become more inclined towards the human race.

This thing was like poison.

At least for Su Yu, it was. The phenomenon of people influencing people was extremely severe!

"These powers are suitable for the few strong from the myriad races who joined us earlier. The Great Zhou King and others should absorb some, and the Martial Emperor should absorb more..."

Su Yu calculated in his heart. I'll absorb a little less, let them absorb more.

Soon, a harmonious family will be forged.

I work for everyone, and everyone works for me!

The Human Emperor's world... Su Yu had to admit, it was impressive. No wonder the Culture King avoided it like the plague! If it were him, he'd avoid it too. It was terrifying! It's not scary if the Human Emperor acts like a saint; what's scary is if he thinks everyone should be a saint. That's truly frightening.

With these thoughts in mind, when Lantian connected his own path with the Human Emperor's path, Su Yu quickly manipulated the world, drawing a large amount of power from the Human Emperor's path. Most of this power, Su Yu channeled into the Path of the Flesh. As long as it didn't spread throughout the entire world, Su Yu would be affected only slightly, while the Path of the Flesh cultivators would remain unaffected.

...

At that moment.

In the gathering place.

The Martial Emperor, who was in the process of merging with the Path of the Flesh, suddenly had a flicker in his eyes. He turned to look at the people chatting behind him and suddenly frowned, "Enough talking, focus on your cultivation. Your strength hasn't improved, yet you have time to chat? Wu Ji, if there's anything you don't understand, you can ask me. You're also on the martial path, similar to mine..."

"......"

The entire place fell silent!

Is he crazy?

Wu Ji looked terrified. What was wrong with the Martial Emperor?

The Martial Emperor also shook his head slightly, feeling a sense of foreboding, and couldn't help but curse inwardly. Damn, what's wrong with me? Why am I bothering with Wu Ji? Why do I care about them? Seriously! Only a fool would care about these guys. I should just stick with Su Yu, get to the first rank, and then go find Taishan for revenge... Wait, Taishan is also a human, do I really have to kill him?

The next moment, he was horrified. Damn, Taishan, my arch-enemy, of course, I have to take revenge! What the hell? He was utterly terrified, though he was aware of the situation deep down. But thinking was one thing, and soon, he couldn't help but have a second thought. Why bother? We're all humans, let's not do this...

"What the hell?"

The Martial Emperor cursed inwardly, but he did feel that the Path of the Flesh seemed stronger, more powerful! Why did he feel that merging with the Path of the Flesh made him stronger than before he severed his path? Strange, has Su Yu become this formidable? Could he really turn the Path of the Flesh into a first-rank path? If so, then I have hope!

Thinking of this, when he saw Wu Ji's terrified expression, he couldn't help but shout angrily, "What are you looking at? Foolish insect, come here and listen to me explain the martial path to you!"

"......"

Wu Ji became even more terrified, casting a pleading look at the others. At this moment, the others all had a look in their eyes that said, go ahead, he won't kill you, at most he'll just chat about life... But if you don't go, none of us can afford to provoke the Martial Emperor!

Wu Ji was utterly helpless. His path was indeed similar to the Martial Emperor's, but... he didn't want to learn from the Martial Emperor. The Martial Emperor might not even be willing to teach him sincerely. With the Martial Emperor's personality, it would be a miracle if he taught him!

He was extremely frustrated!

Behind him, someone was gloating, but as soon as they smiled, the Martial Emperor glared and shouted, "Big Monkey, you come and listen too! I am proficient in various weapon paths, you come too!"

Heavendoom was dumbfounded. I... I don't want to go!

Just as he was about to speak, the Martial Emperor, fierce and menacing, roared, "If you dare refuse, I'll slap you to death right now, Big Monkey. Do you think you can match me?"

Cursing Heavendoom, the Martial Emperor couldn't help but curse inwardly again. Damn, why do I care about this Big Monkey? Am I sick? But today, looking at them, he suddenly felt a sense of frustration at their wasted potential. Each one of them was wasting time, useless!

If this continues, how can they live up to everyone, to the race, to Emperor Yu?

"Hmm?"

The Martial Emperor shook his head, feeling a chill in his heart. Damn, after merging with Su Yu's path, do I passively think Su Yu is awesome? No wonder I feel something's off, it's terrifying!

In the distance, the Human Emperor, who was in seclusion healing, suddenly opened his eyes, looking at the Martial Emperor. He vaguely saw a trace of power dissipating. The next moment, he opened his mouth, speechless for a long time.

This... Su Yu, that brat, is he drawing power from my world?

The Martial Emperor was clearly influenced by some of my world's power!

"Well..."

The Human Emperor glanced over, thought for a moment, and nodded. It's not bad. The Martial Emperor, this person, has no sense of good and evil, no sense of right and wrong, and acts as he pleases. Now, receiving some of my path's influence isn't bad.

The Human Emperor nodded slightly, it's acceptable! My path, I wouldn't normally teach or preach to just anyone. You, Martial Emperor, being able to listen to the rhythm of my path, is a bargain for you!

However, was Su Yu drawing power from my world just to brainwash... cough, educate the Martial Emperor?

The Human Emperor wouldn't admit to brainwashing.

This is called education!

The Martial Emperor, this barbarian, doesn't understand etiquette. Educating him a bit isn't bad. His path's power won't make people lose their nature. Their original personality remains, but when they see their own people, see the human race, they'll feel a bit more responsible.

They'll feel, I need to save everyone.

Hmm... this isn't brainwashing, this is education.

"Drawing power from my world... this guy, he really did it... I hope he doesn't draw too much, otherwise, the successor won't be able to inherit the first-rank power!"

Thinking this, he couldn't help but want to curse.

This Su Yu, really excessive, doesn't even ask me, just draws power from my world. If I were in my prime, I'd punch you to pieces!

Forget it, I'm old, my temper has improved, and I'm about to die, draw it all, draw it all into your world, it's fine, I can't use it anyway!

...

As for Su Yu, he didn't care about all that.

To be honest, the Human Emperor's world, after so many years, had accumulated a lot of path power, and it was indeed abundant and pure!

At this moment, in the distance, Su Yu's world was expanding.

He had also drawn a lot of power from the Human Emperor's world!

As for the Path of Responsibility, it didn't affect Su Yu much. On one hand, he was strong, and on the other hand, responsibility is something everyone has, just to varying degrees. Su Yu's sense of responsibility towards the human race wasn't weak. The Human Emperor's slight influence was almost negligible.

With a loud rumble, at this moment, the entire Celestial River's mouth was directly blocked by Su Yu!

At this moment, the Human Emperor's world trembled.

The connection with the River of Time was severed. His world was unstable, rapidly showing signs of collapse. From the outside, the previously arch-like river was collapsing!

A large amount of the power of laws was spilling out!

At this moment, Su Yu's world trembled, quickly surrounding the Human Emperor's world, compressing it. The radiation range of the Dao Source Land was instantly compressed. The originally vast world was, in the blink of an eye, compressed to the size of a small city.

And Su Yu continued to compress!

The Human Emperor's world, after the connection was severed, was very unstable.

At this moment, a force of life and death spread over, and Xingyue's voice echoed, "My brother asks if you're crazy? Why are you acting crazy for no reason? He tells you to stop messing around!"

"Don't bother with him, you come back immediately, don't let it spread and affect the flow of time!"

Alright, Xingyue finished delivering the message and quickly disappeared.

And Su Yu continued to compress the Human Emperor's world until it was only the size of a small town, unable to compress any further. Only then did Su Yu stop.

Soon, Su Yu emerged from the path.

Looking again, between the heavens and the earth, the Human Emperor's world was heavily suppressed by his own world, occupying a very small area.

Su Yu chuckled!

This is not bad!

However, the inherent power was still very strong, which was not good!

"Keep drawing!"

His world quickly drew power from the Human Emperor's world.

And the Human Emperor's world lacked some foundational items. At this moment, Su Yu suddenly took out an item, the cover of the Mark of Civilization, which was also the Human Emperor's path diagram!

Su Yu exhaled, returning the item to its rightful owner!

"Merge!"

With a low shout, a page floated out, instantly merging into the world. The path diagram was restored, instantly stabilizing the Human Emperor's world.

But this wasn't enough!

At this moment, Su Yu shouted, "Monitor Heaven!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis instantly appeared, his aura not weak. Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Draw one-fifth of my world's fortune and merge it here!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis's face changed slightly.

In the distance, the Great Zhou King also changed slightly. What was Su Yu doing?

Su Yu said calmly, "Quickly!"

His fortune was extremely prosperous!

But actually, much of it was inherited from ancient times, including the Heaven Monitoring Marquis's initial integration. He had actually seized a lot of ancient fortune. Otherwise, the Human Emperor wouldn't have been so unlucky.

However, in the previous battle, the Human Emperor was indeed quite unlucky. If his fortune had been prosperous, his body might not have been completely destroyed.

Seizing ancient fortune, this point, Su Yu hadn't cared about before.

Now, he vaguely understood a bit. That was because the Human Emperor allowed him to seize ancient fortune. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to take it so easily.

However, now the Human Emperor's fortune was not good. If this continued, he would eventually be unlucky, maybe even die.

Su Yu didn't give much, just one-fifth!

His fortune was extremely prosperous, with contributions from the Giant Race, his own, ancient times, modern humans, and those strong supporters of his. Even the fortune of the myriad races had been taken by him. Every great victory was a fortune plunder.

Even one-fifth was not a small amount.

At this moment, the Heaven Monitoring Marquis's aura was actually very strong.

Vaguely, he seemed to be reaching the second rank. He was the gathering of Su Yu's world's fortune. The stronger the fortune, the stronger he became.

Hearing Su Yu say he wanted to share the fortune, he said in a low voice, "Your Majesty, this..."

Su Yu said coldly, "Quickly, I am the master of the world, you... just follow orders!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis sighed, said no more, and quickly stripped away a portion of the fortune. At this moment, that fortune, like a golden dragon, roared and instantly flew towards the Human Emperor's world, merging into it in the blink of an eye!

At this moment, the Human Emperor's world shook, and the previously unstable world power quickly solidified.

A fortune dragon roared in his world.

Su Yu watched coldly. Soon, he raised an eyebrow slightly. Instantly, the power of the world spread out, and the Xingyue phantom, which had just left, reappeared, looking confused, "What?"

You let me go, and now you're calling me back?

"Tell the Human Emperor to throw out his Human Lord Seal, including the Xingyu Imprint, quickly!"

"For what?"

"Why bother with all that... Fine, I need a stool. Can I use this thing as a stool?" 

Xingyue was speechless! 

She knew Su Yu had his reasons, but she didn't press further and quickly vanished.

...

At the gathering place.

As soon as Xingyue finished speaking, the Human Emperor frowned! 

He vaguely understood what Su Yu was up to! 

Frowning, he said, "This guy, he's being reckless..."

Xingyue, merely the messenger, couldn't help but retort when she saw her brother's anger, "Why don't you just give it to him? You don't need it anymore, and it's not like you can use it now. Didn't you want him to be the next Human Emperor? Then give him the seal. Why are you holding onto it?"

"......"

The Human Emperor was so angry that his nose was almost crooked! 

Nonsense! 

And what do you mean I'm holding onto it? 

It's mine to begin with, alright? What do you know? 

He immediately said, "You don't understand..."

Xingyue nonchalantly replied, "It doesn't matter if I don't understand, as long as Su Yu does. Can't you just give it to him?"

I'm so exhausted!

The Human Emperor felt like crying! 

Are you still my sister? 

Whose side are you on?

"It's not that, he's trying to..."

"He's not a bad person!"

Xingyue snapped, "Brother, does losing this affect you?"

"......"

It seemed not.

The Human Emperor couldn't even say it, and seeing this, Xingyue continued, "See, it doesn't affect you, yet you still don't want to give it. Brother, are you reluctant to give up power? You've gotten used to being the Human Emperor, and now that it's time to transfer power, you're unwilling?"

"......"

The Human Emperor felt like he might as well just kill her!

"Brother, hurry up! A moment here is a long time over there!"

"......"

I'm too tired, I can't take it anymore, I want to die.

Forced by Xingyue's urging, the Human Emperor had no choice but to grit his teeth and throw the two seals into the river. The seals flowed downstream along Su Yu's power of the world.

The Human Emperor couldn't help but curse, "He's simply messing around!"

"He's saving you, and you don't even know how to be grateful!"

Xingyue muttered. She wasn't stupid; having visited twice before and seen Su Yu's world firsthand, she knew Su Yu was probably trying to save her brother. That's why she quickly provoked her brother to hand over the seals!

Su Yu was saving her brother!

The Human Emperor's expression changed slightly as he looked at Xingyue, "You figured it out?"

Somewhat surprised!

Xingyue looked displeased. Of course, I'm not an idiot. Besides, Su Yu never does anything without a reason. Considering my brother's attitude and standing in Su Yu's shoes, it wasn't hard to guess, was it?

Is it that difficult?

Speechless!

Is my brother looking down on me?

Xingyue's expression was displeased, "Is it strange that I figured it out? With such simple things, does my brother think I can't see through them? My brother never trusts me. I said before that my subordinates would come to save you, and you didn't believe me. Do you believe it now?"

"......"

The Human Emperor was speechless. Hearing this, it was truly saddening!

He was pondering when suddenly his expression changed.

...

At the same time, Su Yu's world trembled as he extracted the two seals from the long river.

Not bothering to look at the Great Zhou King's egg-like mouth, Su Yu roared and punched out. The power of countless laws shook, instantly shattering the Xingyu Imprint. A torrent of power surged out, flooding into the Human Emperor's world, stabilizing it.

The Human Emperor's seal also fell into his world, and Su Yu's myriad paths spread out, beginning to organize the internal paths of the Human Emperor's Great Dao.

He intended to use the Human Emperor's seal as the foundation of the Human Emperor's world!

This would make the entire world similar to his own, with something to stabilize it, avoiding the previous reliance on the River of Time.

This way, the expansion of the Human Emperor's world would slow down, but it would be extremely suitable for the current Human Emperor.

Su Yu had already calculated for the Human Emperor. Just integrate into your own world, then sever the Human Emperor's Great Dao and integrate it into the world. Expand your world, and the new Human Emperor's world will be much more suitable for you than before.

As for whether the Human Emperor agreed... What does that have to do with me!

I've arranged it for you. If you don't agree, your Human Emperor's seal and Xingyu Imprint are all wasted, and your world has been extracted from the River of Time.

You figure it out yourself!

The Human Emperor is an honest man, and honest men should honestly wait for arrangements.

At this moment, the Human Emperor's world quickly began to stabilize.

The Human Emperor's seal, immensely powerful, could suppress the entire world, even more stable than Su Yu's world.

Because the Human Emperor's world was not strong at this moment, such a powerful seal was more than enough to suppress it!

Moreover, the Human Emperor's world didn't have many Great Daos. Su Yu had gathered thousands of Great Daos to complete his world, but he also discovered that the Human Emperor's world only had a few hundred Great Daos.

"So... the Human Emperor only comprehended a few hundred Great Daos... Trash!"

Su Yu chuckled, his voice not small, and the Great Zhou King heard it, feeling speechless!

Are you addicted to humiliating the Human Emperor?

Su Yu laughed heartily, feeling very pleased.

You don't understand!

The Human Emperor previously said that his world was also perfect, but he didn't want to take risks... Come on, just admit your talent isn't as good as mine. Although I took advantage of the Time Sage, I have some insight into all the Great Daos.

But the Human Emperor, after so many years, only studied a few hundred Great Daos. Truly ignorant!

The number of Great Daos mastered and comprehended, in Su Yu's view, was a matter of how much one had read.

Apparently, the Human Emperor hadn't read much!

And I, with a Book of Time, it's like having read ten thousand books.

After chuckling for a while, Su Yu quickly linked the Human Emperor's world with the entire seal. The void trembled, the world stabilized, and a seal was hidden within the world!

Su Yu's power of the world also quickly withdrew.

In the blink of an eye, the previously powerful Human Emperor's Great Dao weakened by at least fifty percent!

However, it became more stable!

And the Dao Source Land in the Upper Realm disappeared this time!

The barriers of the Dao Source Land also dissipated.

Soon, only a small black land the size of a village remained!

The Great Zhou King finally understood the situation, his expression changing, "Your Majesty, you... compressed the Human Emperor's world to this extent?"

"Is there anything wrong with that?"

Su Yu smiled, "This suits his current strength. If it's too strong, he'll collapse himself! Alright, that's about it. I consider this saving the Human Emperor's life. When the Human Emperor returns, integrates into the world, and severs his Human Emperor's Dao to integrate it... I think there's a high chance he can maintain a second-class peak, or barely first-class level, which is actually not bad!"

He's not dead!

There's a high chance he can recover to first-class. What's there to be dissatisfied with?

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, quickly nodding, "Perhaps Your Majesty is right. Living is hope! The Human Emperor is talented, and with experience, just lacking the accumulation of power, I believe he can quickly return to his peak!"

Su Yu shrugged, I don't know about that, it's up to the Human Emperor himself.

Anyway, I've made the decision for the Human Emperor. What he does next is his own business.

"Xingyue!"

Su Yu summoned again, and Xingyue appeared once more, unable to help but say, "Didn't you say not to disturb the flow of time?"

"Mm, I won't summon again next time. Just tell the Human Emperor to come back soon, integrate into the world, and recover a bit, lest he dies immediately. That's it!"

"Can my brother be saved?"

"It was never a big deal!"

Su Yu was indifferent, "He was just overthinking it!"

Su Yu didn't agree with the Human Emperor's thoughts.

Now, it's fine.

Maybe, losing one first-class, or even two, so what?

What's so special about first-class?

I naturally have ways to deal with it. Solutions are made by people. As long as you, the Human Emperor, are alive, that's all that matters!

At this moment, Su Yu was in a great mood.

Returning to the Myriad Realms, on the first day, he did something big, saving the Human Emperor's life!

"Go back and tell the Human Emperor, I saved his life. This is the second time. He owes me two lives. Without my permission, he's not allowed to die. That's it!"

Two lives?

Xingyue was puzzled, really?

Alright, I'm just the messenger!

...

"Screw him!"

At this moment, the Human Emperor cursed!

He swore!

Who owes you two lives?

You, Su Yu, really know how to keep accounts!

At this moment, he was very sad. Can't I even die?

You made the decision for me... What are you doing!

I've lost two first-class!

Otherwise, I could definitely create two first-class realms. Now, all ruined by this kid!

Of course, he could still persist now, ignoring Su Yu, continuing to give away the Human Emperor's Great Dao, but... forget it, one first-class might not even compare to myself!

The Human Emperor sighed deeply, suddenly smiling, chuckling, "Forget it, this kid has some self-awareness! He knows, without me, he can't handle it!"

Thinking from another angle, his mood improved instantly.

Su Yu, this brat, scared, right?

Afraid I'll die, right?

If I die, you can't handle it, right?

Indeed, I, Xingyu, am the only one in the heavens, the most important person. Who isn't afraid of my death?

Look, Old Wen was afraid I'd die back then. Every time there was a big battle, he was anxious, "Big brother, you stay back, I'll go!"

See, now it's you, Su Yu, the same. My importance is greater than anyone's!

Xingyue was speechless, "Brother, he told you to go back soon and integrate into the world!"

"What's the rush!"

The Human Emperor didn't argue with Su Yu, nor with his sister, "Why leave now? The Myriad Races are still here, wait until he comes back!"

He dismissed his sister.

The Human Emperor first comforted himself for a while, then sighed again.

Reckless!

Even if I integrate into the world, trying to recover again is still extremely difficult, and now... what's lacking is time, and you know that!

Otherwise, why would I rely on others?

Because you rose too late!

If it were decades or a hundred years earlier, I wouldn't need your help. I could make my own decisions.

"Born too late!"
