Chapter 682: Old Wan Opens the Path (Ten Thousand Words, Please Subscribe)

Old Wan had arrived.

He came openly and without hesitation.

Even though there were still some Eternals present, he came openly because Su Yu had already stepped out, standing atop the Eastern Rift Valley, waiting for Old Wan.

With this, Wan Tiansheng, who had been hiding in the void, had no choice but to reveal himself.

Otherwise, it would seem too sneaky!

"Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

Seeing many people looking over, Wan Tiansheng gave Su Yu ample face.

Su Yu, from a distance, smiled and said, "Welcome back, Principal Wan! Student Su Yu apologizes for not being able to greet you personally."

"......"

Old Wan was surprised. What was this guy up to?

Even though he believed he hadn't done anything wrong by killing, his presence still made many uncomfortable.

Su Yu chuckled and said, "The Human Race is in peril, beset by internal and external troubles. With Principal Wan's return, I am overjoyed and wish to establish the Purification Bureau! I would like to invite Principal Wan to serve as the Director and Lantian as the Deputy Director to cleanse the filth within and without! The betrayal of the Four Kings of antiquity and the Control King led to the ancient defeat and the loss of the Human Race's dominance!"

"Then there were the betrayals of the Sea Burning King and the Silk Destroying King, colluding inside and out, hateful and deserving of death!"

"Moreover, during the Ninth Tide, a traitor bewitched the Hundred Battle King, leading to a great defeat for the Human Race, with over a hundred Daofuse experts perishing, shaming the nation, and nearly causing its extinction. The traitor has yet to be eradicated and must be killed!"

"Furthermore, Marquis Minshan of the Upper Realm died at the hands of traitors, which is detestable! The Human Race in the Upper Realm is in decline, with less than one in ten Daofuse experts remaining, yet there are still traitors among them. The old generation of strong warriors, loyal and patriotic, fighting for the race, died at the hands of vile characters!"

"The surviving traitors are hidden among the few remaining elders, making it difficult to kill them without causing unrest. Only Principal Wan can handle such a task!"

At this moment, silence reigned in all directions.

The millions of soldiers who hadn't gone to war heard everything clearly.

Each was shocked beyond words.

What was going on?

Traitors?

What did that mean?

In the distance, Xia Longwu's eyes flickered as he loudly asked, "Emperor Yu, are you saying Marquis Minshan died at the hands of traitors?"

Su Yu calmly replied, "I have received reliable information that Marquis Minshan was betrayed and killed by various races! Not only that, but during the last tide, the Hundred Battle King could have won, but due to traitors, he suffered a great defeat, nearly leading to the extinction of the Human Race!"

"The traitors are still alive, hiding in the Upper Realm! The Great Zhou King advised me not to publicize this, fearing it would unsettle the people!"

"No, I must speak out. I must warn everyone to be cautious, to be vigilant! The Upper Realm will open soon. If people are unaware and fall into the traitors' traps, dying at their hands, how can I be at peace?"

Su Yu sighed, "Even if it unsettles the people and the army, I must speak out! Most traitors come from the Control King's lineage. The Control King colluded with the ancient emperor of the Devil Race, giving birth to a bloodline. This lineage's heart lies with the Devil Race, and the Silk Destroying King is part of this lineage!"

"The father of the Silk Destroying King, even hundreds of years ago, sought to exterminate the Human Race, discovered by Principal Xia Chen, who used his unparalleled strength to kill him, perishing together! Principal Xia Chen was a descendant of the Battle King, responsible for passing on the torch of civilization. The relics obtained by today's Eternals and the founders of academies were all passed down by Principal Xia Chen!"

Su Yu loudly declared, "Principal Xia Chen was the torchbearer of this tide, yet he died at the hands of such scum!"

"The mother of the Silk Destroying King, a descendant of the Control King, was the sister of the Silk Destroying King's father. This lineage is devoid of humanity, continuously mixing blood, secretly giving birth to the Silk Destroying King. She is now hiding somewhere in the Myriad Realms, possibly in the Devil Realm! This woman possesses unparalleled strength, with the power of Daofuse, secretly killing countless strong warriors of our race, hateful and deserving of death..."

Su Yu listed the crimes one by one.

The soldiers and strong warriors listening were either furious or cursing!

Despicable!

Deserving of death!

Xia Longwu's eyes flickered again as he asked, "And the matter of the Hundred Battle King..."

"The Hundred Battle King's last battle was sabotaged by the Control King's lineage, suppressed somewhere, unable to return, cutting off everyone's path, preventing them from achieving Daofuse! I do not blame the Hundred Battle King, but those traitors... deserve death!"

Su Yu loudly declared, "The Hundred Battle King trusted traitors too much, handing over power to them, leading to the betrayal of allies and the destruction of dozens of allied races, with dozens of Daofuse experts killed!"

"The Hundred Battle King was simple, brave, kind, and gentle-hearted, too kind-hearted, immensely powerful, yet unwilling to kill anyone, only wishing for peace and unity... he is a model for us, but too easily trusts others."

"......"

At this moment, some Eternals had strange expressions.

The soldiers and generals below were all grimacing.

Those with fiery tempers and coarse language couldn't help but mutter, "The Hundred Battle King, wasn't he the Human Lord of the last tide? I've heard about him, kind, gentle... Emperor Yu even calls him a model, is he an idiot?"

"He got over a hundred Daofuse experts killed, did our Human Race even have that many Daofuse experts before?"

"Damn, this idiot could be the Human Lord?"

"I heard he had a lot of strong supporters, all those Upper Realm experts."

"Upper Realm experts are idiots too, huh?"

"Didn't Emperor Yu say? There are many traitors up there!"

"Damn, no wonder our Human Race was the ancient overlord, now it's so difficult, turns out the last tide got over a hundred Daofuse experts killed, this... really speechless!"

"......"

The discussions continued.

Behind Su Yu, the Great Zhou King's face turned pale as he looked at Su Yu, at this moment, rarely showing a pleading expression, transmitting his voice, "Emperor Yu, this... once the Hundred Battle King's reputation spreads, then... then he will be the sinner of the Human Race... he..."

"Isn't he?"

Su Yu also transmitted his voice, calmly saying, "He is! I'm just reminding everyone to be careful, not to be foolish! Traitors definitely exist! The mother of the Silk Destroying King, a Heavenly King-level expert, has already been captured by me! There are still people from this lineage in the Upper Realm!"

"I don't want to repeat the same mistakes, I want to announce to the world, there are many traitors in the Upper Realm, that is a fact!"

"I also want to announce to the world, the Hundred Battle King was set up, I didn't say he was a traitor, that's giving him face, giving him dignity! He buried the foundation of the Human Race for ten thousand years, have I slandered him even once?"

Su Yu coldly said, "Don't think I don't know, he's still alive! You even know he's alive! Zhou Tianqi, don't think I'm an idiot! You pushed me to the throne just to get through the current crisis, once the Hundred Battle King returns, you'll take your people and help him reclaim the position of Human Lord, do you really think I don't understand?"

Su Yu was extremely cold, staring at him, making the Great Zhou King's heart grow cold.

Su Yu sneered, "Now try it! I've given him face, and I've given you all face! Maybe the Hundred Battle King has already appeared, maybe he's been waiting, even waiting for me to lay this foundation, and then come to take advantage!"

"I don't mind using the worst intentions to guess you people!"

"But... am I really that foolish?"

Su Yu sneered, loudly declaring, "There are too many traitors, the Hundred Battle King is immensely powerful, surpassing the Celestial Tiangu, the Devil Race's Demon Halberd, the God Race's Jiwu, able to kill ten or a hundred Daofuse experts alone, yet still defeated, with a hundred Daofuse experts of the Human Race perishing, while the Myriad Races suffered less than thirty deaths... it's tragic and lamentable!"

Su Yu sighed, "The Hundred Battle King is about to return, I hope he can realize where he went wrong, not to repeat the same mistakes, if he can understand everything, with his strength, I will step down and assist him in unifying the heavens! I only hope, not to bury the foundation of the Human Race for hundreds of thousands of years again!"

As soon as these words were spoken, over there, Xia Longwu coldly said, "Impossible! How can Emperor Yu do such a thing? The Hundred Battle King is poor at recognizing people, indecisive, no matter how strong, he's just a brute! A brute isn't even qualified, a brute can at least kill some strong enemies! Our Human Race, in this tide, has risen from weakness, step by step to today, all by defeating the strong with the weak, winning every battle! Yet in the last tide, with overwhelming strength, we were defeated to the point of national extinction! In the last tide, a hundred Daofuse experts were defeated, in this tide, the Human Race has only one Daofuse expert, do we want the Hundred Battle King to lead us to death? I do not agree!"

Over there, many Eternals simultaneously shouted, "Impossible, General Xia's meaning is our meaning! Emperor Yu has won every battle, the allied forces rely entirely on Emperor Yu's protection, if the Hundred Battle King returns to ascend as Human Lord, how can the dozens of extinct ancient races from the last tide let the Iron Devourer Races rest easy?"

"The various races assist the Human Race because of Emperor Yu's name, not the Hundred Battle King's name, the Hundred Battle King trusted treacherous people, if he replaces Emperor Yu, the allied forces will collapse!"

"......"

A group of Eternals, including those from the Zhu family, Nan Wujian, and other strong figures from various prefectures.

Everyone was not foolish.

Some things were secrets among the high ranks, now made public by Su Yu, they understood what Su Yu wanted, and they knew.

At this moment, the news had already spread among the millions of soldiers, and the next moment, among the million soldiers, someone shouted, "We only respect Emperor Yu! The people's hearts are with him, even if the Hundred Battle King returns, we only respect Emperor Yu!"

"What we want is an Emperor Yu who can win battles, not a powerful Hundred Battle King who buries the foundation of the Human Race!"

"......"

The shouts continued!

No way!

How could it be!

The Hundred Battle King, actually the lower ranks were not familiar with him, but they only knew one thing, with absolute advantage, he got over a hundred Daofuse experts killed, Daofuse!

Now everyone knows what Daofuse is, it's a semi-emperor!

The Human Race, in the last tide change, actually had a hundred semi-emperors!

My heavens!

Some people wanted to cry, so strong, how did they lose?

The Hundred Battle King!

It was him!

A waste!

Emperor Yu even said he was immensely powerful, able to kill Tiangu and the others, then why didn't he kill them?

Not only that, from the sound of it, the Human Race not producing Daofuse experts seems to be related to the Hundred Battle King, is it that he's not dead, yet he's blocking everyone from progressing?

Is that what it means?

Then it would be better if he just died!

......

Opposite Su Yu, Wan Tiansheng's eyes were strange.

Looking at Su Yu, looking at the Great Zhou King.

He understood!

Why Su Yu came to greet him.

Good kid, ruthless enough.

Since there are still those waiting for your return, I shall sever your path back, ensuring that your name becomes infamous!

The Purification Bureau!

These thoughts swirled in Wan Tiansheng's mind as Su Yu spoke aloud, "Principal Wan, you are fair and just, strict with yourself, and dedicated solely to the Human Race, disregarding any slander. You are a model for the world! Therefore, I, student Su Yu, hope that Principal Wan will take charge of the Purification Bureau, to cleanse the impurities for our Human Race! To contribute to the rise of our people! To guard against the infiltration of the Control King and Demon Emperor's bloodlines into our upper echelons!"

Wan Tiansheng's thoughts raced, and he quickly responded in a loud voice, "Wan Tiansheng accepts the order. Emperor Yu, your praise is too high! I, Wan, will not allow any vile beings to infiltrate our Human Race!"

"Excellent!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, reaching out as the Human Lord Seal descended from the sky, gathering the clouds into a book.

Su Yu took up the pen and wrote the appointment letter, and the next moment, the Human Lord Seal fell!

Boom!

A surge of fortune descended upon Wan Tiansheng, causing the Human Realm to tremble.

Wan Tiansheng's shadow appeared in the sky above the Human Realm, the first Eternal to receive such treatment. Su Yu wanted everyone to know that this was his personal appointment.

He is not a human demon!

Wan Tiansheng is a human saint!

An enforcer of the heavens!

Beside him, the Great Zhou King closed his eyes momentarily, returning to calm without speaking further.

All around, the powerful figures fell silent.

Su Yu chuckled, the golden book falling into Wan Tiansheng's hands. The next moment, Su Yu laughed aloud, "Principal Wan's strength is comparable to the sixth stage of the Eternal Realm, but it's still too weak to suppress rebellion. I grant the Principal an opportunity, to accompany me on a journey through the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth!"

With a stroke of his pen, he tore through the void. Su Yu ascended into the air, disappearing from sight, and Wan Tiansheng's eyes flickered as he quickly vanished as well.

...

In the River of Time, Wan Tiansheng chuckled bitterly, "Aren't you afraid these guys will embarrass you on the spot?"

Su Yu was indifferent, "Principal, what is there to fear? Let me put it this way, don't push me. If pushed, I'll clear out all who don't listen! I can now summon dozens of Daofuse Realm combatants at any time. I don't lack a few Eternals, nor do I lack a Daofuse!"

"What?"

Wan Tiansheng looked surprised, and Su Yu laughed, "Including Hongmeng, there are 11 Daofuse! The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King have both reached Daofuse! In the Death Realm, I have dozens of Daofuse under my command... Principal, tell me, do I need to be polite with them?"

Wan Tiansheng took a deep breath.

After a long pause, he could only utter, "Damn!"

No wonder this kid is so arrogant. He was somewhat amused, "How... how did you manage this?"

"Genius is like this!"

Su Yu laughed cheerfully, and Wan Tiansheng was also amused, "Nonsense!"

"Principal doesn't believe it?"

Su Yu smiled, "Forget it, let's not talk about this. Principal, listen to me explain the essence of the Great Dao. It's a simple thing, fools can't understand it, but I believe the Principal will!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded solemnly, remaining silent.

Su Yu quickly explained the River of Time, the tributaries, the Great Dao, the Dao of the Flesh, the Three Body Method, the rules, the Weapon Fusion Method, and everything else...

Wan Tiansheng listened, entranced!

This was the first time someone had explained the Great Dao and the rules so clearly. When Liu Hong had said that divine characters were the embryonic form of rules, he had gained much insight. Today, he finally understood what the Great Dao truly was!

"So that's how it is!"

Wan Tiansheng murmured, "So, I... might have opened a tributary myself! Or I sensed the existence of other Great Daos, but I didn't know how to fuse them, so I didn't merge with the Dao. In fact, I no longer walk the Dao of the Flesh, so the so-called proving the Dao is useless to me!"

Su Yu nodded.

After some thought, he gritted his teeth and said, "Principal, I can attach some Heaven Gate power to you, but you can only see some lines, it's not very useful! If you're bold enough, let your will sea enter my Heaven Gate, merge with my Heaven Gate, and I'll let you see what a true Great Dao is!"

"......"

Wan Tiansheng took a deep breath, "Are you crazy?"

Then he added, "Aren't you afraid I'll get you killed?"

Su Yu said helplessly, "What am I afraid of? Principal, don't you think I know by now? Back then, you left a will clone in my heart. You've spied on ninety percent of my secrets! No, you probably know everything except the Book of Time, no, you might even know about the Book of Time!"

Wan Tiansheng's expression changed, and he quickly coughed, "That's not true, how could it be? I didn't do such things! I'm not like Lantian, who likes to spy on people!"

Su Yu sneered, "Grandstar, Heavendoom, and even Senior Hongmeng have all said they've seen you! I asked, and they all saw you when I went to several cities! Still pretending!"

"Mistaken identity!"

Wan Tiansheng firmly denied it!

He didn't do it!

Su Yu sneered again, "Principal, if it wasn't you, was it me? Come on! Still denying it! I'm not interested in women, so I won't hold it against you..."

Wan Tiansheng coughed again, "Even if you were interested in women, I wouldn't look at those things, don't worry!"

Su Yu stared at him for a while, and Wan Tiansheng awkwardly explained, "Didn't I say the first time we met? Above the Shanhai Realm, I couldn't deal with you. I was fulfilling my promise to protect you! Later, seeing you in danger, I didn't retrieve that will clone. It eventually dissipated on its own, and I didn't see anything it recorded!"

He continued, "Really, I didn't see anything. Even if you hid women outside, I wouldn't know!"

Su Yu was speechless, pretending!

Forget it!

I don't believe you know nothing.

Forget it, I won't argue with you. Anyway, there's nothing shameful, and the most important Book of Time isn't really a secret to some people now.

Wan Tiansheng also laughed dryly.

Some things are better left unsaid.

I didn't put a little person in your heart to spy on you, it was to protect you, understand?

Wan Tiansheng quickly changed the topic, asking, "Can the Heaven Gate merge with my willpower?"

"Give it a try!"

Su Yu wasn't sure, "To put it simply, you'll have a deeper understanding of the Great Dao! Seeing it yourself is stronger than me explaining it! The Principal has saved me several times, Senior Hongmeng said that the first time he saw me, he almost killed me because I was converting death energy, and he thought I was a necromancer! The Principal personally explained, so he didn't pursue it!"

Wan Tiansheng's little person actually helped Su Yu several times, Su Yu just didn't know it at the time.

Later, both Grandstar and Heavendoom mentioned it.

The first time he converted death energy in the Sea of Stars, Old Turtle almost killed him. Death energy is something that must be eliminated for the guardians!

If he had really been killed then, it would have been another story!

Old Turtle told it as a joke, but Su Yu was terrified.

He almost died!

How terrifying!

Wan Tiansheng pondered for a while, then said, "We can try, but it won't destroy your Heaven Gate, right?"

"Not to that extent!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Heaven Gate is composed of 720 apertures, even if it's gone, it can be reconstructed!"

"Then... let me see what path I'm on!"

No one is not curious about this, and Wan Tiansheng was curious, and Su Yu was actually curious too.

What path is Wan Tiansheng on?

Lantian, needless to say, must be related to clones, but Su Yu really didn't know about Wan Tiansheng.

What makes Wan Tiansheng strong?

His control!

He was very powerful when traversing the River of Time, even traversing others' past and future. Now that I think about it, he probably traversed to the front of others' Great Dao, cutting off their Great Dao power.

What path did Old Wan take?

Did he open his own path, or did he merge with an incredible Great Dao?

The next moment, Su Yu's Heaven Gate flew out, and Old Wan didn't say much, tapping his forehead, and a divine character flew out.

Su Yu's civilization divine character was actually learned from Wan Tiansheng.

Obviously, Old Wan's divine character wasn't weak either.

A divine character, Su Yu suspected it was a composite, but he wasn't sure.

The next moment, the divine character flew into the Heaven Gate, instantly merging with it.

Su Yu's physical body trembled, suppressing the repulsion!

And Wan Tiansheng also let out a low shout, a third eye suddenly grew on his forehead, like a small Heaven Gate, panting, "I'll open a fake Heaven Gate myself to take a look first!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "What the hell?"

"Copy divine character!"

"Hmm?"

Wan Tiansheng explained, "It's used to copy treasures! Copy rules, copy Great Dao, copy everything, I'll copy a small Heaven Gate to play with first."

"This... is that possible?"

Su Yu was stunned, is this possible?

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "It's a small trick! Copying this thing isn't very useful! For example, I can only copy some weak things. If you say a Daofuse stands in front of me for me to copy, I can't copy it! These are some basic methods of a civilization master, not very useful."

Su Yu, however, grinned, it's very useful!

"How is it not useful? This is very powerful, copying Great Dao, this..."

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Then you can outline it yourself, you can also outline it! Don't disturb me, let me see..."

He looked towards the vicinity of the River of Time, and at this moment, vaguely saw something, and was also shocked, "So, in your eyes, the Great Dao is like this! The tributaries of the Great Dao, the River of Time, this Great Dao contains the power of rules, they're all different!"

He couldn't see very clearly, but he could see, and as he watched, he had some insights, quickly saying, "Let's go, I have some feelings, my path is not here, let's go forward!"

Both were powerful, quickly flying forward.

They flew past the Human Race's Dao of the Flesh, waves surging, Wan Tiansheng didn't care, he could already roam the River of Time before, even taking Su Yu with him, it was just that neither of them could see those tributaries of the Great Dao before.

And Su Yu, this time roaming the River of Time with Wan Tiansheng, saw something different.

He found that when Wan Tiansheng roamed the River of Time, a force would be born on his body, offsetting the invasion of the river's power, so he could go further.

Wan Tiansheng himself sensed something and, seeing Su Yu's gaze, explained, "This should be related to a character I have mastered, one that represents 'unload'—unloading the power of all things! I hadn't paid much attention before, but now it seems quite effective! According to the principle that characters correspond to laws, this character should also correspond to a certain path..."

Su Yu nodded.

Wan Tiansheng smiled again, "This isn't my main path. It's still ahead. I have some sense of it!"

The two continued forward, crossing numerous tributaries of the great paths. Su Yu suspected they might even reach his pen dao soon. Was Wan Tiansheng's path really still ahead?

Wan Tiansheng didn't dwell on it, continuing forward as he spoke, "In the past, I actually had some sense of it! According to your current explanation, I might have had the hope of merging or opening a path before, but I was never able to complete it. It didn't feel quite right, you know?"

Su Yu asked curiously, "Not quite right?"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "Yes, not quite right! You see, if I hadn't sensed anything from the start, that would be one thing. But actually, when Liu Hong mentioned that characters correspond to laws, I sensed a lot. I felt that my characters had the power to open a path! You must understand, my characters now far exceed the power of a typical sixth-stage Eternal, yet I still can't open a path. I refuse to believe that in the ancient times, humans at the sixth stage of Eternity couldn't even open a small path."

"Last time, didn't I go to the Spirit Race? I stole their supreme treasure, the Hundred Spirit Fruit, which is the fruit of a Daofuse expert, containing a massive amount of the power of laws. I consumed it, and while my characters grew stronger, I still couldn't open or merge a path!"

Wan Tiansheng explained, "Every time I wander the River of Time, I reach a certain point and get stuck, unable to move forward! I thought the River of Time had an end, and I had reached it. I always felt the River of Time was only so long..."

Su Yu was increasingly intrigued.

"The prefect has traveled really far!" Su Yu said awkwardly.

Wan Tiansheng didn't mind, smiling, "It's alright. It seems my characters have a high compatibility with the River of Time, allowing me to resist some pressure. Yes, a bit further, and I can't proceed anymore!"

Su Yu nodded awkwardly, "Yes, the prefect has traveled exceptionally far. This talent... truly impressive!"

"Not as far as you, but there seems to be an end over there..."

Wan Tiansheng mused, "Maybe I need to go the other way? Who knows, let's go and see!"

The two continued forward, traveling a great distance. Wan Tiansheng stopped, hesitating, "No, there's still a path ahead. I seem to be unable to proceed around here, but I feel my path is still ahead..."

Su Yu chuckled awkwardly, "Well..."

"This time, I'll try. I can see it; there's still a path ahead!"

Wan Tiansheng suddenly charged forward. With a loud crash, chains appeared in the void, and with another crash, Wan Tiansheng was sent flying back, clutching his head in pain, "Yes, it's the same situation again! I couldn't see it before, but now I can. Damn it! Who set up these chains to block the way? No wonder I always got bounced back here. I thought it was the end of the River of Time! Turns out someone blocked my path!"

His expression turned serious, "I understand now!"

"What?"

Su Yu asked awkwardly.

Wan Tiansheng said gravely, "An enemy! I understand now, an ancient enemy, an enemy of the human race, a tremendously powerful existence! They set up a barrier here, preventing our human geniuses from merging or opening paths, from creating their own paths! Such a vicious mind, could it be... the Control King?"

His expression changed, "Yes, he's skilled in the way of sealing! So that's it! The Control King is simply a beast, cutting off our human race's path forward..."

Su Yu chuckled awkwardly, "It can't be! This is already very far. Normally, people can't reach this far! Besides, on our way here, there were hundreds of paths, all of them paths. If they really wanted to block us, they should have set up barriers at the entrance to the Human Realm!"

"You don't understand!"

Wan Tiansheng said heavily, "This is the Control King's brilliance! The further you go, the more open space there is for us to open paths. There are too many paths ahead, no room to open new ones. Even if you open a path, you can't expand it to the size of the physical path! This means that when you reach the level of a master of laws, you can't continue to strengthen yourself. It also means one thing: the Control King isn't afraid of people proving the Dao, isn't afraid of people merging the Dao, isn't afraid of people becoming masters of laws! But he is afraid of someone becoming a powerful master of laws, so he sealed the path ahead, beast!"

"......"

Su Yu was extremely awkward, nodding after a while, "The Control King is truly a beast. Um... prefect, let me clear the way for you!"

"No need, I'll do it myself..."

"No, prefect, let me. I'm good at clearing paths!"

Su Yu chuckled, and a character flew out. In the next moment, the character inserted itself between the chains, and the previously sealed River of Time instantly opened.

Wan Tiansheng was stunned, "What is this thing? So powerful, it just opened it..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Impressive, right? Prefect, keep going, let's move on!"

Wan Tiansheng, with some doubts, had no choice but to follow along, feeling a bit strange. Was it really that easy to unseal?

How odd!

After flying for a while, Wan Tiansheng suddenly gasped, "Look, this path is very powerful. Could it be the Control King's path?"

"......"

Su Yu chuckled, "Probably not, let's keep going..."

Wan Tiansheng suddenly froze, looking at the tributary of the great path, then at Su Yu, recalling the character he had just used, and furrowed his brows slightly. After a while, Wan Tiansheng's eyes nearly bulged out!

"Damn!"

He cursed loudly, "Culture King?"

"......"

"Cough, cough, cough!"

Su Yu coughed, awkwardly saying, "Normally... people can't reach here to open a path, right?"

Yes, Su Yu thought, normally people couldn't reach here to open a path. The Culture King opening a path here meant it was already very deep. Of course, it didn't mean that the deeper the path, the stronger it was. The physical path was opened right at the start, and it was stronger. But... there were countless great paths ahead, and there was open space. Normally, people wouldn't need to fly so far to open a path; it was too distant!

Who would have thought that Wan Tiansheng couldn't merge or open a path because he believed his path was beyond the Culture King's pen dao!

And the Culture King had sealed it!

The Culture King didn't want others entering his path, leaving it for his own successors. As for whether others could pass, that wasn't the Culture King's concern. He hadn't blocked others; true powerhouses could directly open another entrance!

He had only sealed a small section!

Truly top powerhouses, like masters of laws, could completely bypass this section and open another entrance. Clearly, Wan Tiansheng didn't have that capability!

It was only because his path was in this direction, and he had various means, compatible with the River of Time, that he could reach here, and thus... he was blocked!

Not just once!

So, no matter how strong his characters were, he couldn't open or merge a path. No wonder he had reached around the seventh stage of Eternity, yet he couldn't open a path. Su Yu sensed that Wan Tiansheng was stronger than before!

At least he had the power of the seventh stage!

Before this, he was probably around the fifth or sixth stage, progressing quite fast. But the key was, he hadn't merged or opened a path, purely strengthening his characters to this extent.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng was gritting his teeth.

He understood now!

He realized!

"The Culture King... is he trying to cut off my path?"

Su Yu chuckled, "He probably didn't expect it, prefect. You're truly impressive; your path is even deeper than the pen dao?"

Wan Tiansheng was speechless, "So, if no one inherits the pen dao, I can forget about opening a path in my lifetime? Forget about merging a path? I always wondered why I couldn't do it; turns out someone blocked my way!"

"Also, if I couldn't see it, if you hadn't brought me here, would I have had to rely solely on strengthening my characters to grow stronger?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Not necessarily. When the prefect's other characters grow stronger, you can take other paths!"

"Nonsense!"

Wan Tiansheng cursed, "Just for this, I've got a grudge against the Culture King! If not for today, I would never have discovered it in my lifetime!"

He had just seen it and thought it was the Control King's doing.

"The Culture King is not a decent person. How many people's paths has he blocked over these hundred thousand years?"

Su Yu shrugged, "Not necessarily. I think it might just be you! Previously, most humans took the physical path, a small portion took other paths, but they couldn't go this far. Honestly, as talented as I am, it's hard to reach here. I don't think, in the previous nine tides, anyone went further than us?"

"But what if there were?"

Wan Tiansheng was still furious, "What if there were others?"

Su Yu smiled, "If there were, so be it. True geniuses won't be crushed! Just like you, prefect, if you really can't overcome it, in a few more years, when your characters grow stronger, you can directly connect from outside to the area you want to open or merge a path, and you won't need to pass through here! It can only block you for a while, not forever!"

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment, nodded, but still felt indignant, "It delayed me at least 10 years!"

Su Yu smiled, "Hard to say. Without these years of accumulation, the prefect might not have the current insights. If everything went smoothly, it might not be a good thing."

"Do I need your consolation?"

Wan Tiansheng snorted. His mood wasn't great, and he had a grudge against the Culture King now!

Blocking one's path!

It was indeed a great enmity. Of course, Wan Tiansheng didn't say much more at this moment, secretly vowing in his heart, "Culture King, you better be alive. When I can contend with you, we'll see!"

That chain area had indeed blocked him for at least ten years!

Su Yu shrugged, "It's none of my business. Old Wan can deal with the Culture King later!"

If he could really contend with the Culture King... Su Yu knew the Culture King was absurdly strong. Old Wan might never have the chance for revenge.

Crossing the pen dao, both Wan Tiansheng and Su Yu felt immense pressure!

Wan Tiansheng's method of unloading force was also starting to lose its effectiveness.

Su Yu was drenched in sweat, panting heavily. "Principal, are we there yet?"

"Almost..."

"How much further?"

"Almost there!"

The two continued onward, flying for a while longer. Su Yu was still catching his breath, while Wan Tiansheng's face had turned pale, his endurance clearly inferior to Su Yu's.

At that moment, Wan Tiansheng suddenly brightened up, "We're here!"

Su Yu was taken aback, glancing around. There was no tributary in sight! On both sides, the river flowed straight and wide. He furrowed his brows slightly, "Open a path! Principal, it's troublesome to open a path. It means no one has walked this road before. What exactly have you comprehended that others haven't?"

He frowned, "I know opening a path is difficult and progress is slow. One might not even reach a controllable level in a lifetime!"

"It's nothing!" Wan Tiansheng dismissed it casually. "As you said, the stronger the path, the stronger the combat power! Some top-tier Daofuse cultivators of the physical body path can battle the masters of rules! I still have the combat power of an Eternal Seventh Stage. At worst, I won't be any weaker than I am now! Let's just open it. I see no other paths nearby, so it's a good place to open a path!"

"Principal, have you considered finding another path to merge with first?"

"No need to consider!" Wan Tiansheng shook his head, smiling. "My path is unique. I won't consider others! If I can't open my own path, I'd rather continue strengthening my character, strengthening it until it can't be strengthened anymore!"

Alright, Su Yu stopped persuading. He was actually quite curious about Wan Tiansheng's main character or main rule.

Something no one had ever opened before!

"Principal, show me how you open a path. Maybe I'll open one myself in the future and gain some experience!"

"Then watch closely. I have some ideas. I'll transform my character into a path. My main character can transform into a path right here!"

As he spoke, a powerful character flew out!

Su Yu focused his gaze, slightly stunned.

What was that?

It seemed like a little person!

Or rather, a miniature version of Wan Tiansheng. What was that?

Su Yu was bewildered!

Was this a character?

"Principal, let me see your character. What kind of character is it? Why are you making it into a little person?"

Wan Tiansheng replied oddly, "It's not a character turned into a person; it is the character!"

"What do you mean?"

Su Yu looked at the little Wan Tiansheng, confused.

He was genuinely puzzled!

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment and said, "Maybe it can transform into a character, but it actually looks like this. Forget it, I'll transform it into a character for you to see!"

The next moment, the little person suddenly transformed into a character, though Wan Tiansheng had forcibly turned it into a character.

Just like the Culture King's "↑", Wan Tiansheng's character was a little person.

The next moment, the little person transformed into a word—Human!

Wan Tiansheng explained, "It's probably the Human Dao. Essentially, it's me. I am human, my path is human, the Myriad Realms are me, I am this path, and this path is me... Forget it, you're too young to understand my insights!"

Su Yu was dumbfounded, Human Dao!

At that moment, Wan Tiansheng's character crashed into the barrier on one side of the river, creating a depression with a loud bang!

In the river, countless powers of laws were suddenly drawn in!

At this moment, countless Wan Tianshengs appeared, rushing toward the riverbank!

These powers of laws all took human form.

At this moment, countless characters emerged from Wan Tiansheng's body, all transforming into little Wan Tianshengs.

One Wan Tiansheng practiced martial arts, another read books, another ate...

Wan Tiansheng himself was excited, "This is my path unified. Everything about me is me! Reading is me, practicing martial arts is me, eating is me, sleeping is me, everything is me. I am human, they are human too, opening the Human Dao... Opening a path, so this is how it is! It's simple. The reason I chose this place to open a path is, first, it's spacious enough, and second, there are some human Dao rules here, aligning with my path!"

Rumble!

As countless Wan Tianshengs appeared, a small tributary was gradually carved out on one side of the river!

A large amount of river water flowed into the tributary, instantly filling it!

Wan Tiansheng's aura surged instantly!

He had opened a path!

And it was so simple!

In fact, if not for the Culture King's obstruction, he could have opened a path long ago!

Su Yu, however, wore a peculiar expression. Opening a path, was this opening a path?

Countless Wan Tianshengs, everything belonging to Wan Tiansheng, were merging into this path!

Reading, teaching, practicing martial arts, researching, fighting, living, everything was merging, transforming into power, carving out his own path.

Su Yu even saw some strange things!

For instance, a young Wan Tiansheng, admiring a woman, reading a love letter to her.

This was also part of his life experience and insights, merging into the Great Dao, perfecting everything for his path!

Wan Tiansheng remained calm, not even glancing at Su Yu, smiling, "The sophistication of human relationships is an article in itself. Whether it's reading or falling in love, everything in life is a path! Opening a path, I understand now, is about integrating everything you cherish, love, and protect into your path, and then you have your unique Great Dao!"

Su Yu silently absorbed all this.

This was a true powerhouse opening a path on his own, far more sophisticated and complex than the White Dog. The White Dog, in fact, opened a path under the guidance of the Culture King and the Time Sage, somewhat muddled. Its insights might not be deep.

Even if it had insights, it was just one word, bite!

Instinct!

The Culture King and the others transformed the White Dog's instinct into its path, allowing it to open a path, saving a lot of comprehension and trouble.

"Opening a path, life, insights, Human Dao..."

Su Yu silently contemplated. Perhaps one day, he too would open his own path.

What would my path be?

What are my life insights?

Fighting?

Becoming stronger?

Or something else?

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly felt that he wasn't qualified to open a path yet. What he thought was comprehending everything, seeing the essence of all Great Daos, was still lacking.

This Heaven Gate, if it were with Wan Tiansheng, might be more useful!

...

And at the moment this Human Dao was opened.

Human Realm.

Great Xia Prefecture.

Great Xia Cultural Research Academy suddenly experienced a surge in fortune, white light illuminating the heavens and earth, a surge of fortune power appearing out of thin air. In an instant, all the students of the Cultural Research Academy felt a special Dao charm, and many instantly fell into comprehension!

Comprehending characters, comprehending life!

...

On the Allheaven Battlefield, where Su Yu had just disappeared, golden light suddenly shone, and a faint figure seemed to appear, only to vanish quickly.

The Great Zhou King’s face changed, turning to look at the sky above the Human Realm. Earlier, when Su Yu conferred Wan Tiansheng, a shadow of Wan Tiansheng had fallen into the Human Realm. Now, that shadow suddenly reappeared, flashing with golden light!

The Great Zhou King’s expression changed!

What was happening?

...

Luminous Domain Mansion.

The Martial Emperor opened his eyes again, opening a layer of eyes, the Heaven Gate opening, looking into the endless void, frowning. What was happening?

Was someone opening a path?

What path were they opening, causing such a commotion?

In this era, how many people could still open a path?

Su Yu?

Impossible!

That guy wasn't qualified yet, even though he inherited the pen dao, he hadn't comprehended it thoroughly.

The Martial Emperor frowned, unable to see more for the moment.

...

And at this moment, far ahead of Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng, in a very distant place, several enormous Great Daos trembled slightly.

It seemed that at the end of the River of Time, a golden Great Dao appeared, connecting to the main Dao. A shadow seemed to appear, looking downstream of the River of Time, with some surprise and weariness, "In the future... has someone opened a unique path? What path can stir the river... stir the past and future... interesting!"

The shadow looked toward the distant downstream, wondering how far into the future that was.

With a sigh, just opening a path, it seemed not long into the future... there might not be time!

The shadow dissipated!

The Great Daos stopped trembling, calming down.

...

At this moment, Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng were unaware of all this.

The two of them, one engrossed in opening a path, the other engrossed in observing, Su Yu seemed to be observing Wan Tiansheng's entire life, finding it very interesting!

He suddenly grasped a lot of Wan Tiansheng's gossip!

And he couldn't help but admire Wan Tiansheng's knowledge. He discovered that, book by book, Wan Tiansheng had read at least a million books in his lifetime, an incredible feat. Countless Wan Tianshengs, holding book after book, walked toward the Great Dao, continuing to carve out the path!

This was the foundation!

How did he have time to read so many books?

Moreover, if he hadn't comprehended them thoroughly, they probably wouldn't have appeared!

In less than a hundred years, reading from a young age, he had to read ten thousand books a year, thirty books a day. This guy, reading at lightning speed, did he do nothing else?

And Wan Tiansheng, not caring about Su Yu, was now in high spirits, continuously reciting some Great Dao texts. As the Great Dao was carved out, he even stepped across the river, entering his own tributary!

In this world, in the Myriad Realms, Wan Tiansheng was truly a top-tier genius!

Fifty years ago, before he was fifty, he could rival the Eternal!

Back then, it was different from now!

Before fifty, rivaling the Eternal, in the Human Realm... perhaps there hadn't been anyone like him before. In ancient times, Su Yu wasn't sure, but Su Yu himself, if he hadn't inherited some things, would have found it difficult to reach where he was today.

"Strange, could he be a descendant of a powerful figure?"

Su Yu muttered to himself, looking at the Great Dao, which had already been carved out quite long. Wan Tiansheng seemed to be able to continue opening it!

Continuously carving, both in length and width.

Was Wan Tiansheng going to step into Daofuse in a day?

At this moment, his aura, Su Yu felt, should have reached the power of an Eternal Ninth Stage, though the increase wasn't much, given he already had the power of the Seventh Stage before.

It felt like he could truly enter Daofuse!

"Indeed, reading more books is the way to go!"

Su Yu sighed with emotion, suddenly noticing a tiny Wan Tiansheng holding a book as he stepped onto the grand path. Casually glancing over, Su Yu was momentarily stunned. He could actually see the title of the book!

"The Treatise on the Union of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang"!

Su Yu was taken aback and looked toward the real Wan Tiansheng. After a long pause, he raised his middle finger!

Shameless old man!

Reading such a book, how many of the million books he claimed to have read were like this?

Tch!

Su Yu sneered in disdain. Shameless! So that's what he was doing holed up in the Heart Cultivation Pavilion all the time, no wonder he rarely came out!
