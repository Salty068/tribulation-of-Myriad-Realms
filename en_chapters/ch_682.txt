Chapter 682: Wan Tiansheng Opens His Dao

Wan Tiansheng arrived.

He arrived openly and honestly.

Even though there were still some Eternals present, he still arrived openly and honestly, because Su Yu had gone out directly, standing atop the East Rift Valley, waiting for Wan Tiansheng.

As a result, Wan Tiansheng, who had originally vanished into the void, had no choice but to reveal himself.

Otherwise, it would seem too sneaky!

“Greetings, Emperor Yu!”

Seeing many people looking their way, Wan Tiansheng gave him ample face.

Su Yu, from a distance, smiled and said, “Welcome back, Principal Wan! Your student, Su Yu, was unable to personally greet you. My apologies for the oversight!”

“…”

Wan Tiansheng was surprised. What was this guy doing?

He wasn’t exactly well-liked.

Even if he believed his killings were justified, his very existence, to be honest, still made many people resent him.

Su Yu chuckled and spoke, “The Human Race is in dire straits, plagued by internal and external troubles, internal strife, and external unrest! Principal Wan’s return fills my heart with joy, and I wish to establish a Purification Bureau! I’d like to invite the Principal to serve as its Director! And invite Lan Tian to serve as Deputy Director! To cleanse both internal and external impurities! Among the Ancient Four Kings, Control King betrayed the Human Race, leading to the great defeat in ancient times and the loss of humanity’s hegemonic position!”

“Later, Fenhai Wang and Silk Destroying King rebelled, colluding internally and externally. They are hateful and deserve death!”

“Furthermore, in the Ninth Tide, a fiend misled Hundred Battle King, causing a great defeat for the Human Race, with hundreds of Daofuse cultivators dying in battle, disgracing the nation and almost leading to its extinction. That fiend has not been eradicated and must be killed!”

“There’s also Minshan Hou from the Upper Realm, who died at the hands of traitors. How hateful! The Human Race in the Upper Realm is weak, with less than one in ten Daofuse cultivators remaining, yet there are still traitors among them. The older generation of powerhouses, loyal to their ruler and country, fought for their race, but died at the hands of petty villains!”

“The surviving traitors are hidden among those few remaining elders. Killing them is difficult, but not killing them will not appease the people. The difficulty of investigation is immense, and only Principal Wan is capable of handling it!”

At this moment, the surroundings were utterly silent.

The several million soldiers who hadn’t gone out to battle heard everything clearly.

Each and every one was profoundly shocked.

What was going on?

Traitors?

What did that mean?

In the distance, Xia Longwu’s eyes flickered, and he said loudly, “Your Majesty Emperor Yu, did you say Minshan Hou died at the hands of traitors?”

Su Yu calmly replied, “I have received reliable intelligence that Minshan Hou was betrayed by a traitor and died at the hands of various races! Not only that, in the previous tide, Hundred Battle King could have won a great victory, but due to traitors, he suffered a crushing defeat, almost leading to the extinction of our Human Race!”

“The traitor is still alive, in the Upper Realm! Great Zhou King told me not to publicize this, as it is a top secret, fearing it would destabilize morale!”

“No, I must speak. I must tell everyone to be careful, to be vigilant! The Upper Realm is about to open. If everyone is unaware of the situation, if they carelessly fall into the traitors’ trap and die at their hands, how can my heart be at ease?”

Su Yu sighed, “Even if it destabilizes morale and military spirit, I must speak! Most of the traitors come from Control King’s lineage. Control King secretly colluded with an ancient emperor of the Devil Race, giving birth to a bloodline. This lineage’s heart lies with the Devil Race, and Silk Destroying King is from this lineage!”

“Silk Destroying King’s father, hundreds of years ago, even sought to exterminate the Human Race, but Principal Xia Chen discovered him and, with peerless power, killed him, perishing together! Principal Xia Chen is a descendant of a War King, responsible for passing on the flame of civilization. Today’s Eternals, and the ruins obtained by the principals of various academies, were all passed down by Principal Xia Chen!”

Su Yu declared loudly, “Principal Xia Chen was the Torchbearer of this tide! Yet he was killed by Silk Destroying King’s father, perishing together… How hateful that a generation’s inheritor of civilization died at the hands of such a mongrel!”

“Silk Destroying King’s mother, a descendant of Control King, and Silk Destroying King’s father’s sister, this lineage is utterly depraved. To perpetuate their mixed blood, she secretly colluded with Silk Destroying King’s father, giving birth to Silk Destroying King. She is now hidden somewhere in the Myriad Realms, perhaps in the Devil Realm! This woman possesses world-shaking power, with Daofuse strength, and has secretly killed countless powerhouses of our race. How hateful, how deserving of death…”

Su Yu enumerated their crimes one by one.

The soldiers and powerhouses on all sides listened, some filled with immense rage, others cursing incessantly!

Detestable!

Deserving of death!

Xia Longwu’s eyes flickered, and he asked again, “What about Hundred Battle King’s matter…”

“Hundred Battle King’s last battle was sabotaged by Control King’s lineage. He was suppressed somewhere and could not return, cutting off everyone’s path forward and preventing them from achieving Daofuse! Hundred Battle King, I do not blame him, but that traitor… deserves death!”

Su Yu said loudly, “Hundred Battle King trusted the traitor too much, entrusting great power to him, which led to the slaughter of allies, causing dozens of allied Human Race clans to be annihilated and dozens of Daofuse cultivators to be killed!”

“Hundred Battle King was simple, brave, kind, gentle, too soft-hearted. Despite his powerful strength, he couldn’t bear to kill anyone, only wishing for peaceful unification… He is a model for our generation, but he was too trusting of others.”

“…”

At this moment, some Eternals wore extremely strange expressions.

The soldiers and generals below were all grimacing.

Some hot-tempered, foul-mouthed ones couldn’t help but curse under their breath, “Hundred Battle King, the Human Lord of the previous tide, right? I heard people say he was kind and gentle… Emperor Yu even called him a model. Is he an idiot?”

“He caused the deaths of hundreds of Daofuse cultivators. Did our Human Race have so many Daofuse cultivators before?”

“Damn, how could this imbecile be the Human Lord?”

“I heard he had many powerhouses supporting him, all from the Upper Realm.”

“Are the Upper Realm powerhouses idiots too?”

“Didn’t Emperor Yu say? There are many traitors up there!”

“Damn it, no wonder our Human Race, once the ancient hegemon, is now in such a difficult situation. So, in the previous tide, hundreds of Daofuse cultivators were killed… This is truly speechless!”

“…”

Discussions continued.

Behind Su Yu, Great Zhou King’s face turned pale. He looked at Su Yu, and at this moment, a rare hint of pleading appeared in his eyes as he transmitted, “Emperor Yu, if Hundred Battle King’s reputation spreads, he… he will become a sinner of the Human Race… He…”

“Is he not?”

Su Yu also transmitted, calmly saying, “He is! I am merely reminding everyone to be careful, not to be foolish! Traitors definitely exist! Silk Destroying King’s mother, a Heavenly King-level powerhouse, has already been captured by me! There are still people from this lineage in the Upper Realm!”

“I don’t want to repeat history. I want to announce to the world that there are many traitors in the Upper Realm, and that is a fact!”

“I also want to announce to the world that Hundred Battle King was indeed tricked. I didn’t say he was a traitor; that’s giving him face, giving him respect! He squandered the Human Race’s hundred-thousand-year foundation. Did I slander him in any way?”

Su Yu said coldly, staring at him, making Great Zhou King’s heart turn cold.

Su Yu sneered, “Now you try! I’ve given him face, and I’ve given all of you enough face! Perhaps Hundred Battle King has already appeared, perhaps he’s been waiting, even waiting for me to lay this foundation for him, so he can come and pick up an easy gain!”

“I don’t mind using the worst intentions to speculate about people like you!”

“But… am I, Su Yu, a fool?”

Su Yu scoffed, then said loudly, “There were too many traitors. Hundred Battle King was powerful, surpassing Tiangu of the Xianzu, Mojǐ of the Devil Race, and Jiwu of the Shenzu. He could kill ten or even a hundred Daofuse cultivators alone, yet he still suffered a crushing defeat, with a hundred Human Race Daofuse cultivators perishing, while the myriad races suffered less than thirty casualties… How lamentable!”

Su Yu sighed, “Hundred Battle King is about to return. I hope he can recognize where he went wrong and not make the same mistakes again. If he can comprehend everything, with his strength, I will abdicate and assist him in unifying the Myriad Realms! I only hope he doesn’t squander our Human Race’s hundreds of thousands of years of foundation again!”

As soon as these words were spoken, Xia Longwu on the other side said coldly, “Impossible! How can Emperor Yu do this? Hundred Battle King was blind in judgment and indecisive. No matter how strong he is, he’s just a brute! A brute isn’t even qualified; a brute can only kill more strong enemies! Our Human Race in this tide has risen from weakness, step by step, to reach where we are today, always winning against the strong with the weak, winning every battle! Yet, when strong against weak, we were beaten to the point of national extinction! A hundred Daofuse cultivators in the previous tide were defeated. In this tide, the Human Race only has one Daofuse cultivator. Are we to let Hundred Battle King lead us to our deaths? I will not agree!”

On that side, several Eternals simultaneously shouted, “Impossible! General Xia’s intention is our intention! Emperor Yu has won every battle, and the allied armies rely entirely on Emperor Yu’s protection. If Hundred Battle King returns and ascends to the position of Human Lord, how can the dozens of ancient races that were annihilated in the previous tide, like the Iron Devourer Race, feel at ease?”

“The various races assist the Human Race because of Emperor Yu’s name, not Hundred Battle King’s name. Hundred Battle King trusted treacherous individuals. If he replaces Emperor Yu, the allied armies will surely collapse!”

“…”

A group of Eternals, including those from the Zhu family, Nan Wujiang, and other powerhouses from major prefectures.

They were not fools.

Some matters were secrets of the higher echelons, but now that Su Yu had made them public, they understood what Su Yu wanted and knew his intentions.

And at this moment, the news had already spread among the several million soldiers. The next moment, someone among the million soldiers shouted, “We only revere Emperor Yu! The will of the people points to him. Even if Hundred Battle King returns, only Emperor Yu shall be revered!”

“What we want is Emperor Yu, who can win battles, not Hundred Battle King, who is powerful but squandered the Human Race’s foundation!”

“…”

Shouts continued!

No!

How could this be!

Hundred Battle King was actually unfamiliar to the lower ranks, but they knew one thing: despite having an absolute advantage, he was beaten by the myriad races, causing a hundred Daofuse cultivators to perish. Daofuse cultivators!

Now everyone knew what a Daofuse cultivator was—a Half-Emperor!

The Human Race, during the changes of the previous tide, actually had a hundred Half-Emperors!

My heavens!

Some people wanted to cry. So strong, yet how did they lose?

Hundred Battle King!

It was him!

Useless!

Emperor Yu even said he was incredibly powerful, capable of killing Tiangu and the others, so why didn’t he kill them?

Not only that, from the sound of it, the Human Race not having Daofuse cultivators seemed to be related to Hundred Battle King. Was he not dead, and still blocking everyone’s progress?

Was that what it meant?

Then it would be better if he just died!

…

Opposite Su Yu, Wan Tiansheng’s eyes were strange.

He looked at Su Yu, then at Great Zhou King.

He understood!

Why Su Yu had come to greet him.

Good kid, ruthless enough.

Since there are still people waiting for your return, I will cut off your path. When you return, your reputation will be utterly foul!

Purification Bureau!

Wan Tiansheng pondered these thoughts, while Su Yu said loudly, “Principal Wan is fair and just, strict with himself, and devoted solely to the Human Race, disregarding his own reputation. He is a model for humanity! Therefore, your student, Su Yu, hopes Principal Wan will take charge of the Purification Bureau, to cleanse the Human Race of its impurities! To contribute to the rise of our Human Race! To prevent Control King and the Devil Emperor’s bloodline from infiltrating the Human Race’s upper echelons!”

Wan Tiansheng’s mind raced, and he quickly said loudly, “Wan Tiansheng accepts the order. Emperor Yu overpraises me! I, Wan, will certainly not allow fiends to infiltrate our Human Race!”

“Excellent!”

Su Yu’s laughter was hearty. He reached out, and the Human Lord Seal descended from the sky. White clouds gathered in the void, instantly forming a scroll.

Su Yu wrote the appointment letter with a brush, and the next moment, the Human Lord Seal fell!

Boom!

A surge of power of laws landed on Wan Tiansheng, and the Human Realm vibrated.

Wan Tiansheng’s phantom appeared above the Human Realm. This was the first Eternal to receive such treatment. Su Yu wanted everyone to know that this was his personal appointment.

He was not a Human Devil!

Wan Tiansheng was a Human Saint!

Executing justice on behalf of heaven!

Beside him, Great Zhou King closed his eyes for a moment, then regained his composure, no longer speaking.

On all sides, the powerhouses fell silent.

Su Yu chuckled. The golden scroll landed in Wan Tiansheng’s hand. The next moment, Su Yu laughed loudly, “Principal Wan’s strength is comparable to a sixth-stage Eternal, but it’s still too weak, insufficient to suppress traitors. I bestow upon the Principal a great opportunity. Come with me to traverse the Grand Dao of Heaven and
