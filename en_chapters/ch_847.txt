Chapter 847: A Small Test of Strength

In the blink of an eye, Su Yu's side had slaughtered all the rulers of laws!

The cost was not insignificant, though it wasn't overwhelming either. The Human Emperor's physical body was even more damaged, the Martial Emperor fell from second-tier to first-tier, and the Human Ancestor's bamboo staff shattered...

These things, to Su Yu, were not of great importance. What mattered was that shortly after the battle began, he had achieved a heaven-defying record of 0 to 29!

When the last wave of enemies, in utter despair, resorted to self-destruction, Su Yu's side had almost reached a conclusion. Of course, at this moment, the Nether Emperor was still alive!

In the distance, a group of Myriad Races experts watched in shock, their hearts filled with dread. Were these people really from the Myriad Realms?

They recognized many of them! That... that person pretending to be the Culture King, who exactly was he? He wasn't the Culture King!

At this moment, everyone was certain that he wasn't the Culture King!

The Nether Emperor's face also changed drastically, his heart filled with fear. After years of war, they had grown accustomed to losses, to death. The Myriad Races had also used self-destruction to harm enemies when the Human Emperor was not yet severely injured. But ever since the Human Emperor was injured and existed only as a shadow, such large-scale self-destruction had not been seen.

The Nether Emperor was somewhat dazed. The battle had actually just begun, less than three minutes ago!

A battle between the strong was like this. Either it lasted for days, or victory and defeat were decided in an instant. Battles that lasted for days usually involved evenly matched forces, resulting in minimal losses. The longer a battle between the strong lasted, the smaller the losses, which was the norm for major battles.

A battle that ended in a short time meant that one side had definitely been routed!

Routed! Unless it was a probing battle, it wouldn't end so quickly.

At this moment, the Nether Emperor's face completely changed. Trouble!

Those people were all dead, and the others were momentarily intimidated. At this moment, no one dared to come over, including the Myriad Races experts who had previously blocked the Human Emperor's physical body. They were all retreating in fear!

The Nether Emperor knew that he was at his most dangerous moment. If those strong individuals on the periphery came to kill him, he... would definitely die!

First-tier was very strong! A peerless expert of the Myriad Realms! But here, this guy pretending to be the Culture King also had first-tier combat power, and there was also a War King at the peak of second-tier, along with over thirty other strong individuals. He absolutely couldn't match them.

At this moment, the Nether Emperor suddenly roared, "If I die in battle, with one less first-tier, the Myriad Races will surely collapse!"

Upon hearing this, everyone understood his meaning. He was calling for reinforcements!

Just then, the Divine Emperor, who was fighting the Human Emperor, suddenly shouted coldly, "Let the Nether Emperor withdraw. If the battle continues, the Human Emperor will surely die!"

The Nether Emperor was first-tier, and at this moment, the Myriad Races were in disarray, but the Divine Emperor and others knew that this strong individual could not be killed.

After the Divine Emperor finished speaking, he roared, "Kill! We haven't fallen behind yet. The Human Emperor's physical body is collapsing, and his sea of will is turbulent. Killing the Human Emperor is worth any number of deaths!"

Boom!

As he spoke, a large seal appeared in his hand, seemingly the Divine Race's seal! With one strike, it suppressed all directions, a surge of divine power erupted, shaking the heavens and earth. The Divine Emperor roared, "Immortal Emperor, stop pretending to be dead. Do you really want to be defeated?"

Upon hearing this, the Immortal Emperor, who had just been severely injured, had a change in expression. In the next moment, he suddenly let out a low roar, and in the void, a tree resembling the Tree of Life instantly pierced through the long river!

All the recently injured Myriad Races experts instantly felt a strong life force pouring into their bodies, rapidly healing their injuries!

The Immortal Emperor's long hair fluttered, his face pale. In an instant, he restored everyone's injuries, coughed, and spat out a mouthful of golden blood, but ignored it, shouting, "Kill! As long as you don't die, I can save you!"

With this, the previously shaken Myriad Races experts regained some morale and roared, causing the Human Race to retreat step by step!

Even though Su Yu had killed so many strong individuals and five had betrayed them, the Myriad Races experts still far outnumbered the Human Race.

In the blink of an eye, a thunderous roar echoed through the heavens and earth. A Human Race expert was besieged and killed on the spot by six rulers of laws!

The Divine Emperor's angry shout rose again, "Kill! Fight to the death, or else, if he kills the Nether Emperor, he won't spare us. Even if we retreat, the next battle will end in defeat!"

At this point, the few Myriad Races experts no longer held any hope for peace. The Human Race clearly wouldn't wait to return to the Myriad Realms for a decisive battle. This time's scheme was obviously to end the battle early and return to the Myriad Realms ahead of schedule.

With the Divine Emperor's roar, a powerful divine light erupted, covering all the Myriad Races. Everyone suddenly felt their fear dissipate!

Divine blessing!

With the Divine Emperor's divine blessing and the Immortal Emperor's healing, the two supreme beings were paying a huge price to ensure that this battle wouldn't collapse quickly. Once routed, no matter how many there were, it would be useless.

Only by fighting again!

Either let Su Yu's side allow the Nether Emperor to return, or fight to the death, even if it's one for one, it would weaken the Human Race's strength!

...

At the rear.

Su Yu frowned slightly. It was always like this! When the Myriad Races were strong, they were easier to deal with, but once they fell behind, they became a bunch of crazy guys. At this point, they actually became more united!

It was always like this! Without exception!

The Myriad Races' survival, warring with the Human Race for countless years, wasn't without reason. These guys, when strong, would have internal strife, but when weak, they would unite, much like the Human Race.

This also made it extremely difficult to annihilate the Myriad Races!

At this moment, the Human Emperor coldly shouted, "Kill! Su Yu, kill the Nether Emperor. I also want to see how long they can fight!"

"Fearless of the divine, then fight!"

The Divine Emperor shouted, the power of the Great Dao spreading, empowering all the strong individuals. With a loud boom, another Human Race expert was killed on the spot!

The Myriad Races, with their injuries healed and divine blessing, were also incredibly fierce!

The Human Emperor also roared, "Do you really think I don't exist?"

The two great experts, while fighting him, were still able to assist others, clearly taking advantage of his severely injured physical body and sea of will, unable to stop them!

The Human Emperor's shadow trembled, and he roared. At this moment, the Human Emperor's physical body, which had just fallen into the river of time, suddenly traversed the void and appeared in front of the Human Emperor in an instant.

The Human Emperor's shadow blinked and merged into it!

It turned out he wasn't unable to summon it instantly before, but was cooperating with Su Yu's plan.

Of course, the moment his physical body and true self merged, Su Yu's face changed slightly, and not just him, the Divine Emperor also roared, "Do you really want to die?"

Boom!

At this moment, everyone noticed something unusual. The Human Emperor's physical body and sea of will, which seemed to have shared the damage before, were barely maintained. Now, upon merging, the injuries seemed to worsen, even doubling.

His physical body was rapidly collapsing! His sea of will was also rapidly withering.

However, at the moment of merging, the Human Emperor's aura became incomparably powerful. In the blink of an eye, he erupted with an incredibly strong light, holding the Human Lord Seal, suppressing the heavens and earth with one strike. With a loud boom, just as the Divine Emperor was about to counterattack, his physical body was shattered by the strike!

The Divine Emperor quickly fled, and the Immortal Emperor also hurriedly retreated. The Demon Emperor, who had been entangled, was struck on the head by the Human Emperor's seal, causing his head to explode!

At this moment, the Human Emperor was incomparably powerful, unmatched in bravery!

However, his physical body was rapidly collapsing.

The Demon Emperor roared, his head growing back quickly, and he fled in panic, going mad! The Human Emperor suddenly went berserk! Was he not afraid of death?

The Human Emperor snorted coldly, looked at his own physical body, and sneered, "You think I can't deal with you?"

With that, his physical body suddenly ignited!

"I said, if I die, you will also tremble in fear!"

Boom!

In an instant, he broke through the void, appearing in front of a ruler of laws, smashing him into pulp with one strike. His figure flickered, and in the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of another strong individual, shattering him into pieces with a palm strike!

He was burning his physical body! Just making use of waste!

His physical body was almost destroyed, nurtured for many years, the injuries from the Great Dao hadn't healed, and he had just endured a wave of self-destruction's power, it was already a waste.

At this point, the Human Emperor didn't care if he could recover. He wanted to scare the Myriad Races first!

...

At the rear, Su Yu's eyes flickered. In the next moment, he roared, "Come, surround and kill him!"

He didn't go to aid the Human Emperor over there. With so many strong individuals, they should first surround and kill the Nether Emperor. First-tier was hard to kill, even for Su Yu, who had reached first-tier, it was difficult to kill the Nether Emperor.

Every first-tier was extremely hard to kill! Just look at the Human Emperor, he didn't chase the heavily injured three great experts, because it was really hard to kill them.

Rather than chasing, it was better to kill some rulers of laws first!

At this moment, in the distance, the three fleeing great experts looked serious. The Immortal Emperor shouted, "Retreat! He only has the strength for one battle. Wait for his physical body to collapse, then fight again!"

There's no need to clash head-on with the Human Emperor now!

As for the Nether Emperor... there's nothing that can be done. He's deep inside, surrounded by many strong individuals, and the hope of the Nether Emperor escaping is extremely slim.

A large number of Myriad Races experts retreated one after another, and the Human Emperor roared, "Pursue and kill!"

While his physical body hadn't completely burned out, kill as many as possible!

Once his physical body completely collapsed, and the three great experts counterattacked, he would be helpless.

At this moment, the Human Emperor also viewed life and death lightly. No other reason, Su Yu... damn, he's cunning, damn, he's strong, damn, he's ruthless!

This guy, a ruthless character!

If this battle could cripple the Myriad Races, even if he really died, Su Yu could still hold on.

He wanted to test Su Yu, only to find... damn, this guy can really fight!

His decisiveness was terrifyingly strong.

The Human Emperor was even contemplating that if he truly fell in battle, he would ensure that his world merged into Su Yu's world before his death. This would undoubtedly elevate Su Yu to the highest rank. With the augmentation of the world, as long as he guarded this path, the Myriad Races would not dare to return to the Myriad Realms. With the expansion of Su Yu's world, the Myriad Races would have no choice but to enter it. 

In this way, it was only a matter of time before the Myriad Races were eradicated!

With these calculations, the Human Emperor suddenly realized that even if he died, this guy could still hold the line! A formidable character indeed!

...

The Human Emperor fought with reckless abandon, burning his flesh in battle. He swiftly slaughtered powerful enemies!

Meanwhile, Su Yu's expression turned cold as he shouted, "Abandon all power, merge it into the world, suppress him!"

Hearing this, Tongtian and the others hesitated for a moment but quickly complied, channeling all their power into the Great Dao. Chains of the Great Dao manifested by Su Yu rapidly moved to suppress the Nether Emperor!

The Nether Emperor attempted to flee, only to find himself surrounded by over thirty strands of the Great Dao's power from all directions.

Despair filled the Nether Emperor's face as he roared, "If you kill me, your world will also be damaged, you..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to listen. Countless strands of the Great Dao's power descended upon the Nether Emperor, who roared in defiance. A fierce aura of death erupted, corroding everything, even the myriad paths. The Netherworld rapidly expanded, threatening to burst this world!

However, even as several strands of the Great Dao snapped, the power of the Great Dao only grew stronger. Despair filled his face. Was this the end for him?

No... I don't want to die!

At that moment, the Nether Emperor seemed to think of something. Suddenly, his expression changed, and he roared, "I'll take you down with me!"

His aura suddenly surged to its peak!

It seemed he was about to self-destruct!

Outside, Su Yu frowned slightly. Self-destruction... this could be troublesome.

But he was prepared for it.

If he wants to self-destruct, let him!

Yet, at that moment, something unexpected happened. The Nether Emperor glanced around and suddenly charged towards Zhan Wang. Zhan Wang's face turned purple. No!

I'm leaving!

Damn it, don't do this, I'll be blown to bits!

Why am I so unlucky!

He quickly fled. Even as a second-tier peak expert, he would be killed by this guy's self-destruction!

Zhan Wang fled rapidly towards the depths of the world, escaping was not shameful, staying would get him killed!

He ran swiftly!

The Nether Emperor's eyes showed a hint of struggle.

A desperate measure!

Or rather, to escape, he had to... do this to have a chance.

With so many powerful beings and the world suppressing him, he saw only one way to escape!

Yes, he had one way to escape.

At his level, even without opening a world, he had some understanding of the world.

Seeing Zhan Wang flee, he looked around at the rulers of laws, who were all merging their power into the Great Dao to suppress him. At this moment, all the power converged on Su Yu...

The next moment, the Nether Emperor made a decision!

I... don't want to die!

As for the desperate measure... I can't care about that now!

There's no other way!

Perhaps this is a path to death, but it's better than dying here!

"Let's die together!"

The Great Dao collapsed, a roar echoed through the world, and Su Yu's expression changed. He really self-destructed. These Myriad Races experts were indeed ruthless, worthy of battling the Human Emperor for years.

However, in the next moment, he suddenly sensed something amiss!

The Nether Emperor's Great Dao power was severed, but not completely. It felt like 90% was cut, yet there was still a connection. At that instant, an immensely powerful aura of death surged into Su Yu's world!

This formidable power didn't destroy but instead merged into Su Yu's world in the blink of an eye, willingly!

Too strong!

The immense power merged, causing Su Yu to momentarily struggle to bear it, an existence of the first tier!

He had to quickly suppress this power, forcibly absorbing it!

But the power was too strong, causing the world to tremble and expand violently!

Su Yu was momentarily distracted. As he suppressed this powerful force, the Nether Emperor's eyes lit up. In an instant, he traversed the void, and Su Yu couldn't stop him. He watched helplessly as the guy crazily fled from his world.

Not only that, after escaping the world, the guy roared, "Immortal Emperor!"

In the distance, the Immortal Emperor's face changed. Suddenly, a powerful life force surged into the Nether Emperor's body.

With this powerful life force, the Netherworld expanded, and in the blink of an eye, it covered the area in front of the Human Emperor and others. With a buzz, his true form appeared among the fleeing Myriad Races experts!

The Human Emperor instinctively punched, shattering the Netherworld, but the Nether Emperor flickered and was instantly drawn to the Immortal Emperor's Great Dao, arriving near the Immortal Emperor and others!

He escaped!

...

The Human Emperor couldn't help but look back at Su Yu, damn it, how did you let him escape?

Su Yu was also dumbfounded!

At this moment, his world continued to expand, his strength rapidly increasing. He opened his mouth, speechless for a long time.

How did I let him escape?

It wasn't me who let him escape, it was this guy... damn, he willingly merged over 90% of his Great Dao power into my world, causing me to be overwhelmed, my world to be overwhelmed!

This caused me to be unable to stop him!

Damn!

Su Yu was stunned, he had learned something new. This was like being overwhelmed with milk!

This move was incredible!

If the Nether Emperor had self-destructed or fought to the death, Su Yu wouldn't have been afraid. A death battle was a death battle, at worst, the world would be damaged, but he could definitely kill the Nether Emperor!

But... but the guy knew he would die, so he overwhelmed himself!

"Nether Emperor..."

Su Yu murmured, impressed!

You did this to survive, screwing over your Myriad Races!

He must have known that merging his Great Dao power into Su Yu's world would quickly make Su Yu stronger, but compared to dying now, Su Yu becoming stronger was fine, at least there was still a chance.

Once dead, there was no chance at all.

At this point, Su Yu truly admired these veteran experts. They were much wiser and more resourceful than the Myriad Races of the Myriad Realms. In that situation, if it were Su Yu himself, it would have been a dead end.

Because he never considered merging his Great Dao into someone else's world, helping the opponent become stronger, and then overwhelming the opponent to escape!

For most people, it would be a certain death situation!

But... the Nether Emperor escaped!

The Great Dao was 90% severed, a severe injury, but even a severe injury was better than death!

He escaped alive from the encirclement of over thirty rulers of laws. This achievement, even a million years later, would be recorded heavily!

"Nether Emperor, what a talent!"

At this moment, Su Yu praised, what a damn talent!

And now, his world continued to expand, his strength increasing, and within the world, a strand of the Great Dao's power instantly strengthened. The Nether Emperor primarily cultivated the Nether Death Path, similar to the Path of Death.

How strong is 90% of a first-tier expert's Great Dao power?

Looking at this strand of the Great Dao's power, which instantly surpassed all the Great Dao powers in Su Yu's world, it was evident. In the blink of an eye, this strand of the Great Dao gave Su Yu the feeling that it could even support a second-tier expert!

This might be the first second-tier Great Dao in his world!

Su Yu had no second-tier Great Dao. He extracted the source of the myriad paths to reach the second-tier peak, but now, Su Yu felt that after digesting this power, he could definitely exert first-tier combat power in this world!

Outside the world, he could also exert mid to upper second-tier, even peak combat power.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng and the others also sensed it, each one dumbfounded, what a talent!

Really a talent!

They were all stunned, was this even possible?

Aiding the enemy!

A first-tier expert, to escape, came up with this method, truly not easy!

Tongtian Marquis and the Chaos Dragon, who hadn't merged their paths into Su Yu's world, still had combat power, but they were also stunned, momentarily dazed, allowing the Nether Emperor to escape.

Anyone would be stunned!

And the fleeing Zhan Wang in the distance was also momentarily stunned, then cursed madly!

Damn!

He scared me!

He was scared away by the Nether Emperor. Otherwise, as a second-tier peak expert, how could the Nether Emperor escape? But the Nether Emperor's self-destructive attitude, wanting to drag him down, startled him, making him flee.

At this moment, he regretted it to death!

Careless!

No wonder the Nether Emperor kept chasing him before escaping, just to force him to flee.

Su Yu was still digesting that powerful force, watching the Nether Emperor escape. Everyone here was receiving the world's power, and with the Nether Emperor's actions, it was hard to pursue.

Everyone was somewhat indigested!

Su Yu had to shout, "Don't chase a cornered enemy!"

Stop chasing!

Continuing the pursuit might lead to trouble, and the Human Emperor, whose flesh was almost burned out, roared, smashing another ruler of laws with a seal, quickly shouting, "Retreat, retreat into Su Yu's world!"

He quickly ordered everyone to retreat!

Don't chase anymore!

Continuing might lead to a counterattack.

Once his flesh completely collapsed, without his deterrence, the Myriad Races might counterattack.

Soon, the group retreated.

In the blink of an eye, they retreated into Su Yu's world, each one feeling as if they were dreaming. The battle... was over?

Just like that, it ended in an instant?

In less than five minutes!

And the number of strong ones killed might exceed the number of rulers of laws killed over the years.

In this battle, Su Yu's side killed 29 rulers of laws.

On the Myriad Races' side, they killed one traitor, making it 30.

The Human Emperor went berserk at the end, killing 5 rulers of laws, and others killed 2 during the pursuit, totaling 37 rulers of laws from the Myriad Races.

Among them, 4 were traitors who had defected to the Myriad Races, now standing in the distance, not moving.

That made 41 in total!

Out of 125 Myriad Races rulers of laws, only 84 escaped.

In the fierce battle, while Su Yu's side suffered no losses, the Human Emperor's forces, outnumbered, lost four rulers of laws. The Myriad Races, under the support of the Immortal Emperor and Divine Emperor, managed to inflict these casualties. However, the Human Emperor's side still had 48 rulers of laws surviving, so the losses weren't too severe. With a casualty ratio of 4 to 41, and considering the four strong defectors from the Myriad Races, it was as if there were no losses at all. Of course, the dead were still dead. But in the midst of war, such concerns were secondary.

Below the level of rulers of laws, both sides suffered significant losses, with the Human Race taking a heavier hit. Previously, there were over 80 strong individuals below the ruler of laws level, but the sudden outbreak and intensity of the battle resulted in over 20 deaths. Now, only about 60 ancient marquises remained. On the opposing side, there were nearly a hundred ancient marquises before, slightly more than the Human Race, and they suffered slightly fewer losses, with over ten deaths. Below the ruler of laws level, the gap wasn't large, as neither side specifically targeted the weaker ones, resulting in fewer losses for them. The opposing side still had nearly 90 strong individuals below the ruler of laws level.

After the battle, both sides had lost many powerful individuals. However, at the level of rulers of laws, the opposing side lost ten times more than the Human Race. Yet, when the Human Emperor and his forces retreated, the previously jubilant Human Race suddenly fell silent. With a thunderous crash, the Human Emperor's physical body completely collapsed, his powerful body instantly merging into Su Yu's world. The Human Emperor's shadow reappeared, showing signs of disintegration, but it barely held together without fully collapsing.

The Human Emperor, however, was carefree, not caring much, though he was somewhat speechless and frustrated. "Damn, I feel like cursing. My body has collapsed, and I only managed to heavily injure the Divine Emperor and others, killing a few rulers of laws. Yet, it seems... I didn't kill as many as you did?"

His mood wasn't great. As for his body collapsing, it was just that—collapsing. He was still alive, after all. It wasn't a big deal, just a bit frustrating. He was such a formidable figure, yet he hadn't killed as many as the others. It was annoying! Of course, he didn't dwell on it. After all, he was the Human Emperor. Dealing with these powerful beings was his duty.

However, his nonchalance couldn't change the atmosphere on the scene. At this moment, the strong individuals on Su Yu's side retreated behind him, while the Human Emperor's subordinates wore expressions of grief. Losing a few rulers of laws in a military confrontation was just part of war. They were used to it. But the complete collapse of the Human Emperor's physical body, along with the violent trembling of his sea of will, posed an imminent threat of death. This was what truly saddened everyone. If their leader died, their spiritual faith would collapse, and they couldn't imagine what they would face next.

Su Yu's expression was also somewhat grave. The Human Emperor's injuries were indeed severe. Only now did he realize that if the Human Emperor hadn't been incredibly powerful, he would have long since dissipated into the world. He had maintained this state for years, unwilling to die because he couldn't afford to. If he died, the Human Race would have collapsed long ago.

Soon, Su Yu relaxed his brow and said with a smile, "Your Majesty, the Human Emperor, is still quite formidable. Although slightly inferior to my side, you have more strong individuals. Let's call it a draw!"

The Human Emperor laughed heartily, "Are you saying I can't afford to lose?"

Then he laughed again, "You're right, I can't afford to lose! So let's call it a draw!"

Su Yu laughed too. At this moment, he looked around at the Human Emperor's fierce generals. They were indeed brave! With nearly a two-to-one combat ratio, these guys fought fiercely without hesitation! Compared to Su Yu's side, these veterans were just as, if not more, ferocious!

Su Yu preferred to fight only when he was sure of victory. But they didn't have that luxury. Every battle was a fight to the death, and those who survived were all very brave! At this moment, they suppressed their sorrow, not wanting to mention the Human Emperor's situation, and looked at Su Yu.

The Human Emperor laughed heartily, "I forgot to introduce you all! This is Su Yu, the tenth generation Human Lord, in his twenties, an opener! He's almost... first-class now! He quelled the chaos of the Myriad Realms, executed the traitors of the Human Race, expelled the strong of the Myriad Races into the Gate of Hell, and unified the Upper Realm, Myriad Realms, and Death Realm. This time, he brought his people to rescue us. Hahaha, it's embarrassing that we need a junior to rescue us..."

He laughed heartily, showing no sign of sadness. He introduced Su Yu's achievements and continued to laugh, "Everyone probably knows him already. Xingyue was resurrected by him before, a formidable character! This time, it was his suggestion to take advantage of his arrival, unknown to the Myriad Races, to trap them!"

"Hey, I have to say, this kid has a knack for it. I thought I'd send 30 strong individuals his way to see how many he could kill, to see if he could achieve a one-to-one ratio... Goodness, this kid is amazing. Without shedding a drop of blood, he wiped them all out! That fool of a Nether Emperor, in his bid to escape, even helped him expand his world..."

"Hahaha!"

The Human Emperor laughed again, "Impressive, disguising as Wen Lao Er. I almost didn't recognize him. With that skill, you're a cunning... cough, a wise and resourceful guy! I thought you might manage to kill 30 rulers of laws, and if you didn't lose 20 on your side, it would be lucky... But you did it, unscathed, and even improved yourself... I'm impressed!"

"Although you're a bit weaker than me, not as brave as me fighting three emperors at once, for a commander, being that fierce is useless. I was fierce, and now... my body is done for!"

The Human Emperor kept laughing. Su Yu looked at him and suddenly said, "No need to flatter me! Your old comrades know very well that if you think you can die and they'll follow me because of your words... you're oversimplifying it! So, the best way is to stay alive! Being alive... is hope!"

The Human Emperor wanted to pave the way for him. But Su Yu didn't need it! Su Yu calmly said, "I don't need you to pave the way for me, nor do I want to take over your people. They've been with you for too long, and they might not get along with me. Instead of having them follow me, it's better if you lead them yourself! It's just a collapsed body. You are the Human Emperor, the emperor of the Human Race. Such a small matter shouldn't defeat you!"

A small matter? The Human Emperor felt bitter. It wasn't a small matter; you know nothing! If it were a small matter, why would I be like this? If I could recover, I wouldn't even bother with you, kid! Paving the way for you? What are you thinking?

Su Yu looked at him, frowning, "It's no big deal. Dying is easy; living is hard! You've opened your world. At worst, merge into the world and become the spirit of that world. What's the big deal? Doubao, Flatbread, these beings, you know them well! If I were you, as long as I could live, who cares about the body? Does the dignified Human Emperor need a 22-year-old to advise him?"

The Human Emperor was taken aback, looking at Su Yu, and suddenly laughed, "You... when you lecture people, you do have a bit of Wen Lao Er's demeanor..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "He's not as good as me! No need to put me on par with the Culture King! At least I don't harm my own people. My brothers know this well. I harm enemies, not my own! Of course, I understand he did it to save his sister... But he left without resolving the troubles... In that, he's not as good as me!"

Such bold words! The Human Emperor laughed, "With that tone... if the Culture King heard it, he probably wouldn't be convinced!"

Su Yu laughed too, "So what? I've met him before. I entered the Heaven Gate once and met the Culture King and Martial King. I told him he was a troublemaker to his face. What could he do? I spoke the truth. If he can't accept that... then he's even less worthy of being compared to me! I inherited his pen dao, so I'm half his successor, also half the Time Sage's successor... My relationship with him and the Time Sage is complicated. I admire him, but I also don't. Is there a problem with that?"

He admired the Culture King's strength and carefree nature but didn't admire the mess he left behind. Since he knew he was leaving and the Myriad Races might rebel, he should have resolved some issues before leaving, not just left, causing trouble for the Human Race and the Human Emperor. As for the Martial King... he was a fool. The Culture King should have warned him not to wander off before leaving. He probably didn't, which led the Martial King to seek him out, and that's also his fault!

So, Su Yu had mixed feelings about the Culture King—admiration on one hand, and frustration on the other.

The Human Emperor laughed, and those around him looked at Su Yu, some clearly unconvinced. The Culture King was also one of their idols! Su Yu's criticism of the Culture King didn't sit well with them!

Su Yu knew they were displeased, which was normal. People have their biases. He wasn't familiar with these people, and the Culture King was their second brother who fought alongside them through the heavens. But... he wasn't going to indulge them!

Before they could speak, Su Yu quickly said, "Alright, enough about the Culture King! Talking too much is pointless. We're still waiting to rescue them, not counting on them to save us!"

Su Yu was calm, "This battle was a minor victory. We didn't kill a single first-class, and the Myriad Races' strength was damaged, but they still have 84 rulers of laws. Moreover, with so many rulers of laws dead, those Heavenly Venerables might break through, perhaps quite a few... Soon, they might have 90 rulers of laws!"

"And we... the Human Emperor's side, only has 48 left!"

Su Yu shook his head, "I have even fewer, counting Xingyue, only 37!"

The Human Emperor looked at him and, after a while, said, "Xingyue... is my sister!"

That's my person!

Su Yu chuckled, "What's the matter? Xingyue's Life and Death Path belongs to me! Wasn't it through me that she was revived? Is the Human Emperor planning to fight me for her?"

Eighty-five experts stood together, including four from the Myriad Races, who awkwardly stood aside. In total, there were eighty-nine rulers of laws. This time, the human race lost four experts in battle. It was uncertain if any of the survivors could break through. Even if they did, it would only be one or two.

In terms of numbers, they maintained a balance with the opposing side. In terms of quality... the Human Emperor was now half-crippled, perhaps even fully so, and might not be as strong as the opposition. However, the disparity in combat strength was no longer as vast as before.

The opposing top-tier experts were also heavily injured, especially the Nether Emperor, who would find recovery difficult. The Divine Emperor and his companions were also significantly wounded.

As Su Yu conversed with the Human Emperor, a formidable figure stepped forward from the Human Emperor's side, exuding a fierce aura. Wielding a machete, he coldly addressed the Martial Emperor, "Martial Emperor?"

The Martial Emperor's expression turned grim. He seemed to recognize the person opposite him. At this moment, nine female generals stepped forward simultaneously, all of them powerful.

The Martial Emperor's face grew even more unsightly. He had fallen to the third tier! He couldn't even compare to the second-tier expert among them. Were these Taishan's family members? He gritted his teeth, his expression sour.

Su Yu, however, spoke indifferently, "Enough! Let men handle men's affairs! If the Martial King can't resolve this himself and needs his family to intervene, then he's a waste, though he's already a waste!"

"Outrageous!" The Suppressing Martial King roared in anger. Su Yu's eyes turned cold, "Impudent! The Martial King has dragged down countless people; he knows it, and so do you! If you dare act presumptuously in front of me again, I'll cut you down without mercy! Even with the Human Emperor here, I'll cut you down!"

Su Yu's imposing presence was overwhelming. The Suppressing Martial King was momentarily intimidated, his face turning sour as he mumbled something, snorted, and retreated.

Su Yu snorted coldly, "Everyone, calm down. The Human Emperor is gravely injured. If you want him to survive, if you want to survive, then calm down! The grievances between the Martial Emperor and the Martial King are theirs to resolve. Everyone else, step aside! Otherwise, don't blame me, Su Yu, for not showing respect to you seniors!"

Su Yu's aura was fierce, intimidating all around. Standing proudly above the river, he spoke indifferently, "I respect the Human Emperor and all of you, but I am the overlord of this world. If anyone thinks they can stand on equal footing with me, go kill thirty rulers of laws first, then come talk to me!"

His words left everyone speechless. They suddenly remembered that despite his youth, he was indeed a ruthless person!

Among the crowd, the Martial Emperor bared his teeth. Damn it... this felt... a bit embarrassing. Yet, there was... a certain satisfaction! Truly satisfying! Just moments ago, he thought those crazy women were going to kill him. He never expected Su Yu, this madman, to directly scold them, forcing a first-tier expert to retreat.

Even in front of the Human Emperor, Su Yu was so domineering. Previously, it felt unpleasant, but today... it suddenly felt exhilarating!

Opposite, the Human Emperor chuckled, "Alright, the Suppressing Martial King is straightforward and direct! Let Taishan and the Martial Emperor resolve their own issues. We don't even know if they'll return, no need to make a fuss over this! The Martial Emperor, this guy, I've wanted to kill him myself, but fine, this time I see he's made significant contributions and has reformed. That's good!"

The Martial Emperor awkwardly replied, "Why are you picking on me? I haven't offended you!"

Really!

Su Yu didn't dwell on the matter further. Soon, he smiled, flicked his robe, and said, "Just joking. I don't mind giving the Martial Emperor a beating, hahaha, I don't like him either. But let's wait. At least let me help him recover his strength. This time he broke the Heaven Gate and severed his path. I, for one, value loyalty!"

His smile was radiant, and the Human Emperor also chuckled, letting the matter pass.

Together, they looked towards the distant Myriad Race Continent. At this moment, the atmosphere was tense and cautious. Su Yu couldn't help but laugh loudly, "Myriad Race traitors, surrender early. Your foundation in the Myriad Realms has long been eradicated by me. I've left you some roots, but don't force me to completely destroy your foundation!"

Su Yu was extremely domineering at this moment, and he shouted, "Thank you, Nether Emperor. If you come to surrender, I will spare your life! Thank you for helping me ascend to the first-tier realm!"

Upon hearing this, the other side fell silent for a moment. The next moment, a powerful presence spoke with a hint of coldness and anger, "Who are you?"

"Su Yu!" Su Yu replied with a smile, "Remember this name. In the Myriad Realms, when Tiangu and the others hear my name, they tremble in fear! When the Divine Emperor's Consort hears my name, she will tell you, of all people, don't provoke me. In the final battle to pacify the Myriad Realms, they helped me eliminate powerful enemies, eradicate traitors, and fled to the Gate of Hell, unwilling to be my enemy. I think they must be very worried about you because I, Su Yu... am here!"

"They... went to the Gate of Hell?" The voice carried a hint of shock.

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Indeed, they went to investigate the Gate of Hell for me! If you think you can resist me, then try. This battle is just a small test. Within three months, I will surely pacify the Myriad Race threat!"

"Arrogant!" An angry shout came, even from the human side, with some looking oddly at Su Yu. This kid... can really boast!

But looking at the people behind Su Yu, each one was calm, as if saying, don't say three months, soon, you will be subdued!

At this moment, the expressions of these people were shocking. Especially among the crowd, some strong individuals saw familiar faces. The Snow King saw his daughter, the King Gong saw his descendants, and everyone felt a slight tremor in their hearts.

These people... seemed to have a firm belief! Just like they believed in the Human Emperor, they were unwavering in their faith!

Among the crowd, Heavendoom chuckled, "Three months? One month to pacify!"

Each one was more arrogant than the last!

At this moment, the Human Emperor smiled but said nothing, yet he transmitted his voice to Su Yu, "I'm almost done for!"

Su Yu's heart tightened, but his expression remained unchanged as he replied, "Even if you can't, hold on! Losing strength is fine, but dying is a big problem. If you don't die, your people won't be in chaos. With me here, at least I can deter the Myriad Races from acting rashly!"

He continued, "The Human Emperor fought to the death, killed five rulers of laws, and then couldn't go on... If you die now, I'll leave a heavy mark on history, recording it for all eternity! The dignified Human Emperor, fought to the death, killed fewer than I did!"

"..." The Human Emperor looked at him, smiled, and then stiffened, "Are you serious?"

"I'm not joking!"

The Human Emperor thought for a moment and nodded! Damn! This kid loves recording things, so when he says he'll engrave it for eternity, he might really mean it.

That... would be too embarrassing!

At this moment, the Human Emperor sighed and transmitted, "I love a good name, not profit. Don't ruin my reputation!"

I just want a good name, and you're ruining it!

The dignified Human Emperor, fought to the death, killed five trash rulers of laws... If this spreads, people will think my reputation is all talk. That's not okay. I severely injured three top-tier experts and stopped ten rulers of laws from self-destructing. Why don't you mention that?

Su Yu smiled, seemingly understanding his meaning, shrugged, and said, I just won't mention it. Achievements without killing aren't counted!

For a moment, the two exchanged a glance. Under the surprised gazes of the crowd, they suddenly laughed together, leaving everyone puzzled. What were these two talking about that made them so happy?
