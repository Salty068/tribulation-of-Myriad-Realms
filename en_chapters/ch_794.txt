Chapter 794: Catching Them Off Guard

Yes, the initiative was once again in Su Yu's hands.

When Su Yu mentioned that the Control King's lineage intended to summon a master of laws, the myriad races had no choice but to act and attack. On Su Yu's side, the presence of four Heavenly Sovereigns and three Heavenly Kings became crucial.

...

On Bamboo Mountain.

Su Yu stood with a smile, glancing towards Ren Mountain, then towards the depths of Chaos Mountain, and finally at the Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon. The great battle was about to begin. As for his role in all this, it would depend on the unfolding events.

Plans could never keep up with changes. The situation among the myriad races could shift at any moment. Su Yu never adhered to a fixed plan, as that would only trap him and make him unable to keep pace. Of course, he was the decision-maker, so he could adapt at any time. Unlike the myriad races, who had to consult on every matter, lacking the flexibility and opportunity to adapt. Even if someone wanted to change, others would worry about being harmed.

"It's about to start!" Su Yu murmured. "I came here to start the war. Everyone wants to delay, but sorry, I won't let you drag this out!"

...

Time passed slowly.

Suddenly, March spoke, "Your Majesty, someone is coming from Ren Mountain!"

Su Yu had anticipated this. They would definitely come! The main question was, who would it be?

Auras began to rise gradually. Moments later, several figures appeared.

Five powerful beings!

Tiangu of the Immortal Race, Moon Heavenly Venerable of the God Race, Mo Heavenly Venerable of the Demon Race, Ming Heavenly Venerable of the Nether Race, and Destiny Marquis!

The three major races, along with Destiny and Ming Heavenly Venerable, could barely represent the other races as well.

Su Yu wasn't surprised by the others but was surprised that Tiangu had come. That was the truly astonishing part! The people who came could mostly represent the will of their races. Could Tiangu, an emperor of the lower realm, still represent the Immortal Race of the Upper Realm?

A strange look appeared in Su Yu's eyes. Moreover, he didn't particularly enjoy dealing with people from the lower realm. The reason was simple: they were too familiar. In the Upper Realm, whether you pretended to be tough, foolish, or reckless, people didn't interact much, and even if they knew something, it was mostly hearsay. But these guys from the lower realm had been dealing with each other for years! They knew each other well!

Tiangu had studied Su Yu extensively, especially after the Immortal Race was defeated and forced to seal their realm. Tiangu probably spent all day pondering over Su Yu. Dealing with such familiar faces was not something Su Yu was keen on.

He glanced at Tiangu from the corner of his eye and smiled, "Brother Tiangu!"

"…"

Tiangu remained silent.

Su Yu was up to no good.

Sure enough, Su Yu's smile widened, "Brother Tiangu, in the lower realm, we often interacted. My rapid rise couldn't have happened without your help. I didn't expect that upon reaching the Upper Realm, you'd still be the decision-maker. Truly fortunate!"

As soon as he said this, Tiangu's eyes flickered, and he squinted slightly, "Human Lord Su, is this necessary?"

Would such a divisive tactic work?

Well, it had some effect.

Although Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others didn't speak, they were all pondering one thing: in the lower realm, Tiangu had always been in charge, yet he watched Su Yu rise and repeatedly suffer defeats. Su Yu's current status was indeed related to Tiangu. Perhaps Su Yu was formidable on his own, but it also indicated that Tiangu hadn't done well in the lower realm. Otherwise, Su Yu wouldn't have risen!

With just a few words, everyone began to question or consider whether they should agree with any decisions Tiangu might make next.

Tiangu knew Su Yu's tricks and calmly said, "Human Lord, won't you invite us in for a chat?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course! I wouldn't say anything if others came, but since you're here, Brother Tiangu, I must invite you in for a chat and treat you with courtesy!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others remained silent. Su Yu's attempt to sow discord was obvious, but sometimes, whether your intentions were clear or not didn't matter. What mattered was that people were indeed concerned.

...

In the Bamboo Mountain Hall.

Su Yu sat in the center, and the Heavenly Sovereigns each took their seats. Everyone's purpose for coming was clear. They came to discuss with Su Yu whether to join forces against the Control King's lineage or to fight separately.

At this moment, Moon Heavenly Venerable, seeing Su Yu remain silent, took the lead and smiled, "Last time, I met Human Lord Su, but I didn't know it was your true form…"

"Fake, isn't it?"

"…"

Su Yu's sudden interjection left Moon Heavenly Venerable speechless.

Su Yu calmly said, "Fake or not? You came to me to deal with the Sin Race, didn't you? Is there any point in pleasantries?"

"The reason I look down on the myriad races is precisely because of this; they can never grasp the main point!"

The Heavenly Sovereigns squinted, and Mo Heavenly Venerable, with his purple hair flying, said coldly, "Su Yu, don't forget, dealing with the Control King's lineage is also your demand!"

Su Yu remained calm, "It's my demand, but... I can hide. I don't have much at stake here. Can the Sin Race bite me? You all are different. If the Sin Race launches an attack, they will surely target the Upper Realm first. Will the strong of the Upper Realm retreat?"

Su Yu sneered, "Do you think I sealed the lower realm passage just to guard against Hundred Battle? Nonsense, I did it to prevent you from running away! As long as you don't run, you'll have to fight the Sin Race! Otherwise, two tigers can't share one mountain. Do you think the Sin Race will be polite to you?"

Hearing this, the others felt a bit uneasy. Su Yu had sealed the lower realm passage... with the intention of preventing them from escaping!

Damn this slippery guy!

Su Yu sneered, "In the Upper Realm, you can't escape, but I... can! Isn't that right? When Mo Heavenly Venerable and Moon Heavenly Venerable chased me in the River of Time, did you forget how I escaped? Even without the Fate Clan's passage, I can still run!"

"Thanks to you all, if it weren't for the large number of council tokens you provided, I wouldn't have been able to seal the passage so easily, right?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Now, the Upper Realm is just a small place. When the Sin Race's master of laws emerges, will they attack you or me first? I have no roots here; my roots are in the Death Realm. Even if they conquer it, they'll attack Hundred Battle first. What does that have to do with me?"

"…"

Tiangu raised an eyebrow slightly and said softly, "Human Lord, the Myriad Realms may not necessarily be our foundation. If it's destroyed..."

"Then let it be destroyed!"

Su Yu interrupted, smiling, "Tiangu, you know me! I'm someone who, to put it nicely, repays kindness! To put it bluntly, my people are in the Death Realm. Others have nothing to do with me. How many die has nothing to do with me, right? My responsibility and burden are for those willing to follow me. Those who aren't, aren't my people!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable took a deep breath, "Then what does the Human Lord mean?"

Su Yu smiled, "I have no particular meaning. I have only one goal: revenge! Retaliation! The Sin Race killed my people, so I naturally want revenge! Moreover, this race has been dormant for years, with no small ambition. They are traitors to the Human Race. If we can kill them, we kill them. If not, we retreat!"

The few exchanged glances, and Destiny Marquis smiled, "Human Lord!"

"Brother Destiny!"

Su Yu smiled broadly, "Brother Destiny, we're all family. Why speak as if we're strangers?"

Destiny's face stiffened, and Su Yu chuckled, "Brother Destiny, I had a great collaboration with Wuming in the lower realm. Wuming and I have a tacit understanding. We're family, so speak freely. No need for formalities!"

With these words, the others remained silent. Was this an attempt to cover up, or was Su Yu genuinely trying to harm Destiny? Regardless, they would need to be cautious of Destiny in the future. Of course, they already had this mindset, so it didn't make much difference now.

Su Yu chuckled, "Alright, you all have differing opinions and ideas! If I talk to each of you individually, it'll never end. Relying on you, I might as well kill on my own!"

"Of course, having your help would be even better!"

Su Yu calmly said, "Let me state my demands! It's simple: hand over Moon Luo and Moon Hao to us! As for the Sin Race, the strong ones we've detected seem to be just that so-called ancestor and five Heavenly Sovereigns! Of course, a true master of laws might appear soon!"

Su Yu licked his lips and smiled, "This master of laws... leave them to us! Is that enough?"

Su Yu grinned, "A master of laws, plus two powerful Heavenly Sovereigns! The myriad races only need to deal with that ancestor, three Heavenly Sovereigns, and over ten Heavenly Kings! If you still think this isn't feasible... then forget it, we'll take it slow!"

Hearing this, the others were shocked. Moon Heavenly Venerable's eyes flickered, "Is the Human Lord serious?"

He actually wanted to take on the master of laws!

This guy, is he crazy?

A true master of laws!

Such a strong figure, even if Sun Corona and Saint Marquis joined forces, it would be troublesome and could result in casualties. That's why the myriad races were so worried when they learned the other side intended to summon a master of laws.

But Su Yu... he wanted to handle it himself!

Su Yu laughed maniacally, "What's wrong? My strength is top-tier among Heavenly Sovereigns! With Fat Ball by my side, am I really afraid of a master of laws? Moon Hao is severely injured, and with March and the others joining forces, can't they handle those two?"

Su Yu chuckled, "The greater the effort, the greater the reward. I've always believed in that! If we kill a master of laws, her corpse, her treasures, her power of the Great Dao, everything she has, will be ours!"

The group exchanged glances, momentarily speechless.

It wasn't that Su Yu's conditions were harsh, but rather that he was taking on three major powerhouses at once. To be honest, it made everyone hesitate. This guy was taking on too much.

Dealing with a master of laws, being able to resist is one thing, suppressing is another, and killing... that's a whole different level!

Su Yu even wanted to kill the opponent. Just that alone, even with four Heavenly Sovereigns on his side, might not be achievable.

At this moment, Tiangu looked at Su Yu, slightly frowning as he asked, "How do you plan to deal with the Master of Rules on the opposing side? You and Fat Ball might not be enough. Do you have other reinforcements?"

Su Yu smiled brightly, "Care to guess?"

I won't guess!

Tiangu quickly assessed Su Yu's intentions. This guy never suffers a loss! However, the conditions Su Yu offered were indeed generous.

At this moment, Destiny Marquis spoke with some curiosity, "Does the Human Lord have no other demands?"

"Of course, I do!" Su Yu chuckled. "Killing the Master of Rules brings benefits after the fact. Before that, what benefits could there be?"

Su Yu, with a lion's appetite, laughed, "The reason I'm so agreeable is partly because the enemy is a common foe, and partly because I have some requests from the myriad races. I hope the myriad races can agree!"

Hearing this, everyone felt somewhat relieved.

Damn it! You scared us earlier. Are you really such a good person?

It's hard to believe!

The toughest bone to chew, and you, Su Yu, are willing to chew it. You really are selfless.

At this moment, Moon Heavenly Sovereign smiled, "May I ask what the Human Lord's demands are?"

Su Yu was not polite at all and directly stated, "First, all pseudo-dao experts should be at my disposal. After all, they're cannon fodder, and they have more value as my cannon fodder!"

"Second, all unused pseudo-dao power should be given to me. I can use it to enhance my strength!"

"Third, I remember the myriad races have a mountain of dung, refined into a treasure by someone. It should be given to me!"

"Fourth, all ancient beast corpses killed should be given to me. I have use for them!"

"Fifth, all previous council tokens should be handed over to me!"

"Sixth, the myriad races should provide me with ten thousand divine characters."

"Seventh..."

Su Yu continued listing his demands, and everyone listened without interrupting. When he was almost done, Tiangu softly asked, "Which of these does the Human Lord truly want?"

Su Yu laughed!

Looking at him, Tiangu spoke, "The mountain of dung you mentioned... I suspect it's the Dragon Coiling Divine Mountain, currently in the hands of the Dragon Sovereign, refined into his weapon! Few know about this. I believe this is one of the Human Lord's true objectives!"

"Moreover, it's impossible for you to get the pseudo-dao experts, which means the Human Lord might be more interested in those ownerless pseudo-daos!"

"And the council tokens, while useful, aren't of great significance to you! Perhaps the divine characters are more important to the Human Lord."

He analyzed each point, while Su Yu swiftly gathered intelligence.

The mountain of dung that Old Turtle needed was actually in the hands of the Dragon Heavenly Sovereign!

Great, crucial intelligence acquired!

This item must be obtained. If Old Turtle gets it, he can become a Heavenly Sovereign. This is essential and the top priority. As for the rest, honestly, whether they are obtained or not doesn't matter much!

If necessary, I'll just take it by force!

The main thing is the mountain of dung. Su Yu didn't even know where it was before, but now he does. Just this piece of information is worth everything!

Of course, Su Yu remained composed.

If he could get it directly, that would be best.

If not, then he'd take it by force!

Who wouldn't want something for free?

Tiangu, this troublemaker, was stirring things up again!

Su Yu wasn't afraid of his meddling. At this moment, he nodded slightly and smiled, "Brother Tiangu, you truly know me well. Everything you guessed is correct! What you mentioned is exactly what I want!"

Everyone exchanged strange glances. Damn it, what do you really want?

With Su Yu's words, everyone was uncertain again.

At this moment, Heavendoom Heavenly Sovereign frowned, "What if we don't give it? Would the Human Lord not deal with the Control King's lineage?"

Su Yu laughed, "Of course not! Dealing with them is a common enemy, how could we not? The key is... if it really comes to that, and the Master of Rules truly emerges, we might just stop fighting. We can't handle it!"

Everyone frowned, and Mo Heavenly Sovereign said solemnly, "You mean, if we give you the items, you'll be willing to deal with them. But how can we ensure that after giving you the items, you'll deal with the Master of Rules?"

"Also, if we intercept them now, can we prevent the Control King's lineage from summoning that Master of Rules?"

Su Yu nodded, "Good question. Actually, intercepting them now still holds a chance. The key is... the myriad races need to negotiate and discuss how to deal with the other side. This delay... honestly, by the time you're done, they might already be out! The probability of interception isn't high!"

"As for ensuring I'll deal with the Master of Rules after getting the items..."

Su Yu stroked his chin and smiled, "That's true, how to ensure it? How about... you give me some ideas?"

Just taking the money and not doing the work seems quite enjoyable!

Although Su Yu planned to let the Chaos Dragon and others handle it.

But isn't this just me getting benefits for them?

See how good I am!

Everyone exchanged glances, and Tiangu was straightforward, calmly saying, "It's simple. If a great war breaks out and the Master of Rules appears, the Human Lord can kill a Heavenly Sovereign first. Naturally, the Master of Rules will target the Human Lord! No need for excessive guidance!"

Su Yu laughed, "You mean you guys will just play a supporting role?"

Tiangu shook his head, "Not at all. It's just that the Human Lord excels at surprise attacks and swift kills. I believe the Human Lord can kill a Heavenly Sovereign faster!"

Su Yu laughed again, "And the benefits?"

Tiangu remained silent.

Let's not discuss that for now!

Su Yu laughed, "The myriad races... so indecisive! You want to cooperate but fear I'll take the benefits and not work! You don't want to cooperate but worry I'll stab you in the back! You guys, always overthinking!"

Su Yu shook his head, "Honestly, you guys are really not a concern. You can't accomplish anything significant! At critical moments, you always drop the ball. Just look at the Upper Realm, with so few ancient human experts... and you've been fighting for six thousand years without finishing them off!"

Su Yu sneered, "Why haven't you finished them off? Are they that strong? Not at all! It's because everyone worries about losing a few Daofuse experts. Killing them, what benefit does it bring to my race? Why should my race do it and not another?"

Su Yu kept shaking his head, "Even in death, it's the same situation! They say the human race has severe internal strife... I don't deny that, but the human race has also been unified before. The myriad races have never achieved that!"

Tiangu was silent for a moment, then calmly said, "You're right, but... isn't that normal? If we were willing to be led, we would have submitted to the human race back then. Why resist? Our resistance was to avoid being dominated! Now, you say all this, but if someone truly dominates us, why resist? We might as well let the human race lead again!"

Su Yu was taken aback!

This... makes so much sense!

Tiangu said solemnly, "Our alliance is because the human race is powerful, and we don't want to be trampled. Hence, the myriad races alliance! The Human Lord thinks we're too chaotic, but he's wrong. Each race is united within itself. Chaos only arises for the benefit of the race! At least within our race, we can quickly reach a consensus, something the human race can't match!"

Su Yu stroked his chin, "But your situation doesn't seem too good right now. Aren't you afraid of trouble?"

Tiangu replied seriously, "Co-governance and alliance are the foundation of this alliance! The Human Lord's idea is wrong! Dictatorship is the root of our resistance! If we become dictators now, we've lost the essence of our resistance!"

"We know the drawbacks, but once we become dictators, I'll think, he'll think, if we're all being ruled, why not become vassals of the God, Demon, and Immortal races instead of the human race?"

"Of course, we don't deny having such thoughts, but... until we reach a consensus, they're just thoughts!"

The three major races all wanted dictatorship, provided they could smoothly transition to become the second human race.

Otherwise, they could only remain allied!

No dictators could emerge!

Otherwise, it would violate their principles. Why resist the human race back then?

When the human race was unified, they weren't overly harsh on the myriad races.

Finding another leader was worse than sticking with the original one!

At this moment, Su Yu also fell into deep thought. He always thought the myriad races lacked a dictator, a decisive leader, but Tiangu's words suddenly made him realize!

Yes!

If the myriad races had a dictator, wouldn't that just be the second human race?

Everyone wants it, but no one can achieve it, so they might as well maintain the alliance.

At this moment, Su Yu finally understood!

He suddenly realized, "I see, no one is perfect. I was considering the myriad races from my perspective. No wonder! I thought your control over the myriad races wasn't strong. It turns out... there's a possibility that if pushed too hard, others might return to the human race's embrace!"

Su Yu laughed, "So, you're already quite unified. At least at the top level, you can generally reach a consensus!"

At this moment, Tiangu's words indeed enlightened Su Yu.

The myriad races aren't incapable of unifying, but unifying would be more troublesome. Each race never intended to submit to others; otherwise, there was no need to oppose the human race.

He realized he had thought too little!

Tiangu and the others didn't care whether Su Yu understood or not.

His criticism of the myriad races' policies was actually due to his own lack of thought.

The three major races maintaining this situation was already quite enlightened, with the high levels of each race reaching a consensus, which was quite rare.

Su Yu laughed, "Alright, I won't say your policies are wrong anymore. It's just that fundamentally, you don't support dictatorship! So, can you agree to the conditions I proposed earlier? If you agree, no problem. You say when to start, and we'll start immediately! I'll be the vanguard, and you just follow. Don't retreat when I start, or I'll be in trouble!"

"If you don't agree... then we'll just fight our own battles!"

Should Su Yu take the lead, or should everyone act independently? This was the main reason everyone had gathered here.

Moon Heavenly Venerable spoke softly, "Human Lord Su, your demands are too many and impossible to fulfill. Just tell us what you want most, and we might consider it."

Su Yu thought for a moment, then smiled, "Let me simplify it for you: three conditions—Mount Shit, pseudo-dao power, and ten thousand divine characters. Didn't Tiangu already help me choose? Agree to these three, and I'll have no objections. We'll get started immediately!"

Tiangu was speechless. At this moment, he wondered if Su Yu truly wanted these things or if he was just using them as an excuse. Perhaps, even without these, Su Yu would still be willing to join forces. It was a headache! Su Yu was always so unpredictable!

Su Yu chuckled, "Everyone, time waits for no one! I suspect the Sin Clan is already working overtime, rapidly summoning their master of laws. Do we really have to wait until their forces are fully gathered before we act? Aren't you being too rigid? Can't we strike while they're still in the process of summoning, catching them off guard?"

He continued with a hint of exasperation, "Even if we can't interrupt them, we should seize this opportunity to kill more of them, making them pay a higher price! The time we've spent discussing this could have been used to kill a few more of their Heavenly Venerables!"

"Moreover, five Heavenly Venerables might not be all they have! In ten thousand years, have they really only produced five Heavenly Venerables? Fine, even if I killed one, that makes six. In ten thousand years, how many Heavenly Venerables have the myriad races and the human race produced?"

Su Yu calculated, "With our constant battles, the number of dead and living Heavenly Venerables has exceeded twenty! Why assume they only have five left? Your intelligence system is worthless!"

He shook his head, "You insist on waiting, dragging things out until their master of laws is fully recovered and emerges, and only then do you gather your forces to die? I just can't understand it!"

He truly couldn't understand what the myriad races were thinking. Even without a dictator, they should know to strike when the enemy is weak!

Moon Heavenly Venerable sighed, "Perhaps the Human Lord is right, but... it's just a habit."

Su Yu sneered, "A habit of waiting to die?"

"You people are always forced to wait. Scholars revolt, and it takes three years to fail; you've been at it for thirty thousand years and still haven't succeeded! As far as I know, when you rebelled against the human race, you held many meetings, and in the end, it was the Human Emperor who took your strong ones away..."

Su Yu sneered, "If I were the Human Emperor, I wouldn't have taken you away! The Human Emperor was in a hurry, but he shouldn't have been. With the way you myriad races are, you wouldn't have rebelled without discussing it for a thousand or eight hundred years!"

Is that possible? Yes!

The Culture King and Martial King had been missing for a while, and the myriad races had held several discussions without making a decision. The Human Emperor taking them away actually made the myriad races resolve to rebel.

Otherwise, as Su Yu said, they might not have rebelled quickly.

Is a thousand years long? Perhaps even after a thousand years, they wouldn't have rebelled!

The Human Emperor had the time to open more Great Daos, making them stronger, and could have taken his own Great Dao away, rather than leaving it behind like this!

These words were harsh but not without reason.

The Heavenly Venerables said nothing, but upon reflection, if the Human Emperor hadn't acted, would the myriad races' master of laws have really taken a thousand or eight hundred years to decide?

If so... it only showed that Su Yu's insight was sharp.

At this moment, Tiangu spoke again, "We can give you pseudo-dao power, but nothing else! We don't have divine characters, and Dragon Coiling Mountain is a Heavenly Venerable weapon; we can't give it to you..."

He paused, then said solemnly, "I don't know why you want Dragon Coiling Mountain, but we must agree that you won't act against Dragon Heavenly Venerable before the Control King's lineage is destroyed!"

Su Yu laughed, "Tiangu, do you think I'm that kind of person?"

Yes! Tiangu knew in his heart that he might have made a mistake by telling Su Yu that Dragon Coiling Mountain was in someone's possession. Su Yu might not have known before.

Of course, this mistake couldn't be addressed now. It couldn't be emphasized, lest Dragon Heavenly Venerable think it was intentional. Tiangu had only mentioned it subconsciously, not realizing that Su Yu might not know where it was.

Su Yu had laid out a bunch of conditions, but Tiangu only agreed to one.

Su Yu said flatly, "Too little! If you say there's only one unowned pseudo-dao, then what's there to talk about?"

Tiangu nodded, "Not mentioning the quantity is indeed inappropriate! Ten pseudo-daos, all with Daofuse power, how about that?"

Su Yu frowned at him, "Can you represent the myriad races?"

"We can negotiate!"

Tiangu looked at Su Yu, "Human Lord, there's no need to sow discord. The former Empress and Demon Halberd are here, and we know your ways! Moreover, the three major races and other races are aware of the imminent danger and won't turn against each other because of a few words from you!"

Su Yu sighed, "I shouldn't have brought you up here!"

Tiangu smiled, "It's the same. The Upper Realm will soon see through the Human Lord's true nature!"

"You're making me sound like a demon!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "I'm just a young man in my twenties, impulsive and nothing else. Tiangu, you really think highly of me!"

Tiangu remained silent. His silence reminded everyone of something they hadn't considered. This guy was too young, and being more cautious was necessary.

Su Yu finally sighed, "Fine, twenty Daofuse pseudo-daos, give them to me, and I'll be your vanguard! We can start the fight anytime, preferably within three days! Otherwise, the opportunity will be missed, and I'll be worried for you!"

The group exchanged glances, and Moon Heavenly Venerable quickly said, "Three days... no, within one day, we'll give the Human Lord an answer!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

The group said no more, quickly rising to leave, but Su Yu smiled, "Destiny, let's chat for a bit. Why the rush?"

Destiny awkwardly replied, "No, thank you for your hospitality, Human Lord!"

With that, he hurriedly left.

In his heart, he was thinking of something else. Soon, he transmitted to several strong individuals, "He's doing it on purpose. Don't misunderstand! The matter of Wuming is still uncertain! By doing this, he's creating distrust, which isn't good!"

The group nodded. As for whether they were suspicious, that was something each kept to themselves!

...

Once they left, Su Yu narrowed his eyes.

Dragon Heavenly Venerable!

Find a chance to kill him!

This time, if nothing else, Dragon Coiling Mountain is quite good.

"Mount Shit is in Dragon Heavenly Venerable's hands. If I don't kill him... it's not impossible, just rob him!"

Robbing a weapon doesn't necessarily mean killing someone!

Su Yu stroked his chin and suddenly said, "Tongtian, keep an eye on Dragon Heavenly Venerable. It's best to find a chance to strike now and forcibly rob him!"

Everyone was stunned!

What was that?

Su Yu squinted, "Rob him now, and even if they get angry, they won't turn against us! No one would expect me to rob someone now! This is called catching them off guard!"

Yes, who would think Su Yu would rob someone now? They had just discussed cooperation!

Su Yu chuckled, "It's worth it! If I get Dragon Coiling Mountain, Hongmeng can likely enter the Heavenly Venerable realm. With one more Heavenly Venerable, do I care about offending them? It's bound to happen sooner or later! It's best to rob them while they can't turn against us!"

Goodness!

The group secretly complained. You're really something!

They were still discussing cooperation here, and over there, you were already planning a robbery!

Marquis Tongtian grinned, and Su Yu continued, "Wait... let me think... right after they agree to cooperate and decide on the battle time, we'll rob Dragon Heavenly Venerable and immediately go to war with the Control King's lineage!"

Su Yu laughed, "I'll be the vanguard then. Even if the myriad races are unhappy, will they attack me at that moment? That would be truly foolish! So, they'll have to accept it!"

Yes, that's the timing!

The group exchanged glances and nodded. Alright!

Still following Su Yu's lead!

Look, the Control King's lineage hasn't even been fought yet, and he's already preparing to rob a Heavenly Venerable.

Marquis Tongtian couldn't help but ask, "Then... what about the Eight-Winged Tiger and their side?"

"No worries, the summoning will definitely succeed!"

Su Yu was confident, and the others looked at him uncertainly. Why say that?

Su Yu laughed, "The Eight-Winged Tiger is a big liar. If he wasn't sure that the master of laws would appear, he wouldn't have told me the truth. Since he said it, it means one thing: the other side is about to appear!"

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked.

March couldn't help but say, "Your Majesty means that the Eight-Winged Tiger... actually deliberately gave the wrong time. He said it would be in a few days, but it's actually happening soon!"

"Of course!"

Su Yu laughed, "Of course, they hope the master of laws will appear. How could they let us know so soon, causing the other side not to appear! Earlier, when I tested the Control King's lineage, only Moon Luo and Moon Hao appeared, and later only an old ancestor of the Control King came... Do you think the other Heavenly Venerables, with such a big event, are still sleeping at home?"

Su Yu was speechless!

"Can't you think? Those few must be at a critical moment and can't leave! Otherwise, how dare this lineage let two Heavenly Venerables deal with our four? They had no choice, so they did it!"

"..."

The group looked at each other, and Giant Axe remained serious, saying nothing, pretending to have figured it out!

As for whether they had figured it out, everyone knew in their hearts.

Sorry, we really didn't think much!

So, the Control King's lineage wasn't underestimating us; they really couldn't bring out so many strong ones at once, right?

They thought the other side was underestimating them!

Seeing this, Su Yu couldn't be bothered to say more.

These people were gradually becoming like Heavendoom!

Warriors, there would only be more and more.

Originally, they weren't, but surrounded by a group of warriors, they would eventually become one!

How sad!

He no longer cared about these people pretending to know themselves and fell into deep thought. Would there be any changes this time?

When would those people deep in chaos make their move?

And... was Hundred Battle really content to stay in the lower realm?

Would I be content if it were me?

Absolutely not!

And those two ancient beasts, do they really trust me that much?

Nonsense!

Therefore, this time, there will definitely be unexpected changes. It won't go as smoothly as planned.

"So, some things require a backup plan!"

Su Yu muttered to himself, quickly refining his next steps.

P.S.: The third update has been around 10:30 recently. I won't mention it next time. I'll revert to around 9:00 and will notify you. 

(End of Chapter)
