Chapter 802: Unforeseen Changes

Tiangu, this guy really knows how to focus on the key points. Or perhaps, is he overestimating Su Yu?

The matter of unsealing something that hasn't been possible for a hundred thousand years—he talks as if I can unseal it immediately... Well, I can, since the Heavenly Overseer Marquis is in my hands!

Su Yu quickly calculated. Unsealing... If unsealed, March, Destiny, and Giant Axe might have a chance to advance to the Heavenly Sovereign... No, if January is still alive, March is following January's path, so March can't advance.

As for Destiny and Giant Axe, Su Yu hadn't asked if they were following the path of the original rulers of laws. As for Fat Ball and Tongtian, they can't advance; their combat power is there, but their realm isn't.

Others who have merged into my Great Dao also have no hope. However, if Hongmeng comprehends the Divine Mountain and steps into the Heavenly Sovereign, he could become a ruler of laws, as Hongmeng's Dao partner has fallen, leaving that path untraveled.

So, at most, three or four rulers of laws might emerge under my command. As for the myriad races, it's hard to say. The Hundred Battle side is also uncertain about how many have taken the path of the rulers of laws, and whether those rulers are still alive. If they are... the numbers are unpredictable.

Overall, unsealing doesn't help Su Yu much. Instead, it might strengthen the opposing forces!

At this moment, Su Yu fell into deep thought. Unsealing is necessary, but not now. Not unsealing means no new rulers of laws can emerge in the Myriad Realms, which isn't good. The timing, however, must be judged by Su Yu himself.

"Yue Luo, White Hair, and Thunderstorm are all people of the Hundred Battle. In this battle, the Hundred Battle side hasn't made a move at all!"

Although Su Yu had sealed the lower realm, he didn't believe the Hundred Battle side had no means at all. Various thoughts surfaced in Su Yu's mind.

At this moment, Su Yu looked up at the opposite side. On the opposite side, Yu Qing and others were also watching Su Yu. Yu Qing seemed to have noticed Su Yu and Tiangu's communication and slightly frowned, saying, "Moreover, according to Su Yu, if it's true, it means there's another powerful existence coveting us! At this time, even if we fight to the death, wouldn't it benefit others?"

Her attitude was completely different from before. Ceasefire! Whether Su Yu's words were true or false, a ceasefire might be the best choice. A ceasefire could give her more time and preparation.

Yu Qing continued, "Su Yu, you said it yourself, this so-called Zhou Ji is also a ruler of laws. If we don't ceasefire now, are you sure you want to let the other side take advantage?"

She was no longer cold, but showed a faint smile. "You are not afraid of me now because you have many Heavenly Sovereigns. Once several Heavenly Sovereigns die in battle, there will be no deterrent against the rulers of laws!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. "You make a good point."

As soon as he said this, some people secretly breathed a sigh of relief, while others felt a bit regretful. It was over! Clearly, Su Yu thought a ceasefire was possible.

However, at this moment, Su Yu suddenly said playfully, "Yu Qing, do you mind if we play a little game?"

Yu Qing looked at Su Yu, slightly frowning. Su Yu said calmly, "Just a little game, dare you?"

Yu Qing raised an eyebrow. "Speak!"

Su Yu said calmly, "I think not enough Heavenly Sovereigns have died today! Too few! Not fun! Now, your side's White Hair and Yue Luo, two Heavenly Sovereigns, come out to fight. I and the myriad races each send one Heavenly Sovereign to fight the two, deciding life and death! With the death of two Heavenly Sovereigns, this battle ends. What do you think?"

As soon as these words came out, everyone changed color. The white-haired elder shouted angrily, "Su Yu, you..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, his aura overwhelming. "It's not your place to speak here!"

Su Yu said coldly, "This is not a place for you to refute or give opinions! Since Yu Qing is here, let Yu Qing decide! On my side, Thunderstorm will fight! On the myriad races' side..."

Su Yu scanned the crowd, looking at Tiangu. Tiangu raised an eyebrow slightly; Su Yu hadn't answered his question yet. But at this moment... he seemed to understand Su Yu's meaning. His eyes flickered, and he said, "How about Destiny?"

Su Yu smiled, "Not bad!"

Alright. Tiangu understood, indeed, Thunderstorm wasn't Su Yu's person, but Destiny certainly was!

Su Yu smiled and looked at the several Heavenly Sovereigns of the myriad races, finally looking towards the Chaos Dragon side, then at the Eight-Winged Tiger, and said with a smile, "How about the Eight-Winged Tiger and Thunderstorm against Yue Luo and White Hair Ghost?"

He looked at Yu Qing, smiling, "As a leader, just for fun! Yu Qing, if you don't show us your strength, your side is almost extinct. Why should we retreat? This way, if it's a tie, we'll ceasefire! If I win both battles... we'll continue until you're wiped out! If we lose... you decide whether to continue or ceasefire!"

Yu Qing's face didn't look good. What was this?

Su Yu smiled, "Don't want to play? Sometimes... it's worth a gamble. Maybe even if you lose, there's actually no loss!"

Yu Qing thought of Su Yu's previous words. Yue Luo and the white-haired elder were traitors. Is it possible? At this moment, Yu Qing quickly recalled everything. Is there such a possibility?

She was still thinking when the Eight-Winged Tiger was a bit unwilling, "Emperor Yu, why should I participate?"

Su Yu smiled, "Because you're weak! You're the weakest on your side! You've been a bystander until now, not contributing at all. How can that be? If we really ceasefire, we won't care about you anymore. Do you want to fight Yu Qing?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger was speechless. Damn it! Isn't it you who ruined our plan!

Su Yu looked at Yu Qing again, smiling, "Play or not, if you want to play, then hurry up. If not... let's discuss whether to retreat! Yue is very strong. I see she's not weaker than Yue Zhan. How about... Thunderstorm fights Yue Luo, let's see who wins?"

"Thunderstorm isn't strong, just an ordinary Heavenly Sovereign!"

Beside Su Yu, Thunderstorm's eyes changed. I knew it! I guessed I was going to be unlucky, and indeed, I am unlucky. He glanced at Su Yu from the corner of his eye. Aren't you afraid... that I'll reveal your secret of having your own world?

Su Yu wasn't afraid! To be honest, if it was really revealed... then let it be! He deliberately showed Thunderstorm to intimidate this guy. If Thunderstorm spread it, it would also intimidate Hundred Battle. Moreover, if Hundred Battle's son was really in chaos, he might know!

When many people know, a secret is no longer a secret. At this moment, Su Yu wanted to force out people from the Hundred Battle side, or let everyone know that this side is powerful. Otherwise, wouldn't it benefit Hundred Battle?

Even if they don't come out, killing Yue Luo and the others would weaken the Hundred Battle side, which is good. Now the myriad races are hesitant, but Su Yu doesn't let their people fight. It's none of their business, so they won't refuse Su Yu's proposal. Whether it's Thunderstorm or the Eight-Winged Tiger fighting, it has nothing to do with them. If they really die, it won't affect the overall situation.

...

At this time, Yu Qing looked back. Seven Heavenly Sovereigns! She looked at Yue Luo, who seemed pitiful, and White Hair, who seemed indignant. Yu Qing suddenly transmitted, "Are you confident?"

"..."

Yue Luo and White Hair's hearts trembled. Yu Qing transmitted, "Are you confident in killing Thunderstorm and Eight-Winged? Even if not... are you confident in saving your life? Yue Luo, your strength is not weak. If you face Thunderstorm, you should be able to easily defeat or even kill him, right?"

Yue Luo hesitated, but quickly transmitted, "Supreme, I... should be able to!"

"Yue Xiao, what about you?"

The white-haired elder had a name. Yue Xiao!

Yue Xiao quickly said, "Supreme, I... my Gate of Hell exploded, I'm seriously injured. Facing the Eight-Winged Tiger, I'm afraid... I'm afraid I won't survive!"

"Injured?"

Yu Qing nodded slightly, "Your combat power has indeed declined a lot. No matter, I'll give you some treasures, and you can recover most of it. The Eight-Winged Tiger is not weak, but you can still contend... I can agree with Su Yu on a time limit, and the battle must end within that time! It doesn't necessarily have to be a life-and-death battle... Yue Luo, how long do you think it will take to kill Thunderstorm?"

Yue Luo's heart moved, and after a while, she said, "One incense stick's time!"

"Then one incense stick's time! Yue Xiao, you can hold on. The Eight-Winged Tiger won't fight to the death! In this way, killing one of their Heavenly Sovereigns, why not?"

Su Yu's side feels like they're sending someone to die. As for Yue Xiao, if he really gets killed... then let him be killed. He's injured, seriously injured. Otherwise, if Su Yu and the others keep pestering, once he joins the battle, he might die too. It's better to create more value now!

Moreover, Yu Qing was also thinking about how much of Su Yu's words were true and how much were false. If true, then even if Yue Luo and Yue Xiao both die, it's not a loss! Spies! Yu Qing didn't dare to think deeply. Two Heavenly Sovereigns, if both were captured, what a terrifying thing it would be. They're all close people! They're all the core strength of the Holy Race! Especially with the fall of Sword Servant and others, and Yue Hao's death in battle, Yue Luo and the others' status and importance would be even higher! If they have problems, that's the trouble. The entire Holy Race, how many core secrets, these two people know, it's too scary.

...

Su Yu squinted and transmitted to Thunderstorm, "Will you sacrifice yourself for Yue Luo? Or do you think the Hundred Battle people will come to save you now?"

Thunderstorm was silent. Su Yu continued, "Then do you think Yu Qing will agree? She doesn't have many Heavenly Sovereigns left, maybe she won't agree!"

Su Yu smiled and suddenly said, "Yu Qing, if you're willing to play... I stipulate that two Heavenly Sovereigns must die to end it! Don't come with serious injuries, mutual destruction, and a draw! That's boring! There must be life and death!"

Yu Qing raised an eyebrow slightly, "Are you sure?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course! Two Heavenly Sovereigns dying, don't you think it's interesting?"

"Su Yu!"

Yu Qing said faintly, "Aren't you worried that by doing this, you'll make Thunderstorm and Eight-Winged dissatisfied?"

Su Yu chuckled, "How could that be! Besides... if they're dissatisfied, so be it! What, if the ruler demands the minister's death, would they dare resist?"

Su Yu's voice turned cold, "Or are you saying you have no control over this criminal race? If so, your role as the master of rules is quite wasted!"

Su Yu's words often caught people off guard. At this moment, he was actually using this method to determine the course of the war.

Would Thunderstorm resist? Would Moon Luo? Would the Eight-Winged Tiger?

Su Yu smiled, "Or perhaps... it doesn't have to be Thunderstorm against Moon Luo. That's not very exciting. How about Eight-Wings against Moon Luo, and Thunderstorm against the White-Haired Ghost? That would be more entertaining!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger nearly cursed Su Yu's entire family!

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "This way, the outcome is unpredictable. Both sides might lose two Heavenly Venerables, which would make it all the more interesting, wouldn't it? When the battle gets intense, maybe they'll self-destruct, and all four Heavenly Venerables could die... that would be a perfect ending to this battle!"

Yuqing pondered continuously and suddenly nodded, saying in a deep voice, "Fine! Su Yu, if you want to play, I'll accompany you! But if we win, this battle should cease!"

"Of course!"

Su Yu laughed, "If we win... then your side will probably be powerless to resist!"

He looked towards Tiangu and the others, smiling, "If we win, everyone, let's wipe out the criminal race together, so we won't have to live in fear. How about it?"

Tiangu was silent for a moment before nodding, "My Immortal Clan has no objections!"

The God Empress's eyes flickered, "My God Clan also has no objections!"

The three Heavenly Venerables of the Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether Clans naturally had no objections either. Besides, even if they did, it wouldn't matter at this moment.

Not having to fight to the death was actually quite nice.

"Thunderstorm, Eight-Wings... go forth!"

Su Yu's aura was powerful, intimidating them. Over there, the myriad races' experts were all silently watching.

Thunderstorm's expression changed unpredictably, and the Eight-Winged Tiger was somewhat reluctant, looking at Su Yu. Su Yu smiled, "Originally, you were to fight the master of rules, but now you only need to fight Moon Luo, which is less dangerous... I promise, if you kill Moon Luo, I'll continue to lead people into battle. Yuqing will be left to us, and if we kill Yuqing, I'll gift you her chaotic will! To gain, you must give. At least this is less than what you had to give before!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger's heart stirred slightly, "Then... Emperor Yu... will you keep your word?"

Su Yu said indifferently, "At this moment, I wouldn't break my word for a chaotic will! If you don't believe me, then forget it. Do you expect me to give you some guarantee?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger gritted its teeth and quickly leaped out, "Fine, then I'll fight. If I kill Moon Luo... I hope Emperor Yu won't break his word. I also believe that with Emperor Yu's status, you wouldn't break your word over this!"

What status?

Not the status of the Human Lord!

But the status of the Opener of the Heavens.

With such a status, breaking your word over a bit of chaotic will would be too disgraceful, causing the myriad races and your subordinates to look down on you.

Su Yu laughed!

"Of course!"

At this moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger had no objections. Thunderstorm looked at Su Yu, hesitating several times...

He wanted to say that there was no deep-seated hatred between Hundred Battle and Su Yu, so why bother?

But... he couldn't say it.

Thunderstorm's eyes were complicated.

Only the death of two Heavenly Venerables would bring a ceasefire.

Who would die?

No matter who died, it wouldn't affect Su Yu, not in the slightest!

For the myriad races, it actually didn't matter either.

As for the Control King's lineage, now that Yuqing had agreed, it meant Yuqing was somewhat suspicious.

Among the four Heavenly Venerables, three were Hundred Battle's people, and one was from the Chaos Ancient Clan. Even if they all died, it wouldn't affect everyone. The one who would lose the most was actually Hundred Battle.

Was this considered internal strife?

Moon Luo and Moon Howl had been dormant for many years, and before they could do anything, they were disrupted by this bastard Su Yu.

At this moment, Moon Luo and Moon Howl were also filled with countless thoughts.

What to do?

Fight?

But Yuqing was watching, everyone was watching. If they didn't fight now...

Moon Luo transmitted a message to Moon Battle, her voice soft, "Ancestor, we already have fewer Heavenly Venerables than the other side. If something happens to Moon Howl and me... we might as well fight now!"

She then transmitted to Yuqing, "Supreme, Su Yu actually harbors ill intentions. He's deliberately trying to weaken our strength. I'm not as strong as Eight-Wings, and the injured Moon Howl may not be able to match Thunderstorm. If we both die, Su Yu will surely launch a full-scale attack! At that time, we'll be even more disadvantaged..."

"I know the Supreme might have been influenced by Su Yu's previous words, but Moon Howl and I are both direct descendants of our ancestors... how could we betray the Holy Clan? Su Yu is clearly trying to sow discord!"

She didn't want to fight!

"Supreme, if we die, it will be even harder for us afterward..."

Yuqing's face remained calm, looking at them, and suddenly transmitted, "If you truly fall... consider it a sacrifice for the Holy Clan! Even if you die, you must self-destruct to kill the enemy, drag them down with you... don't forget, the Gate of Hell... has a crack! Since I can come out, then... everyone can come out too!"

Upon hearing this, Moon Battle and the others were all shaken!

Yuqing was extremely calm, transmitting, "If several Heavenly Venerables die, we can summon another one out, whether it's an ancient beast or a Holy Clan member. Our strength will not weaken! Moon Luo, Moon Howl, it's best if you win, but if you lose... consider it a sacrifice for the Holy Clan!"

In short, if you die, the Holy Clan won't lose out!

So, regardless of life or death, you must fight.

At this moment, Moon Luo fully understood Yuqing's meaning. If we die, then use our power, the power of death, to summon another strong one back. If we kill the opponent, even better, as it will accumulate power for summoning a strong one!

Moon Luo's heart trembled slightly, the Gate of Hell... could still summon strong ones!

At this point, with things said to this extent, there was no retreat!

Moon Luo was silent for a moment, then nodded, looking at Moon Howl, and together they walked out.

Since that's the case... there's no choice!

...

At the same time, Su Yu suddenly transmitted to Yuqing, "Be careful they don't run! Later, you might see something very interesting, of course, it doesn't rule out them sacrificing themselves... hahaha!"

Yuqing didn't respond.

And at this moment, the four great experts all stepped out.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was still muttering, "Am I to deal with Moon Luo? If I kill her, Yuqing won't intervene, right?"

He deliberately glanced at Yuqing, then at Su Yu, "Emperor Yu, if I kill Moon Luo, what if this woman intervenes?"

"Kill!"

Su Yu said calmly, "If she intervenes, then she's not following the rules. Would the myriad races believe she wouldn't break them one by one? So, we can only fight. If Yuqing really makes such a choice, it would save us from hesitating. It's a good thing!"

Exactly!

The key is, you're not the one going into battle!

The Eight-Winged Tiger cursed inwardly!

Su Yu, truly wicked.

Wicked to the core!

At this moment, the four great experts walked to the front.

Su Yu's voice rang out again, with a playful tone, "Decide life and death! If it's not decided within an hour, we'll step in and help you decide!"

The experts didn't make a sound.

If Thunderstorm and the Eight-Winged Tiger were his own people, Su Yu playing like this would be too hurtful.

But... they're not!

Since that's the case, Su Yu didn't mind being the big villain.

Neither side said anything, Thunderstorm and Moon Howl walked to one side, Moon Luo looked at the Eight-Winged Tiger, her face no longer smiling, but somewhat somber.

Su Yu!

Beast!

There was nothing Su Yu wouldn't dare to do or wouldn't do.

The four great experts, their auras erupted.

The four Heavenly Venerables were all very powerful at this moment.

The battle was on the verge of breaking out.

The next moment, Moon Luo shouted, and in an instant, a piercing sound, with a special frequency, spread across the world.

Many people's eardrums shook, feeling dizzy.

"Go!"

A low shout, and in an instant, Moon Luo and Moon Howl broke through the air, fleeing instantly!

Yes, Moon Luo chose to flee.

At this moment, she no longer chose to disguise.

Su Yu was too treacherous!

If they really fought to the death with the Eight-Winged Tiger, Su Yu might still have tricks waiting for them. Even if she could kill the Eight-Winged Tiger, there would be no good outcome. In that case, it was better to escape while they still had strength!

Moon Howl was also extremely fast, escaping in the blink of an eye.

Thunderstorm was about to flee, but suddenly his eyes flickered, and he quickly stopped.

He couldn't leave!

If he left, the giants in the Upper Realm would be finished, and with Moon Luo and the others fleeing, his side was actually not in much danger. What if the myriad races knew he was with Hundred Battle?

Su Yu already knew!

He was different from Moon Luo and the others; they were considered rebels, but he was not. The giants were an independent race, not anyone's rebels. Tiangu and the others even chose to cooperate with Su Yu, so cooperating with Hundred Battle wasn't unacceptable.

So at this moment, Thunderstorm chose to stop.

He wasn't part of the Control King's lineage!

So, he could stay.

But Moon Luo and Moon Howl were extremely fast, tearing through space and fleeing towards the depths of chaos.

Yuqing's face changed slightly, wanting to take action!

They escaped!

They actually escaped!

Damn it!

Although Su Yu had reminded her earlier, she was actually doubtful about Moon Luo and Moon Howl defecting to Hundred Battle. Was it true?

Now, reality told her, it was true!

At this moment, Yuqing's face was extremely ugly, but Su Yu laughed. The next moment, he shouted, "Kill those two!"

With that, he led his people, quickly rushing towards that side!

Tiangu and the others were actually all dazed, but Tiangu had some guesses before, just didn't expect Moon Luo and the others to escape so decisively.

In an instant, a group of people all chased after them!

Including Yuqing and the others, with changing expressions, quickly followed.

Whether or not to kill Moon Luo and the others was another matter, but at this moment, they had to follow. Now, Yuqing truly had countless thoughts in her mind, trouble!

Moon Luo and Moon Howl actually escaped!

Suddenly, she was down two Heavenly Venerables.

...

At the same time.

Su Yu quickly transmitted a message, "The pursuit is a ruse. The goal is to lure out Yu Qing and the others. We can't keep killing here, or we might provoke stronger beings from the Gate of Hell. We need to move away from this place and join forces against Yu Qing! Even if we can't kill Yu Qing, taking down those Heavenly Venerables will leave her vulnerable."

Tiangu cursed under his breath, "What a schemer!" Su Yu was always up to something.

At this moment, Su Yu was in high spirits. If they ran, it was good; if they didn't, that would be troublesome. Since they were fleeing... and heading deeper into the chaos, it meant someone might really be there to meet them—perhaps that Zhou Ji!

He quickly led his group in pursuit, determined to kill them. "They must be going to meet Zhou Ji. Zhou Ji is deep within the chaos. We must not let them join forces... Hundred Battle's side is already strong. If they gain two more Heavenly Venerables, they'll be even stronger. No matter what, we must kill them!"

Su Yu continued to shout, "Yu Qing, aren't these your traitors? As a master of laws, can't you catch them?"

Behind, Yu Qing and her group followed, but not too quickly. Hearing this, she frowned slightly but said nothing. If she really wanted to chase them, she could catch up. However, she was somewhat hesitant. She even considered not pursuing them and returning immediately to defend the Holy Clan's territory.

But if she didn't chase them and Yue Luo and the others really joined forces with Zhou Ji, and if Su Yu's group reached some agreement with them... then defending the territory might be a bad move.

"Perhaps... there's a chance for cooperation!"

At this point, Yu Qing knew that Yue Luo's betrayal was a significant problem. If Zhou Ji truly had the strength of a master of laws... perhaps they could cooperate! First, she needed to stabilize her side.

The group quickly flew deeper into the chaos. Ahead, Yue Luo and Yue Xiao fled at high speed, no longer caring about anything else. Yue Luo's face was grim. Su Yu! She remembered him! She should have killed Su Yu long ago, but Hundred Battle insisted that he couldn't be killed, at least not now. As a result, while Hundred Battle hesitated, Su Yu acted without restraint.

"Hurry!" Yue Luo grabbed Yue Xiao, who had been injured earlier and was slowing down. This worried Yue Luo, so she quickly pulled him along, fleeing madly into the depths.

...

Meanwhile, at the rear, Su Yu led his group in pursuit. He quickly transmitted messages to various parties, "Tiangu, former consort, we'll deal with Yu Qing! You have so many people; deal with Yue Zhan and his group. Including the demons, there are only five of them! If you can't kill them all, the trouble won't be mine! The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger will handle Yue Zhan. The myriad races will deal with the demons and the twins. If you still can't kill them... you might as well die yourselves!"

"The situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, but the danger isn't mine!"

No one responded. The next moment, Su Yu turned and swung a hammer, shouting, "Kill!"

Boom!

Yu Qing thrust her spear, shattering Su Yu's hammer with a loud crash. She frowned, "Indeed! Su Yu, you're foolish. By doing this, you're only benefiting others. You know how strong Hundred Battle's side is. Unless you're willing to submit... at this moment, you and I should join forces!"

"Heh, I don't care about that!"

In an instant, Su Yu's side, consisting of six strong individuals, moved swiftly to attack Yu Qing. Yu Qing's expression changed slightly. Were these bastards really going to let others benefit?

She felt that with Hundred Battle's forces emerging, Su Yu shouldn't be making a move now. What was this idiot thinking? But she also knew that a crisis was at hand! They were short two Heavenly Venerables! Damn it!

"Retreat!" Yu Qing quickly retreated. She was fast, but the others weren't, and in an instant, they were caught up. The Chaos Dragon, this time, wasn't slow, breaking through the air in an instant!

Its tail swung towards Yue Zhan!

The Eight-Winged Tiger also roared. They didn't care much; they were all enemies. It didn't matter who died. The fewer, the better. With fewer strong individuals under Yu Qing, they had a chance.

These two ancient beasts were prepared to challenge a master of laws, and their strength was stronger than expected. The Chaos Dragon alone managed to push Yue Zhan back a few steps with a tail swipe.

At this moment, the Chaos Dragon revealed its formidable strength, roaring, "Kill!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger flapped its wings, instantly appearing beside Yue Zhan. Yue Zhan's expression changed. He was incredibly strong, having previously fought the Sun Corona and the Consort of the God Emperor to a draw. But now, a single Chaos Dragon was enough to keep him engaged, not to mention the Eight-Winged Tiger.

Yue Zhan shouted angrily, "You madmen! If Hundred Battle's side could make Yue Luo betray us, their strength must be beyond imagination..."

"Kill!"

Boom!

The battle erupted instantly!

At this moment, Tiangu took a deep breath. No matter what, killing was the right move. These people were all strong human cultivators, and the myriad races were the weakest in this battle. Killing one meant one less!

Tiangu gave a low shout, "Give it your all! All Heavenly Kings and Daofuse cultivators, attack!"

Behind, over a hundred Daofuse cultivators attacked together! The myriad races still had more than ten Heavenly Kings present! Two or three Heavenly Kings could fight a Heavenly Venerable!

The Sun Corona, the Sacred Marquis, and others were incredibly powerful. At this moment, they only had four opponents: two from the demon race and two twins. Yu Qing and Yue Zhan were both entangled. Could they not kill these few?

If they still couldn't, they were truly useless.

"Kill!"

Boom!

The battle erupted just like that!

...

Yu Qing could escape, but when Yue Zhan and the others were entangled, she couldn't leave. At this moment, Yu Qing stopped, and Su Yu's group quickly surrounded her.

Yu Qing's expression was icy!

"Su Yu, your choice is unwise! Even if you kill them, what then? The Gate of Hell has already opened! Strong beings from the Holy Clan will continue to emerge. You're only cutting off your own retreat!"

Su Yu laughed, "Is that so? Actually, I just want to see how strong a true master of laws is! Yu Qing, do you follow the myriad paths or the Chaos Dao?"

Yu Qing frowned, "You'll find out soon enough!"

With that, she thrust her spear!

Chaos!

Su Yu understood. Yu Qing followed the Chaos Dao! This spear seemed to return the world to chaos, powerful and invincible, beyond imagination. It was a difference in level!

With one thrust, the power of chaos swept over. Su Yu slashed with his blade, but it shattered, and the spear remained!

However, the next moment, March and the others attacked together!

Six strong individuals attacked together. The shadow of the Giant Axe was shattered instantly, and March's Giant Bamboo was also pierced!

Marquis Tongtian shifted the spear's power, Fat Ball devoured the power of chaos, and Destiny extended a finger, causing the spear to veer off course. Fat Ball stomped down, finally shattering the spear!

The six of them felt a chill in their hearts!

Too strong!

Here, Su Yu and Fat Ball weren't weak, yet it took all six of them to shatter the spear's shadow!

Su Yu raised an eyebrow slightly, "A master of laws... indeed stronger than I imagined!"

"Die!"

The spear, filled with even stronger killing intent, thrust towards Su Yu. In an instant, Su Yu's aura surged, absorbing myriad paths into his body, his form growing larger. He wielded a large blade and slashed out!

Boom!

This time, Su Yu's blade didn't shatter so easily!

The battle erupted just like that.

Yu Qing didn't actually want to fight. At this moment, while exchanging blows with Su Yu and the others, she quickly transmitted a message, "Retreat! Withdraw! Don't engage in a prolonged battle..."

They wanted to retreat!

But how?

There was no way to retreat!

Too many!

Too many strong individuals, not just twice the number of Heavenly Venerables, but a large number of Heavenly Kings and Daofuse cultivators attacking together. This was when one could truly experience what it meant for ants to bite an elephant to death!

The twins roared, but they were besieged by the Sun Corona, the Sacred Marquis, and two other top-tier beings. Alongside them, two Heavenly Venerables, Ming and Feng, attacked with all their might. Four strong individuals, along with over ten Heavenly Kings, were causing the twins to show signs of collapse!

The twins were utterly desperate!

They hadn't expected that even with Yu Qing's supreme presence, the situation would still be like this!

The next moment, the twins thought of something, roared, and with a shared mind, burned everything, flying madly towards the territory of the Control King. The myriad races' strong individuals quickly pursued.

Su Yu wanted to stop them, but after a glance, he frowned slightly and didn't intervene!

The Control King's lineage still wanted to summon strong individuals!

He could see it!

But if they died, they died. If they emerged, they emerged. Chaos was already present, and more chaos was better.

Just as he thought this, boom!

Two loud explosions echoed through the heavens!

The twins self-destructed the moment they neared the Control King's territory, causing a massive explosion that killed many Heavenly Kings and Daofuse cultivators. A powerful energy swept through the heavens!

Simultaneously, an incredibly strong force erupted, quickly permeating the void and disappearing.

Deep within the Control King's territory, the previously silent Gate of Hell trembled slightly.

Behind the gate, an ancient presence's voice resonated, "I want to go out! Su Yu has killed me twice, and I must kill him!"

"Po Long... aren't you afraid that I might also fall?"

"Hmph!"

The Po Long Beast ignored it. This time, it wanted to go out! To kill Su Yu and those bastards!

Of course, the power wasn't enough yet, but the crack in the Gate of Hell had widened a bit more. If a few more died, it could go out!

...

The twins self-destructed!

In an instant, two Heavenly Venerables perished, but the pursuing myriad races' strong individuals also suffered heavy losses. Many Heavenly Kings and Daofuse cultivators died, and the two Heavenly Venerables, Ming and Feng, were severely injured by the explosion!

Fortunately, the Sun Corona and the Sacred Marquis intervened to block the blast. Otherwise, a Heavenly Venerable might have fallen!

Over there, the two Heavenly Venerables from the demon race were besieged by the Dao Heavenly Venerable, the Origin Saint Marquis, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable, Tiangu, and the Consort of the God Emperor. The Demon Heavenly Venerable sighed, feeling a bit melancholic.

The development of the battle had exceeded their expectations!

The moment Marquis Ziyun arrived, he was killed. Moon Luo and Moon Xiao betrayed them, and Yue Hao was instantly slain... One unexpected event after another led to the untimely demise of many Heavenly Venerables!

If not for these incidents, the Demon Race and the Control King's lineage might not have feared Su Yu and his allies! But now... there was no time for regrets.

Demon Heaven transmitted a message, "Mo, you should leave. Head to Ren Mountain and evacuate everyone..."

"You..."

"My death is better than all of us dying! It's all for the Demon Race! Perhaps we shouldn't have trusted those who haven't returned, including the Demon Emperor! Those who descended from the lower realm are decent. Find them and nurture them well... We... are truly old!"

With a hint of bitterness, Demon Heaven finished his transmission. In the next moment, a violent aura erupted instantly!

The people of Tiangu retreated one after another.

In an instant, an incomparably powerful aura exploded, boom!

Another loud noise echoed through the heavens and earth!

Taking advantage of this moment, Mo Heavenly Venerable tore through the void and fled. Some wanted to pursue, but they immediately stopped. Demon Heaven's self-detonation severely injured Yuan Sheng, leaving him on the brink of death!

Seeing this, Tiangu immediately shouted, "Don't pursue!"

Yuan Sheng had just helped block a large portion of the self-detonation's aftermath; otherwise, Yuan Sheng Marquis wouldn't have been so easily injured!

In the blink of an eye, three Heavenly Venerables had fallen!

Mo Heavenly Venerable fled!

At this moment, Moon Zhan roared, sending a chaotic dragon flying with a punch, and shouted, "Senior Sister, retreat!"

Over there, Yu Qing also swept away March with a spear, forcing Su Yu to retreat. Quickly breaking through, he grabbed Moon Zhan, coldly looked at Su Yu and his group, and swiftly flew towards the Gate of Hell, coldly saying, "If you want to kill us, then come!"

The Gate of Hell trembled once more!

A powerful aura began to rise.

The voice of the Dragon of Chaos echoed, "Su Yu... wait for me to come out!"

He was about to emerge!

Demon Heaven's self-detonation also killed some Daofuse experts, and with most of Demon Heaven's power of laws being drawn away, the fall of three Heavenly Venerables, along with several Heavenly Kings and many Daofuse experts, indicated that someone was about to emerge!

Su Yu raised an eyebrow slightly, looking at Tiangu and the others. At this moment, they had suffered significant losses. Among the Heavenly Venerables, Yuan Sheng, Heavendoom, Phoenix Heavenly Venerable, Moon Heavenly Venerable, and Dragon Heavenly Venerable were all injured, with Moon Heavenly Venerable yet to recover his physical body.

Some Heavenly Kings had also died, and many Daofuse experts had fallen.

Without waiting for Su Yu to speak, Tiangu shouted in a low voice, "Retreat, return to the Myriad Race Mountain, seal the mountain!"

With those words, a group of people quickly retreated!

Su Yu's expression changed slightly, "Tiangu..."

Tiangu did not look back, "From today, the Myriad Races will seal the mountain! If any side wishes to fight, we will accompany them at any time!"

"From today, the Myriad Races will not initiate war. If anyone wishes to fight... they will have to exchange their lives for it!"

In the blink of an eye, over a hundred powerful beings left.

At this moment, Tiangu's aura was strong, and he no longer negotiated with Su Yu.

Having weakened the Control King's lineage and forced Yu Qing and the others back to the Gate of Hell, he would no longer participate in the battle. He wanted to return and establish the Ren Mountain system, to firmly defend Ren Mountain!

These humans were too cunning.

That bastard Su Yu hadn't even agreed to lift the seal, so he wouldn't cooperate with Su Yu anymore.

Taking advantage of the fact that the Heavenly Venerables hadn't fallen yet, they would quickly heal, reorganize, and unite with all sides. This was the Myriad Races' path forward!

Su Yu couldn't help but curse!

Damn it!

Why run so fast?

There was hope to join forces and kill Yu Qing and the others!

What a pity!

Not far away, the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger exchanged glances and quickly fled, flying towards the depths of chaos, running!

Be careful of Su Yu turning hostile!

And Su Yu, his expression changed again and again, also ran.

"Retreat!"

Su Yu shouted in a low voice. If they didn't retreat, Yu Qing and Moon Zhan might turn back, and it would be Su Yu's misfortune.

The Myriad Races and Chaos Ancient Beasts were very cunning.

They all ran, so how could he borrow a knife to kill?

Su Yu sighed. Why do people have to think?

Wouldn't it be better to be my tool?

If you made me happy, maybe I wouldn't deal with you!

Really!
