Chapter 736: Wounding the Enemy a Thousand, Hurting Ourselves Eight Hundred

Does the Torchbearer lineage truly still exist? No one knows for sure. As for the recent attack, it was clearly the work of the Chaos lineage, but... who can guarantee that there isn't a shadow of the Torchbearer lineage involved?

At this moment, Heavenly Venerable Ming and Desolate Heavenly Venerable returned, their auras spilling over, faces cold and grim. They too had seen the words, and Heavenly Venerable Ming scanned the area with a sharp gaze, suppressing his anger as he spoke in a deep voice, "The Chaos Race!"

Heavenly Venerable Mo nodded slightly but spoke softly, "It's just... I'm wondering, was the battle at the Source of the Dao truly orchestrated by the Chaos Race?"

Silence fell over the crowd.

Heavenly Venerable Mo continued, "In the battle at the Source of the Dao, we saw a quasi-king fall, named Ziyan... and there were some rumors circulating before. You all must have heard them, right?"

"Yes, it's said that Ziyan didn't return to the Upper Realm after the last tide."

"If he didn't return to the Upper Realm, how did he end up dying at the Source of the Dao?"

At this moment, the powerful figures of the myriad races wore strange expressions, filled with worry. A single Chaos Race was enough trouble, and now there might be a Torchbearer lineage as well.

From the Immortal Race, Marquis Yuan Sheng suddenly spoke, "The situation in the Lower Realm isn't great either. Marquis Falling Star and Marquis Devil Dance, among others, have fallen in battle. Tiangu and the others haven't sent any news recently. If I didn't know he was still alive, I'd think the Lower Realm had been conquered!"

"Such a favorable situation... how did it come to this?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable also frowned slightly. The situation was favorable; during the Ninth Tide War, they had crushed the Human Race, clearly on the verge of a great victory. Even at the peak of the Human Race, they couldn't turn the tide. Yet now, just as they were about to wipe them out, a series of unexpected events occurred.

Heavenly Venerable Ming gritted his teeth, "The enemy is in the dark while we are in the light. This is our biggest problem! The Ninth Tide was a great victory, but now we are exposed, our forces scattered, no longer as united as we were in the past. When a crisis hits, the myriad races used to unite instantly. Now, despite our strength, we have grown distant, our battlefields spread far apart, making timely aid impossible!"

First the Dragon Race, then the Nether Race. The key issue is that the enemy is hidden, while they are exposed! Whether it's the Torchbearer lineage or the Chaos Race, how many of them do you know? How many powerful figures do they have? You know nothing! They hide in the shadows, while the Human Race on the surface is nearly extinct, yet those in the shadows grow ever more terrifying.

They kill you, and you don't even know who did it!

For a moment, everyone wore grim expressions.

After the great victory of the myriad races, they were no longer as cautious as before. Many battlefields were opened, and the Daofuse Realm cultivators were scattered. Yet six thousand years ago, the Daofuse Realm of the God, Demon, and Immortal Races were almost inseparable, and the battlefields of other races were nearly united.

After a great victory, the races scrambled for territory, their numbers swelling. Originally, the Upper Realm had only a few Daofuse Realm and Eternal cultivators, but now, the God, Demon, and Immortal Races alone had nearly ten million residents in the Upper Realm!

Now, looking at the devastated Nether Race, the crowd's expressions were uncertain.

Among the crowd, some small race powerhouses were also feeling insecure.

The Dragon and Nether Races are both great races, yet they ended up like this. What about them? If a few more powerful figures emerge from the other side, won't their races be wiped out?

Heavenly Venerable Mo glanced at Dao Heavenly Venerable, who then looked at Moon Heavenly Venerable. The Heavenly Venerables exchanged glances. Heavenly Venerable Mo's purple hair fluttered as he spoke coldly, "The enemy is in the dark while we are in the light. This is our biggest disadvantage now. Our forces are scattered, and if a crisis arises, aid cannot arrive in time!"

He paused for a moment, then continued, "I have discussed this with several Heavenly Venerables before. Ren Mountain is extremely formidable and a cultivation treasure land, though it is affected by some power of laws. However, over the years, it has nearly dissipated! Ren Mountain is vast beyond measure. We intend to re-establish the Myriad Race Alliance! Migrate to Ren Mountain, confront Chaos Mountain! The myriad races will migrate from the Upper Realm, abandon their battlefields, and take root in Ren Mountain!"

As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd's expressions changed.

Some of the great races were reluctant, while some small race powerhouses gritted their teeth. Soon, a small race powerhouse loudly declared, "Our race is willing to migrate and seek shelter in Ren Mountain!"

Willing to migrate!

The myriad races would completely form an alliance.

The events with the Nether and Dragon Races only strengthened the resolve of the myriad race powerhouses to unify.

If it weren't for the Nether Race incident, many might not have agreed.

Am I not satisfied being my own overlord?

Why should I live under someone else's roof?

Back then, the Luminous Domain Mansion was like this. The powerhouses of the myriad races gathered there, and no one was willing. But now, Chaos Mountain easily crushed the Nether Race, leaving everyone worried.

And Su Yu, his heart trembled slightly.

Soon, he couldn't help but curse inwardly.

Damn you!

Those bastards from Chaos Mountain, now things are troublesome.

The myriad races want to gather together!

Before, they could launch a surprise attack or something. Once the myriad races gather in Ren Mountain, if you attack one, two more will come immediately. In this way, sneak attacks and blitzkrieg tactics will be difficult to employ.

You must always be wary of being surrounded!

Can they succeed?

If the Nether Race isn't destroyed, it might not succeed. There will surely be opposition from some races.

But now, with the powerful Nether Race ending up like this, aren't the small races afraid of being wiped out?

Sure enough, soon, some small races began to speak up, "Heavenly Venerables, the urgent task is to deal with the Human Race. Migrating Ren Mountain to Chaos Mountain is feasible!"

"Whether it's the Chaos Race or the Torchbearer lineage, if they are one, there's nothing to say. If they are not one, their strength must be inferior to ours. Otherwise, they wouldn't keep launching sneak attacks without engaging in direct battles!"

"With the united strength of the myriad races, the Human Race will surely be no match!"

"If the two are not one, there might be enmity... after all, the Chaos Race schemed against the Hundred Battle King... as we consolidate our positions, they might start fighting each other!"

"......"

Moon Nether's plan was successful!

You don't need to believe that the Torchbearer lineage did this, but now, the myriad races must assume that this lineage truly exists.

Su Yu said he wasn't part of the Torchbearer lineage, but the enemy now knows there's such a force. If it doesn't work, maybe throw out the Great Zhou King?

"Wounding the enemy a thousand, hurting ourselves eight hundred!"

Su Yu cursed inwardly. The Control King's lineage, doing this, is thankless.

Su Yu's side was naturally affected, but if the myriad races unite, and the Chaos Mountain lineage wants to fight next, it will be a tough battle. Does it benefit you?

"Damn it!"

Su Yu grumbled for a while, then sighed. The Human Race... is still the Human Race.

Yes, if it were him, he might do the same.

Who cares!

I know that some of my secrets will be exposed this way, but if my secrets are exposed, I'll make sure to trouble you as well.

Aren't you trying to hide?

I'll force you out!

When the myriad races fight Chaos Mountain, they will surely guard against the Torchbearer lineage. This is beyond doubt.

The key isn't just this. At this moment, Heavenly Venerable Mo spoke in a deep voice, "The Upper Realm is vast, with many powerful figures scattered across various places, making it difficult to clear them out! However, if the myriad races gather in Ren Mountain, Ren Mountain is vast enough to accommodate billions of beings!"

"Gather the myriad races, announce to the Upper Realm that anyone who doesn't come to gather in Ren Mountain will be considered part of the Human Race, considered beings outside the myriad races! When fighting Chaos Mountain, as you saw today, there are many quasi-kings, and this might not even be Chaos Mountain's full strength!"

"With the united strength of the myriad races, we can resist. The Daofuse Realm will gather in Ren Mountain, while the Heavenly Venerable level will follow me to sweep the Upper Realm, inch by inch, sweeping through, and any beings not entering Ren Mountain can be killed! Clear the Source of the Dao, clear all major danger zones. Over the years, we couldn't do this because we couldn't focus... we couldn't do it!"

"But now, with strong enemies outside, we must unite as one, sweep the Upper Realm, root out all enemies, and kill them all!"

"On Ren Mountain, establish the Myriad Race Surveillance Department to prevent internal and external collusion, rename Ren Mountain to Myriad Race Mountain... check the channels between the Lower and Upper Realms, establish the Ten Thousand Laws Tower to monitor the fluctuations of all laws. If there are anomalies, the Surveillance Department will act to eliminate them!"

"First destroy Chaos Mountain, then the Human Race, and then discuss the affairs of the myriad races!"

"Only by uniting can we resist the Human Race! The Human Race, the darlings of heaven, are eternal. If the Human Race is not destroyed... the myriad races will eventually perish!"

"......"

The Heavenly Venerables spoke one after another.

Clearly, this decision wasn't made today. It might have been decided long ago, but there wasn't an appropriate time. Now, however, it was brought up.

As these words were spoken, Su Yu felt a heavy weight.

What boldness!

Gather the myriad races in Ren Mountain, and the Heavenly Venerables will sweep the entire Upper Realm, flatten all major danger zones, quell all chaos in the rear. If there are any disturbances, don't care who it is, they must be enemies, and they should be killed!

In this way, perhaps... something big will happen!

Where will my people hide?

The Upper Realm is vast, but also small in a sense.

There are many danger zones, but they can't stop top-tier powerhouses. Once they are flattened... and there's the Soul Burying Mountain passage, once the Heavenly Venerables sweep through all danger zones, something might happen!

As for the so-called Ten Thousand Laws Tower, in Su Yu's understanding, it might be similar to the sensing mirror of the Great Ming Prefecture, capable of detecting all energy fluctuations.

At this moment, Su Yu felt like cursing!

Damn Chaos Mountain!

Why did you have to wipe out the Nether Race for no reason!

The Heavenly Venerables of several races seized the opportunity to resolve some previous issues, and now no one would oppose it. Who opposes... who has a problem!

Sure enough, following the words of the Heavenly Venerables, March, Marquis Destiny, and Thunderstorm exchanged glances, all frowning slightly, but they were helpless!

Refuse?

It's so dangerous, the Chaos Race might attack and wipe out a race at any time, and you don't want to band together for safety. Why not?

Do you have collusion with the other side?

Just as everyone was thinking, Desolate Heavenly Venerable spoke indifferently, "What do you all think? This move will protect everyone from the harassment of Chaos Mountain or the Torchbearer lineage! Including the Source of the Dao, although it has many benefits, it is not safe now! If any race still has people hiding in the Source of the Dao for cultivation, please recall them all, return to Myriad Race Mountain! This time, if we sweep through, the Source of the Dao will also be swept once!"

In the depths of the Dao Source Land, the myriad races had long maintained a delicate balance, each governing their own territories without interference. Yet, who could truly know how many ancient powers lay hidden within? Even among the Human Race, there might be ancient beings concealed within these lands.

The Desolate Heavenly Sovereign spoke coldly, "To prevent Human Race experts from infiltrating, every race's Eternal and Daofuse cultivators should leave a wisp of willpower to create a Soul Token. Passage through Ren Mountain requires a Soul Token for everyone's safety. Without it, entry and exit are forbidden!"

This declaration caused quite a stir among the gathered races. March wanted to speak but held back, noticing that Thunderstorm seemed inclined to voice his thoughts.

Indeed, Thunderstorm spoke up, his voice deep, "A Soul Token? Denying entry without one is akin to imprisonment!"

"These are special times!" the Desolate Heavenly Sovereign retorted icily. "Once Chaos Mountain is dealt with, everything will return to normal. Thunderstorm, your Ancient Giant Race hasn't suffered much, or perhaps not at all, so of course, you don't care. But other races have suffered losses. Why hasn't the Ancient Giant Race? Ask the myriad races: is safety more important, or is freedom? Besides, the Myriad Races Mountain is vast and a sacred land for cultivation. As long as we suppress the lingering influence of the ancient Human Race's Great Dao, nothing will be hindered!"

Su Yu silently prayed, hoping Thunderstorm wouldn't lose his temper. Thunderstorm's expression shifted, and around them, several Heavenly Sovereigns remained silent, their auras restrained, as if the calm before a storm.

Eventually, Thunderstorm suppressed his anger and said, "Fine, I can agree, but... the Ancient Giant Race must join the decision-making level of the Myriad Races Council!"

Previously reluctant to be used as a pawn, now they had to vie for power. Who knew how the three major races might scheme against them otherwise?

The Heavenly Sovereign Mo chuckled softly, "That's not a problem. Not just your race..."

He glanced around, smiling lightly, "Any race with a Heavenly Sovereign willing to come forth and assist can join this decision-making council!"

They aimed to lure out the hidden experts of other races. If they remained hidden, fine. But if they didn't come out, the decision-making would be left to them, and the fate of other races would be left to chance.

The Heavenly Sovereign Mo and his companions focused on some of the major races. Did the Dragon Race still have a Heavenly Sovereign? What about the Phoenix Race? And the Spirit Race? Kunpeng, Golden-winged Roc, Three-headed Demon Wolf, Hellhound, Golden Crow... Did these ancient races have no trump cards at all? Were they waiting for the three major races to suffer heavy losses before emerging?

Within the myriad races, there was no single race, and internal conflicts and schemes were rampant. The three major races had long wanted to uncover the trump cards of each race, and now they were using this as an opportunity to do so.

The powerful figures of the major races exchanged glances, each Daofuse cultivator communicating silently, deep in thought.

Meanwhile, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign and his companions remained indifferent. The Nether Heavenly Sovereign's expression was grim, clearly aware of their intentions to consolidate power by first uniting the strength of the myriad races. Those with weaker voices would be thrown out as cannon fodder.

The Nether Heavenly Sovereign remained silent, focusing on gathering the strength of the Nether Race. This time, the Nether Race had suffered significant losses, and he was pained by it. Two quasi-kings of his race had been killed, making him feel like vomiting blood.

Thinking of this, he suddenly spoke, "The Chaos Race... should have the ability to probe the secrets of heaven! Some sensed it last time, and it's the same this time. Ming Le and the others weren't in their own race but were hiding in the Shadow Race, yet they were discovered and killed first... Clearly, the other side can locate our experts. Additionally, they are skilled in formations, possibly using the Deceiving Heaven Formation of the Control King from back then!"

"Are those two groups the same?" Thunderstorm couldn't help but ask. Both seemed to have similar skills, observing heavenly secrets and using the Deceiving Heaven Formation. How did they end up looking like the same group again?

"Perhaps the Chaos Race is deliberately creating confusion to make us overthink. Anything is possible; just be prepared for both possibilities!" the Moon Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, offering an explanation. Whether they were the same or not, it was best to treat them as two separate groups for now.

At this moment, within the various races, a Daofuse expert suddenly spoke, "Reporting to the Heavenly Sovereigns, speaking of the Chaos Race, I recall a minor matter. According to our intelligence, recently, some experts near our race encountered individuals who might be remnants of the Human Race... Their strength wasn't great; some encountered Sunmoon Realm, others Eternal... Could this be related to the Chaos Race?"

"Your race encountered them too? It seems my race also had someone mention it..." another voice chimed in.

The expressions of the Heavenly Sovereign Mo and his companions changed slightly. Quickly, the Heavenly Sovereign Mo angrily demanded, "Why wasn't this reported sooner?"

The Daofuse experts were embarrassed and speechless. It was just a minor matter, after all. A few Sunmoon or Eternal Realm individuals—did they really need to report such trivialities? They weren't subordinates of the Heavenly Sovereigns!

The Heavenly Sovereign Mo's expression turned cold, and he quickly said, "The matter of gathering the myriad races at Myriad Races Mountain must be put on the agenda immediately! The Demon Heavenly Sovereign, Dao Heavenly Sovereign, and Nether Heavenly Sovereign will seal off the perimeter of Chaos Mountain. We will move Myriad Races Mountain here, and once the relocation is complete, we will, along with ten quasi-kings, clear the dangerous areas of the Upper Realm one by one! Six thousand years ago, I proposed clearing those dangerous areas, but everyone disagreed, giving the Human Race an opportunity. Marquis Dingjun and others have yet to be eradicated, and now... so many experts have died. I think it's time for everyone to wake up!"

Back then, they thought the Human Race was no longer a threat, and the greatest danger was each other. Now? Are they still not a threat?

...

At this moment, March was anxious, transmitting to Su Yu, "What do we do now? They're moving Ren Mountain here, the three Heavenly Sovereigns are sealing off Chaos Mountain, and others are starting to sweep from the Dao Source Land... This... this is a big problem!"

It's like taking the pot from under the fire! For so many years, the myriad races hadn't unified, but now, they might actually achieve unity.

March was at a loss!

Su Yu was also serious. Those small races were likely referring to Xia Longwu and some of the guardians. And with the relocation of races, what about the Iron Devourer Race here? April and the others were here, along with Wan Tiansheng and others. It would be difficult to hide from a sweep by multiple Heavenly Sovereigns.

Sweeping from east to west might take a lot of time, but... sweeping bit by bit would be truly difficult to handle. If they went down from Soul Burying Mountain, that path might be discovered. If discovered, and these people could forcefully descend to the lower realm... that would be an even greater crisis.

At this moment, Su Yu cursed the bastards of Chaos Mountain a thousand times over!

Damn it!

My plan hasn't even started, and it feels like danger is coming my way, while those bastards of Chaos Mountain can sit back and watch the show!

The myriad races are determined to do this, so what now? Opposing it is impossible. If they oppose, these guys might target the Iron Devourer Race first!

Plans flashed through Su Yu's mind one after another, only to be quickly discarded.

They wouldn't work!

At this moment, the Destiny Marquis sighed softly, "We have established our foothold in the Upper Realm for many years, and our Dao Fields have been set up for many years. Are we to abandon everything and establish ourselves anew at Myriad Races Mountain? If so... the Fate Clan's Dao Field requires our personal arrangement... We are not like the God, Demon, and Immortal Races, with many experts. We need to return to make arrangements before we can relocate. Even if we abandon the Dao Field, we must seal it to prevent years of effort from being destroyed!"

The Heavenly Sovereign Mo chuckled, "Why not let me arrange for someone to help you clear it? The Origin Saint Marquis and others are more than capable... Blood Severance and those guys can do it too! If Destiny Dao Brother doesn't trust them..."

The Destiny Marquis frowned slightly, "What is Mo Dao Friend trying to do?"

The Heavenly Sovereign Mo replied indifferently, "Nothing, just... everyone is scattered now, and I'm worried about danger! March, Thunderstorm, and other Dao Brothers are the same. My thought is that we, starting from the Dao Source Land, begin clearing and sweeping. Isn't April there? Arrange for someone to return, make some arrangements, and seal the place. Why rush? Are you afraid of other races occupying the Dao Field?"

March chuckled foolishly, "Dao Friend is worried we'll run away if we go back? How could that be? The Upper Realm is only so big, and with the lower realm's passage unopened, where could we go?"

The Heavenly Sovereign Mo laughed, "Dao Friend misunderstands. It's just that at this moment, the crisis is imminent, and time is of the essence! I'll accompany Dao Friend March, the Dao Heavenly Sovereign will accompany Dao Friend Destiny, and the Moon Heavenly Sovereign will accompany Dao Friend Thunderstorm. Pairing up, we can look out for each other!"

Six Heavenly Sovereigns, three to seal this place. The other three would first move Ren Mountain, then pair up to begin clearing the Upper Realm.

With two Heavenly Sovereigns working together, even if Hundred Battle were unsealed, killing them would likely be a fierce battle, and others could provide timely assistance. Moreover, it would prevent these three from causing any trouble.

Once their people arrived and were settled at Ren Mountain, with Ren Mountain sealed, unless they abandoned their people and defected alone, everything would be under control!

March and the others exchanged helpless glances.

The Destiny Marquis smiled wryly, "Is it really necessary?"

"Better safe than sorry!"

Destiny sighed, "Fine, fine, let it be so! The myriad races are not united... how can they succeed..."

"This gathering at Myriad Races Mountain will naturally unite hearts!" the Heavenly Sovereign Mo laughed. "Back then, during the ancient Human Race's dominance, weren't the myriad races united? The Myriad Races Council delayed the Human Race's unification of the heavens. If not for the council's existence, would we be here today? Though the council has disappeared, the ancient Human Race's hegemony has also declined! People say the Human Race has deep foundations, but don't the myriad races as well? Our ancestors, in a way, also cleared obstacles for us, at least sparing us from facing the Human Emperor and Culture King, those overlords!"

From the perspective of the myriad races, the disappearance of the ancients left many things behind for the Human Race, but didn't the myriad races also benefit? If those ancestors hadn't dealt with the Human Emperor and others, their current enemies would be those monsters! How could they match those beings?

Today's Human Race, no matter how monstrous, hasn't reached the level of being completely unbeatable as in that era.

March was too weary to speak further, cursing silently in his heart. He quickly turned to Su Yu and Lantian, saying in a deep voice, "April, you and Full Moon should return first! Relocate the Bamboo Mountain tribe and seal Bamboo Mountain. At the very least, prevent wandering experts from entering and disrupting the Bamboo Mountain Dojo..."

Over there, Heavenly Venerable Mo said indifferently, "All are experts. Within ten days, all races must gather at the Myriad Race Mountain!"

"Ten days?" someone couldn't help but question, "Isn't that too rushed? After all, some races still have weaker members..."

Heavenly Venerable Mo replied coldly, "Even the weak can fly! If not, store them in weapon spaces. No race is so poor that they lack even a Heavenly Soldier. If they do, they deserve extinction! As for belongings, abandon them. Are you planning to dig up the floorboards too?"

"From the extreme east, even a Sunmoon Realm expert can arrive in less than five days! Giving you ten days is more than enough! Or do you think the Chaos Mountain lineage won't act again?"

Will they act?

They won't... but they might!

Even if Chaos Mountain doesn't act, won't the three major races impersonate them?

When you're given ten days, you must arrive in ten days!

The Iron Devourer Race, the Fate Clan, and the Ancient Giant Race have been intimidated. Can't they intimidate these smaller races too?

Everyone looked at each other, filled with helplessness.

Heavenly Venerable Mo continued, "Each race must leave at least one Daofuse expert here. If there's only one Daofuse, they must not leave. Arrange for an Eternal to handle it!"

As for the Iron Devourer Race, it didn't matter; March was here.

The major experts were all discussing fervently.

They had come to deal with Chaos Mountain, but somehow, it had turned into a migration!

The three major races had seized this opportunity to easily complete the most crucial step towards unification!

Gathering the tribes and people was the foundation of unification.

At this moment, as long as the three major races could reach an agreement and avoid conflict, no one could overthrow them, at least not in the short term!

...

March had to leave with Heavenly Venerable Mo. At this moment, he called Su Yu and Lantian aside, transmitting his voice, "This situation is a mess. I initially thought, at worst, I'd be a vanguard. Who knew... the three major races would take advantage of the Nether Clan's incident to consolidate the other races!"

This was worse than expected!

March was quite frustrated and quickly said, "Be careful when you return! As for the rest... I won't say much. May and the others will follow your orders."

He didn't say how to arrange things.

However, if this went poorly, the people Su Yu brought might be exposed.

"The Bamboo Mountain Dojo, even if the people leave, I'm worried someone will come to plunder or secretly investigate... So, it's best not to leave anyone there!"

March sighed.

What a mess!

He couldn't help but curse, "The Control King's lineage is truly harmful!"

Damn it!

Why attack the Nether Clan out of nowhere?

Su Yu took a deep breath and transmitted with a smile, "It's also a good thing. At least this time, ninety-nine percent of the hidden forces of the myriad races will be exposed! Including the number of experts in the Dao Source Land! Know yourself and your enemy, and you'll never be defeated! Previously, the myriad races' experts emerged endlessly, and no one knew exactly how many there were... This time, it's a crisis, but also an opportunity!"

Thoroughly understanding the number of upper realm experts!

Even the Dao Source Land will be swept clean, and those hidden old fellows will probably be helpless, forced to come out!

Even some who are in deep slumber might be swept out!

March thought for a moment and agreed, but still worriedly said, "I'm concerned that if there are hidden human experts in the Dao Source Land, once they're swept out... the situation might become inescapable!"

Where to escape?

There's no way to escape!

With six Heavenly Venerables sweeping and three Heavenly Venerables sealing the west, sweeping bit by bit, they'll eventually flush people out!

Su Yu didn't speak. It was indeed dangerous, so they had to rely on their luck!

March added, "Moreover, with our people migrating here, we'll still be somewhat restricted unless we completely abandon the tribe!"

But experts don't exist in isolation.

Abandoning the tribe is easier said than done?

No matter how strong an expert is, they are born from the tribe.

Don't look down on these people now; March and others also emerged from them. Without fresh blood, they will eventually perish, as will any strong race!

The Human Emperor and others took away so many experts, wasn't it also for the tribe?

Su Yu nodded, "I'll think of a way. If it really doesn't work... we'll carry them in weapon spaces. The Iron Devourer Race isn't large in number, so they're easy to carry!"

For now, that's the only consideration!

...

Soon, Su Yu and Lantian left the area.

As they were flying, a strong expert quickly pursued them, calling out, "April, my friend!"

Su Yu turned to look, roughly knowing the person's name, and smiled, "Friend Tian Ce!"

A strong expert from the Fate Clan!

Following behind Marquis Destiny, also very powerful. Su Yu had sensed it before, perhaps possessing Heavenly King combat power, but the person's aura was hazy, unclear without opening the Heaven Gate.

Su Yu was puzzled, why call me?

Tian Ce quickly flew over, looked at April, and smiled, "Don't misunderstand, friend April. Previously, Lord Destiny instructed that during this alliance, our two races should look out for each other."

After saying a few words, Tian Ce smiled, "Before I left, Lord Destiny asked me to convey a few words to friend April."

"Please speak."

Su Yu remained expressionless, what words?

Tian Ce quickly said, "In recent days, Lord Destiny observed the celestial phenomena and sensed that the Iron Devourer Race's fortune is flourishing, far surpassing the past! Not only that, but even our own race's fortune is rising, including the Space Ancient Beasts, and even the Hou Race has seen an increase... Lord Destiny finds this unusual. These races have no connection, so why such anomalies? Only the Iron Devourer Race's fortune has increased the most... I wonder if friend April can shed some light?"

Su Yu's heart stirred.

The Fate Clan can really see so clearly?

Fortune increase... well, maybe they can sense something. After all, Wuming seemed to have seen something before.

Let alone the more powerful Marquis Destiny!

The other party might have truly seen something from the path of fortune.

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "Why ask me? You might as well ask my father. How would I know these things?"

Tian Ce laughed, "Lord Destiny said that when he tried to deduce friend April's fortune, the backlash was intense. Perhaps it's related to these matters, so he wanted to ask for your opinion."

Deduce me?

I didn't feel anything, nonsense.

Of course, Marquis Destiny might have really seen something. Thinking of this, Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "This... I really don't know! You know, our race has been allied with the Human Race for many years, and our fortune has risen. Could it be related to Hundred Battle's unsealing?"

Su Yu sighed, "Unfortunately, Hundred Battle's unsealing has also made the other races very wary of us."

Tian Ce pondered, then chuckled, "You mean it's related to the Human Race?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Hard to say."

"I understand."

Tian Ce sighed, nodding, "Alright, I know how to report to Lord Destiny!"

With that, seeing Su Yu about to leave, he hesitated but still said, "Lord Destiny also asked me to convey one more thing."

"Please speak."

Tian Ce transmitted, "Previously, the Dao Source Land incident led all races to speculate whether there is a lower realm passage directly connecting to the upper realm! There are also some rumors from the Chaos Mountain lineage, saying that the Torchbearer holds a passage... Perhaps someone from the lower realm has come up! This time, with the three major races acting like this, those who came up will find it hard to hide. At that time, only Chaos Mountain can provide refuge. The outer area of Chaos Mountain isn't large, but the inner area is vast. Only by fleeing into Chaos Mountain can one avoid detection."

Su Yu listened silently, what are you trying to say?

With three Heavenly Venerables sealing, how to escape to the inner area?

Su Yu had already thought about it. If it doesn't work, let them descend first.

If the Soul Burying Mountain passage is difficult, I'll directly take people through the Dao Source Land to retreat first.

Thinking it's so easy to encircle us... three Heavenly Venerables aren't enough, even more won't do.

If it still doesn't work, then disconnect the Great Dao and hide in the Mark of Civilization. It should also be possible to hide, but carrying so many experts might reveal something through special techniques.

Tian Ce continued transmitting, "Lord Destiny said, if there's no way out, you can try going to the Space Ancient Beast Race's territory. The old ghost of the Space Ancient Beast Race left a way out for himself years ago. The Space Ancient Beasts were once a branch of the ancient beasts! This race has been managing the dojo for many years, and there might be multiple teleportation passages in the tribe, leading to various dangerous places in the upper realm at any time! Even to the inner area of Chaos Mountain, after all, being part of the ancient beasts, if they sever their Great Dao, Chaos Mountain won't reject them!"

Su Yu's heart stirred.

There might really be such a possibility!

Space Ancient Beasts!

This race is most adept at spatial techniques, and it's not impossible for them to leave a way out, creating teleportation sites throughout the upper realm!

And Chaos Mountain is dangerous, known as the number one dangerous place. The more dangerous, the safer it is.

So if there's really a spatial teleportation array connecting to Chaos Mountain, it's possible.

Marquis Destiny knows quite a lot.

Unless absolutely necessary, Su Yu didn't want to go down.

At this moment, he began to weigh the situation.

Maybe... it's a trap!

Anyway, be careful!

Marquis Destiny's words can't be fully trusted, nor can they be completely ignored.

This old guy, observing fortune, might have sensed danger and is now betting on all sides.

"Thank you for the advice!"

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, said no more, and quickly left with Lantian.

Meanwhile, Tian Ce watched them leave and quickly flew towards the Fate Clan's dojo.

This time, whether it's a blessing or a curse, he wasn't sure.

He could also observe the heavenly secrets, but not as clearly as Marquis Destiny. At this time, even Marquis Destiny couldn't see the future clearly.

"Someone from the lower realm must have come up!"

"The power of Dao Rhyme from Wuming has manifested!"

He murmured to himself, Su Yu still hadn't figured it out. Last time, when he brought the river to the upper realm, the river indeed didn't report anything to the Fate Clan, but it carried the Fate Clan's token, which contained a trace of the Fate Emperor's Dao Rhyme power.

Marquis Destiny, being so powerful, still sensed some clues!

Someone from the lower realm must have come up!

Chapter 754: The Plan

In the depths of Bamboo Mountain, Su Yu had just returned. The Great Zhou King and the others quickly gathered, their expressions heavy with concern. Lantian's avatar had already informed them of the latest developments.

"Moving the races to Ren Mountain... and now they're all gone!" Firecloud Marquis exclaimed anxiously. "Why not take this chance to strike hard at the rear, then descend to the lower realm and hold our ground there? March's strength is formidable; shaking off Mo Tianzun shouldn't be a problem. We can lead the Iron Devourer Race to escape the Upper Realm!"

It was a suggestion worth considering. However, Wan Tiansheng and the others knew that Su Yu was unlikely to give up so easily.

The Great Zhou King quickly interjected, "I can visit the passage at Soul Burying Mountain to obscure it temporarily. At least for a short while, it won't be exposed."

Su Yu turned his gaze towards him.

The Great Zhou King, feeling awkward, explained, "I'm merely concealing it a bit, not hiding anything else. This passage was originally opened by a Human Realm expert..."

Su Yu's cold stare lingered on him for a moment before he finally said, "If you can conceal it, do so. This passage must not be exposed!"

"Understood!" The Great Zhou King replied, feeling somewhat helpless. Why the cold shoulder? I haven't hidden anything. It was always possible to conceal it. Did I need to report every little thing to you?

Meanwhile, Fat Ball yawned lazily, seemingly indifferent. "That Destiny Marquis mentioned checking out the Space Ancient Beast Race. Actually, it's possible... I've eaten Chaos Mountain ancient beasts before! I can sniff around from here, and with Doubao's help, maybe we can determine if it really leads to the inner regions of Chaos Mountain."

Doubao nodded in agreement. "We can hide over there first... As for the teleportation fluctuations... bringing the Starry Sky Seal might suppress them. That way, even if we teleport over, no one will know."

Wan Tiansheng added, "If we're unwilling to descend just yet, hiding there might be our best and most suitable opportunity!"

The Great Ming King chimed in, "I can set up an array similar to the one at Dao Origin Mountain to conceal the Great Dao fluctuations. But right now, I lack the materials to create personal concealment talismans... I need some ancient beast corpses!"

Su Yu frowned. Ancient beast corpses were hard to come by.

Just as he was pondering, the Great Qin King silently snapped off his arm and tossed it to the Great Ming King.

"..."

Everyone stared at him in shock.

The Great Qin King said in a deep voice, "What are you looking at? Make the talismans. We're considered Desolate Beasts now, part of the ancient beasts! Old Xia, break off an arm for Old Zhu to study..."

Everyone's mouths hung open. The Great Xia King, looking resigned, snapped off an arm with a crack.

"Old Zhu, if it's not enough, just say so!"

The Great Qin King was generous. Enough? If not, we'll break off a few more arms and legs for you!

"..."

Su Yu was speechless. This... might actually work! Desolate Beasts were indeed part of the ancient beasts, and these two were now small-scale Daofuse Realm Desolate Beasts!

The Great Ming King, after a brief examination, was delighted. "No problem! With your four arms and four legs, I can craft eight talismans. However... I'll need to set up a large concealment array first. Only then can the remaining seven be used to create seven talismans for individual use! As for any limbs grown later, the ancient aura might be too weak unless cultivated for a while..."

He quickly added, "Why don't you two remove all your ribs and extract your spinal bones? Maybe we can make more..."

The Great Qin King's mouth twitched.

Damn you! I was just being polite, and you're really setting conditions. Might as well give you our entire bodies!

Are you even human?

The Great Xia King couldn't hold back either, angrily saying, "Why don't we just give you our entire bodies? That way, you can leave a pile of flesh to blow up the enemy!"

What are you thinking!

Su Yu rubbed his forehead, glancing at the Great Ming King. To be honest, he had also considered dismantling these two, but then thought better of it. It was too inhumane.

Clearing his throat, Su Yu quickly said, "Seven talismans should suffice for now! One for each Heavenly King: Firecloud, Giant Bamboo, Director Wan, Lantian, myself, Fat Ball, and the Great Zhou King. As for the others... when the great battle erupts, ancient beasts will inevitably suffer losses. We'll figure it out then!"

"Alright then!" The Great Ming King reluctantly agreed, casting a longing glance at the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, wishing he could dismantle them to see if he could make more.

The Great Qin King felt exhausted. When one's strength is insufficient, one can only rely on bones. It's truly pitiful!
