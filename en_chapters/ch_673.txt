Chapter 673: Replacing the Guardians (Ten Thousand Words, Please Subscribe)

Human Realm, autumn had arrived.

The autumn wind was chilly.

This might be the last calm before the great war. The entire Human Realm knew that the Myriad Realms were on the brink of war. Although the great war hadn't started, millions of soldiers were continuously attacking smaller realms. In the Eastern War Zone, any small realm that refused to surrender was annihilated!

Xia Longwu and several generals led their armies like a swarm of locusts!

Those who did not surrender faced extermination!

Even those who surrendered had to offer vast amounts of resources!

Xia Longwu and his forces were using countless resources and the Myriad Realms to sustain the Human Race.

This was war!

There was no right or wrong. The smaller races saw the Human Race as villains, while the Human Race felt pressured by the myriad races. The immortals and demons thought the Human Race was overly ambitious. It was a vicious cycle!

Su Yu didn't concern himself with these matters.

These were wars beneath the Eternal level. It was said that in the military, within just two months, dozens of Sunmoon Realm experts and nearly a thousand Mountainsea Realm experts had emerged, all forcibly elevated through countless resources and the rewards of heaven and earth.

Such a war across the Myriad Realms hadn't been seen in over four hundred years, and it wasn't as intense as it was now.

...

This time, Su Yu waited in the Human Realm for ten days.

The Heaven Casting King, urged by Su Yu's constant military orders, was on the brink of collapse. He relentlessly exploited all the casting masters to forge weapons with him, to the point where they were sick of it. Finally, within Su Yu's deadline, they prioritized crafting weapons for those about to assume the role of guardians.

In total, it took nearly three months.

...

In the Sacred Hall.

When Su Yu saw the Heaven Casting King again, the latter looked as if he hadn't slept in centuries. His face was pale, his eyes were cloudy, and he seemed ready to collapse at any moment.

To push an Eternal expert to such a state showed how much this once weapon-loving expert regretted being a casting master.

"Heaven Casting King, your weapon crafting is quite impressive..."

"Ugh..."

The Heaven Casting King suddenly retched and quickly said, "Emperor Yu, please don't mention it... I never want to craft weapons again! Just hearing those two words makes me want to vomit. I never want to do it again in my life!"

In three months, he had crafted over thirty Heaven-tier weapons!

He felt like vomiting and dying.

On average, one weapon every three days. Fortunately, Zhao Li advanced to a Heaven-tier casting master, and Zhao Tianbing as well. Both were close to advancing before, and during this crafting period, they succeeded. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to complete the task.

Su Yu chuckled, "You say that, but the Human Race can do without many things, yet it cannot do without weapon crafting. I believe the Heaven Casting King is just speaking casually. By the way, the Heaven-tier weapons for the guardians are done, and the Eternals in the Human Realm are waiting! They're waiting to step into the Weapon Fusion Method with new weapons. Heaven Casting King, you can't just drop everything..."

The Heaven Casting King's face turned ashen.

No, I don't want to!

I don't want to craft weapons anymore!

Yes, in these three months, he worked overtime to finish the guardians' weapons, but many strong individuals in the Human Realm still hadn't received their main weapons for the Weapon Fusion Method.

Even if they had weapons, transforming them into the main weapon for the Weapon Fusion Method required modifications!

Thinking of this, the Heaven Casting King wanted to die!

And Su Yu continued with a smile, "Not only that, but I see that with the ongoing battles, it's the easiest time to prove one's Dao. Moreover, there are some relics in the Human Realm, very suitable for proving one's Dao, close to the rules... If these people succeed in proving their Dao, Heaven Casting King, you'll need to prepare their weapons in advance!"

Crying!

The Heaven Casting King was on the verge of collapse, "Emperor Yu, I really can't do it anymore!"

"You can!"

Su Yu smiled, "Hang in there. With so much weapon crafting, your understanding of the Great Dao deepens. Trust me, in a while, I'll take you on a journey through the Weapon Casting Dao. You might instantly step into the high stage of the Eternal level, or even stronger! You might be the fastest to advance to the Daofuse level in the Human Realm. I have high hopes for you!"

"Daofuse?"

The Heaven Casting King was stunned. Could he really reach Daofuse?

Su Yu nodded, "To put it bluntly, it's only now that the Human Realm lacks Heaven-tier casting masters. Otherwise, in any other era, how could a Heaven-tier casting master craft so many Heaven-tier weapons that they feel like vomiting? You have all the materials you need, and even if you fail, you don't have to compensate. In other times, with more Heaven-tier casting masters, who would give you this opportunity to craft weapons every day?"

Su Yu laughed, "In these three months, the Heaven Casting King has crafted the amount a Heaven-tier casting master would in ten thousand years! Crafting one Heaven-tier weapon every thirty years is normal. Thirty weapons, isn't that ten thousand years' worth?"

The Heaven Casting King thought for a moment and nodded. That's true.

Because there were too few Heaven-tier casting masters in the Human Race, otherwise, he wouldn't have had this chance to craft weapons every day until he felt like vomiting.

Su Yu continued, "Last time, I took you on a journey through the Weapon Casting Dao, but the Heaven Casting King hadn't decided which path to take. Do you have any results or thoughts now? In the Weapon Casting Dao, the Heaven Casting King has the best hope of reaching Daofuse! The Great Ming King wants to reach Daofuse through the Array Dao, and the Time King through the Speed Dao..."

"Honestly, I really like experts like you who have unique understandings!"

Su Yu praised, "Unlike the Path of the Warrior, which is straightforward and only knows the Physical Dao. They can't even switch paths if they want to!"

The invincibles in the Human Realm couldn't all switch paths.

There was no other way!

Some warriors relied solely on the Physical Dao for combat, with no understanding of other Daos. How could they prove their Dao?

However, the later-stage cultural researchers had a great chance of successfully switching Daos, and once successful, their cultivation speed would be rapid.

Indeed, cultural researchers were somewhat stronger.

After the Physical Dao shattered, the Path of the Warrior had no future unless the Physical Dao was repaired one day.

The Heaven Casting King was about to speak when over ten Eternals entered from outside.

They were the strong individuals preparing to assume the role of guardians!

Led by the Zhou family brothers.

Zhou Potian and Zhou Polong, of course, in terms of seniority, Zhou Potian was much higher, but no one mentioned it now.

"Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

The fourteen strong individuals were very polite.

All previous defiance had dissipated, and now no one dared to defy Su Yu.

Su Yu glanced at everyone, nodding slightly, with a smile on his face. Compared to before, Su Yu had been much more polite to everyone recently, smiling more, unlike before when he would scold at the drop of a hat.

However, when he smiled, everyone actually felt more uneasy.

When Su Yu smiled, he seemed very kind, but in reality, it was better when he was domineering. At least everyone knew what he was thinking.

Now, you had no idea what Su Yu was thinking.

He might be smiling and suddenly decide to kill you.

Su Yu didn't care what they thought, smiling, "I see that all of you have completed some basic Weapon Fusion Method, which counts as stepping into the door of the Great Dao!"

"It's been almost three months since the last battle, and it's time for us to get down to business."

"Everyone, please enter!"

With a casual wave, Su Yu's Mark of Civilization appeared, opening a portal. Everyone looked at it, feeling uneasy.

Entering someone else's weapon was the most terrifying thing.

They knew this was Su Yu's Mark of Civilization.

But there was no choice. So many Eternals going out without some cover would cause too much commotion.

Zhou Polong was the first to step forward, directly heading towards the void portal. Su Yu chuckled, "Once inside, everyone, please restrain all your auras. Do not move unless the portal is opened, and do not let anyone discover you!"

Everyone agreed, quickly entering.

Su Yu closed the portal, then sealed it with several layers.

Although there were still some faint auras leaking out, it wasn't too obvious. As long as there was no fighting, no one should be able to sense it.

After storing them away, Su Yu looked at the Heaven Casting King again, speaking slowly, "Heaven Casting King, there's one more task for the upcoming weapon crafting!"

"Emperor Yu, please instruct!"

The Heaven Casting King knew there was a task. Otherwise, Su Yu wouldn't have called him here.

But there were already so many tasks. Was there more?

Su Yu smiled, "The next task is minor. Please assist my teacher and others in crafting 9,699 pages of the Civilization Book for me! All should reach the Earth-tier level, and Dean Hu Xiansheng will assist by cutting space, cutting the small realms we've destroyed! If the realm shatters, so be it!"

"..."

Minor task?

9,700 Earth-tier weapons!

Minor task!

The Heaven Casting King's face turned purple. Don't joke around.

He might really die!

At this moment, Zhao Li and Zhao Tianbing arrived together from outside. Zhao Li called out from afar, "We'll handle it ourselves! After all, we trust our own people more. Outsiders aren't very reliable!"

"..."

The Heaven Casting King wanted to curse!

After all this, crafting so many Heaven-tier weapons for you, and I'm still considered an outsider?

But if you say you're not an outsider, then you have to work!

It's not 97 pieces; it's 9,700 pieces!

Crazy!

The entire Human Race couldn't gather 9,700 Earth-tier weapons.

The Heaven Casting King immediately said, "It's not that I'm unwilling, but we're lacking materials..."

Su Yu didn't say anything. With a casual wave, countless materials appeared, including pots and pans, floor tiles, red bricks, tables, and benches, all looted from the eighth floor.

Not all could be used as carriers!

But crafting Earth-tier weapons wasn't a problem.

There were many, many!

The entire hall was filled. Su Yu smiled, "No worries, I lack everything but these materials! Plus, the small realms are being looted, and there are plenty of auxiliary materials!"

Su Yu continued, "9,699 pieces will do. No need for 9,700!"

Does it make a difference?

The Heaven Casting King roared internally!

Does it make a difference?

He immediately said, "But according to Emperor Yu, even if we work overtime to finish the other weapons, it will take at least three months! We could craft until Anping Year 353. To craft 9,700 Earth-tier weapons, even if we assemble ten a day, it would take three years..."

He looked at Su Yu, three years of crafting just for you?

Su Yu smiled, "It won't take that long, you're exaggerating! Some tasks for the parts can be given to other Earth-tier casting masters, even Profound-tier casting masters! This time, once the crafting is complete, there will definitely be casting masters in the Human Realm advancing to Heaven-tier casting masters, and a large number of casting masters advancing is certain!"

"Once they advance, the crafting speed will naturally increase!"

Su Yu smiled, "So, I think, within a year, it will definitely be completed. Maybe even in half a year... Let's do this, give the Heaven Casting King a year. I believe 9,699 Earth-tier level Civilization Books will be in my hands!"

"..."

The Heaven Casting King really wanted to cry. This scale was a bit frightening!

Adding to Su Yu's previous 301 items, my heavens, ten thousand Earth Soldiers.

No, in fact, many of Su Yu's 301 pages have already been upgraded to Heaven Soldiers, such as those of the Spirit Race, Golden-winged Roc, Immortal Race, Devil Race, and God Race... these pages are all Heaven Soldiers now! As for the Mark of Civilization itself, it is currently at the peak of Heaven Soldier level, transitioning towards Divine Soldier.

Su Yu even plans to integrate ten thousand carriers, elevating all the pages to the Heaven Soldier level. In that case, the Mark of Civilization will surely surpass the Book of Time, and with the fusion of myriad virtual avenues, it will reconstruct the path of the myriad realms!

Su Yu's ambition surpasses even that of the Time Sage!

He has already thought it through. If the Time Sage has lost the Book of Time, or if it becomes unusable, Su Yu will find a way to integrate it himself. As it stands, Su Yu can vaguely utilize the Book of Time!

Back then, the Time Sage dared not exterminate the myriad races, as there were too many rulers of laws present. He could only stealthily kill a few. But Su Yu... has no such reservations!

The avenues within the Book of Time are too illusory, which is unacceptable. Su Yu is genuinely prepared to slaughter a large number of defiant realms and integrate them into his Mark of Civilization.

As Su Yu contemplated these matters, King Tianzhu said bitterly, "Alright, I shall follow orders!"

It was over; he would be forging weapons until he was sick of it!

Su Yu chuckled, turning to Zhao Li and Zhao Tianbing, and said, "Teachers, I'll have to trouble you with this task. I truly don't have the time to forge weapons myself; it takes far too long!"

No matter how skilled Su Yu was, even if he could forge three Earth Soldiers a day, it would still take nearly ten years. He wouldn't be able to do anything else!

Zhao Li replied solemnly, "No problem! You focus on the big matters; we'll handle these minor tasks! Don't worry, I've advanced to a Heaven Soldier Master, so I'll keep an eye on things. No one will be able to tamper with anything, and I'll also keep a close watch on King Tianzhu!"

He spoke directly, essentially warning King Tianzhu not to play any tricks.

To avoid embarrassment!

Weapon forgers have this bad habit!

They can't help but leave some backdoor in the weapons they forge.

King Tianzhu smiled wryly, "Zhao Li, even if I have such habits, I wouldn't dare leave any backdoors in the Emperor Yu's weapons. You... really are something!"

Zhao Li responded sternly, "Better to speak harsh words now than to fall out later!"

"Rest assured!"

King Tianzhu said no more.

And Su Yu, smiling, thought that some things didn't need to be said by him; Zhao Li could handle it. Leaving backdoors was indeed a bad habit of weapon forgers, but Su Yu couldn't say too much. If you worry about others leaving backdoors, then don't let them do the work.

The main reason for inviting King Tianzhu was precisely for this.

Su Yu quickly added, "Also, regarding the integration of blood essence, try to incorporate some Eternal blood essence. If that's not possible, then Sunmoon. Anything below Sunmoon is unacceptable unless that race doesn't have Sunmoon... otherwise, it's a no-go! I'll inform the front lines that even surrendering races must provide some blood essence for me!"

The group nodded, and King Tianzhu sighed. Eternal blood essence was even harder to integrate!

Thinking of this, he suddenly recalled something and said with a hint of schadenfreude, "Emperor Yu, is Hu Xiansheng going to cut the space alone?"

At least we have many people working together.

Hu Xiansheng, cutting 9,700 pieces by himself, would be a death sentence.

Su Yu laughed, "I'll visit the Space Ancient Beast Race later. They're adept at this. If possible, I'll have them provide some assistance."

King Tianzhu couldn't find joy in this. Well, in that case, Hu Xiansheng wouldn't be as busy.

After delegating these tasks, Su Yu felt quite pleased.

The Mark of Civilization, this weapon of proving one's path, was what Su Yu intended to use to prove his own path.

The Culture King's path, no matter how strong, was still the Culture King's.

What if one day he and the Culture King met and turned against each other?

Wouldn't that be leaving himself at the mercy of others?

Prepare for the unexpected!

Anything is possible!

He must walk his own path. If the successors do not surpass their predecessors, why cultivate at all? Now is the perfect opportunity. Under normal circumstances, where would you go to slaughter the myriad races?

In the Culture King's era, the Time Sage had to act stealthily, and even then, he encountered trouble. The Time Sage's troubles were likely related to this.

But Su Yu is doing it openly now!

Su Yu's ambition is not small. He also wants to open a River of Time. Since the Celestial River of Death and the Flesh Avenue exist, and the Time Sage has given Su Yu some inspiration, why can't Su Yu surpass his predecessors?

You opened the Heaven Gate, and so did I. No one is inferior to anyone else.

Moreover, the Time Sage and others sought help, indicating that the enemy was unimaginably strong. If Su Yu becomes the second Culture King or the second Time Sage, can he really solve the problem?

He promised White Dog!

Su Yu knows himself well—cunning, selfish, suspicious of everything... he has many flaws, but he won't be ungrateful.

Anyone who has helped him won't suffer losses.

Even Liu Hong, Su Yu didn't stop him from going to the Death Realm to find Mo Dao. If he really wanted to stop him, he would have done so long ago, because Liu Hong had helped Su Yu with the Culture King's Order.

Since he promised White Dog, and has benefited greatly from the Time Sage and the Culture King, Su Yu will definitely go find them.

Even if the road ahead is fraught with danger!

With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu smiled and said, "That's all for now, teachers. You may return!"

King Tianzhu and Zhao Tianbing quickly left. Zhao Li walked to the entrance of the grand hall, turned back to look at his registered disciple. At this moment, Su Yu still wore a smile, but Zhao Li saw a hint of fatigue.

He looked at Su Yu, frowned, and said solemnly, "Don't put too much pressure on yourself. The Human Race's current plight isn't your doing! The incompetence of our predecessors has harmed the Human Race. If the Upper Realm truly opens... fight if you can, flee if you can't. You have the strength to escape!"

"With external threats and internal strife, you've progressed too quickly. We can't help you much. You're surrounded by the likes of the Great Zhou King, those old schemers who may not even respect you. You've already done your utmost!"

Zhao Li spoke earnestly.

His disciple was worthy of leading the Human Race. People say he's domineering, cold-blooded—what a joke. Without being domineering and cold-blooded, would the invincible Human Race submit to him?

Would anyone listen to reason?

If you can't suppress internal strife, how can you resist external enemies?

Since Su Yu left the Great Xia Prefecture, he's been constantly on the move, constantly fighting, never resting for a single day. Zhao Li has seen it all, remembered it all.

Time and again, he narrowly escaped death!

The first half-dead spirit in the history of the Human Race!

Did Su Yu want to become this half-dead spirit?

He was forced into it. Now, some people think being half-dead is great because it allows entry into the Death Realm. Why didn't anyone say they wanted to become half-dead back then?

"Teacher... I'm fine."

Su Yu smiled, and Zhao Li looked at him, "In front of others, you can be confident, maintain the mindset of having victory in hand. But in front of me, you don't need to. I've heard about the Upper Realm, dozens to hundreds of Daofuse! Maybe even more! No matter how much you plan, does the Human Race have that many Daofuse to use?"

"If you truly can't win, escape. I believe you have a way to survive!"

Zhao Li looked at him, "People say you're cold-blooded, but I know your blood is hot. You're too foolish, insisting on taking on this mess! It does you no good, yet it drags you into the mire!"

Zhao Li mocked, "The Great Zhou King and the others are capable, so why can't they pacify the myriad races? Even now, I still hear rumors that you're disrespectful to these Human Race Eternals, that you're young and arrogant! Don't worry about it. I've noted these people down, and I've given the list to Xia Longwu. They'll be sent to fight in the myriad realms. If they survive, it's luck; if they die, it's deserved!"

Zhao Li looked at him and added, "If you must do it, don't do it yourself and bear the infamy! Summon Wan Tiansheng back and let him be your blade. Kill all who refuse to submit. It's not his first time doing it!"

"Don't wield the knife yourself; keep your name clean!"

Zhao Li continued, "Wan Tiansheng would be happy to do it. He can't return now, but you can summon him back in the name of war. Having a trusted person by your side, Old Wan, after all, is a mentor of your lineage, including Yun Chen and Nan Wujing. Don't worry about what others think, give them more benefits in private, show some favoritism..."

Zhao Li said a lot.

He saw the fatigue and helplessness in his student. The Upper Realm has seventy to eighty, maybe even a hundred Daofuse. Can you just fight your way up there?

Can you just scheme them to death?

How many Daofuse does the Human Race have?

You still have to suppress these allies, make sure they don't have second thoughts. Even the reliable Iron Devourer Race would abandon you when their race's survival is at stake!

No matter how prestigious Su Yu is, can he surpass the Iron Devourer Race's heritage?

For instance, even Heavendoom had to persuade the Old Tortoise not to give up halfway. Persuasion means there's a possibility, and Su Yu knows this well.

That's why he doesn't want these races and forces to suffer losses, to avoid the failure of the Hundred Battle King from becoming a cautionary tale that scares them.

The Hundred Battle King has truly put Su Yu in a tough spot!

His precedent has made many ancient races wary of getting close to the Human Race.

Su Yu not only has to bear these burdens but also the consequences of the Hundred Battle King's failure.

So Su Yu curses the Hundred Battle King more than once or twice.

...

After speaking for a while, Zhao Li left quietly.

Su Yu sat on the throne, lost in thought for a while. After a long time, he chuckled. In this world, there are still people who understand him.

When he was weak, these people helped him, supporting him all the way to where he is today.

"Emperors... are always lonely."

Su Yu recalled a line from some book, loneliness lies in being misunderstood.

This time, leaving, who knows when he can return, or if he can return at all.

Every departure should be treated as a farewell.

Conquering the Death Realm, suppressing the North Heavenly King, breaking through small realms, any slight misstep could lead to death and the end of his path!

"So tired..."

Su Yu murmured, then quickly smiled, exuding the same confidence as always, stepping into the air, leaving the sacred land.

To outsiders, he is only seen as strong and confident!

...

Xia Longwu furrowed his brows slightly but quickly regained his composure, choosing not to dwell on it further.

At this moment, they had just conquered a small realm and were recuperating, preparing for the next battle. Over ten million troops were divided into countless camps, resting.

The Martial Dragon Guards.

The elite guards of the Great Xia Prefecture, now fully integrated into the Myriad Realms Conquest Army, no longer distinguished by prefecture. The Martial Dragon Guards were merely one of the elite corps within this massive army.

In the Martial Dragon Guards' camp, within a tent belonging to a centurion, Chen Hao was busy organizing combat assignments. Suddenly, his vision blurred, and the centurions around him froze in place. Chen Hao's expression changed, and he instinctively reached for his saber. But then, his eyes twitched slightly, and he broke into a foolish grin. "Why are you here?"

"Promoted to centurion, I see?"

Su Yu emerged from the shadows, his white robe as pristine as snow. Chen Hao chuckled, "Yeah! The higher-ups value me. Plus, I've advanced to the seventh level of the Skysoar Realm, so they gave me a centurion position. Not bad, right?"

Su Yu smiled and took a seat, looking at Chen Hao, his childhood friend who had grown up with him. They were the same age, yet Chen Hao now sported a beard, appearing more mature.

Still as honest and straightforward as ever... or so it seemed!

Su Yu remarked, "Your advancement isn't slow; already at the seventh level of the Skysoar Realm."

"Not bad. I killed a few strong enemies and got some rewards."

Chen Hao poured him a cup of tea and asked, "What brings you here?"

"Just passing by on some business."

Chen Hao nodded, looking at his playmate with a grin. "Tired?"

"Not really."

"It's a pity I can't help you. Otherwise, just say the word, and we'll fight whoever you want!"

Chen Hao laughed, "My dad used to say, 'Listen to Su Yu, and you won't go wrong!' I wish I could follow your lead, but now... it's not possible. Ah Yu, you have to carry the burden yourself."

That single sentence made Su Yu feel a sudden urge to cry.

He quickly composed himself and smiled, "It's fine, I can handle it! I'm invincible in battle. But you, you never came looking for me."

"Why would I?"

Chen Hao chuckled, "You've got too many powerful people around you. If I went to find you, I'd just be a burden. My dad even beat me once, telling me to keep my distance from you, to not let anyone know we're close. Things are good as they are now."

Su Yu laughed, "Don't you feel left out? I'm so strong now, yet I haven't given you any benefits?"

"Not at all!"

Chen Hao grinned, his smile carrying a hint of shrewdness. "Those who grow stronger become your fighters, participating in peak battles! We know you too well. It's bound to be extremely dangerous. The stronger ones, when the war starts, are the first to die. You not giving us benefits is just your way of letting us live a bit longer, isn't it?"

Chen Hao laughed heartily, "Don't worry. After your strong ones finish fighting, it'll be our turn. If anyone's going to die, it'll be you first. I'll definitely outlive you."

Su Yu chuckled, "Wishful thinking!"

He took a sip of tea and gestured for Chen Hao to sit. Chen Hao pulled up a stool and sat beside him.

As Su Yu drank his tea, he said, "Everyone knows who's around me. My teachers, my father, my friends, everyone knows!"

"Except you... Since we entered the academy, we haven't been in touch much. Now, everyone else is famous, but you're just an ordinary centurion, unknown to the world."

"Since we were kids, I've known you're smart... though a bit less than me."

Chen Hao grinned.

Su Yu continued, "I'm doing big things, as we used to say when we were kids, things that could get me beheaded, things that could change the world. If I succeed, I'll be remembered forever; if I fail, I'll be worth nothing!"

Chen Hao nodded, grinning, "I know. If you succeed, you'll be an emperor! If you fail... not even your body will remain!"

Su Yu nodded, "Exactly! So, when I have free time, I wonder if it's worth it. But whatever, who cares! If I lose my head, it's just a scar the size of a bowl!"

Su Yu laughed, "Enough about that. Your brother here is doing big things. If I don't die, I'll enjoy life. If I die, everything turns to dust! My dad, your uncle, I'll leave him to you! I'll tell you where he's hiding. If I look like I'm about to die, take my dad and run..."

"I'm not giving you any benefits, too eye-catching. Haozi, I'll teach you a technique!"

Chen Hao looked at him, and Su Yu chuckled, "A method to change your bloodline! A way to alter your appearance! Just this one thing. I won't teach you anything else. Whatever you can achieve on your own, you achieve! If it comes to the end, and I lose, you and my dad change your bloodline and appearance! Making you stronger is useless; you can't keep up with me. If I die, you'll definitely die! Not teaching you gives you a chance to live! If I succeed, there will naturally be benefits, and lying down to receive them is better than licking blood off the blade!"

Chen Hao grinned, saying nothing.

Su Yu added, "Outside, don't avoid our relationship too much. People know about our childhood, but don't say too much. No need to overdo it!"

"Just acknowledge we know each other from childhood. I might not even remember who you are!"

Chen Hao nodded.

Su Yu said nothing more, tapping his finger on Chen Hao's forehead. He transmitted some knowledge, sealing part of it. Su Yu smiled, "I've sealed some things in your mind. If the seal breaks one day, it means I'm dead! Haozi, at that time, find a way to return to the Human Realm immediately! Find my dad, and use the secret passage I've left to leave the Human Realm!"

Yes, Su Yu had left some contingencies, hoping they would never be needed.

A centurion, someone no one would pay attention to.

In this era where even Daofuse cultivators die like dogs, what is a Skysoar Realm cultivator?

Even Sunmoon cultivators are nothing!

Being weaker is better; being strong is actually worse. If defeated, being strong will draw attention. Just being at the Shanhai or Sunmoon level is enough; no one will care about them.

A hidden invincible is the real danger. The contingencies left by the Great Zhou King, in Su Yu's view, are unreliable.

If the Human Race is defeated this time, the myriad races will surely search all realms for humans, leaving no chance for the Human Race.

So, the three hidden invincibles are a joke.

If truly defeated, there will be no chance.

Chen Hao silently memorized Su Yu's words, absorbing the knowledge transmitted into his mind, and nodded, "Got it! Don't worry, if the seal breaks, I'll run, hide my name, and change my bloodline."

"Alright, thank you."

"We're brothers."

Chen Hao grinned, "No need to thank me. Besides, we might not even need it! You've always been the best, and this time is no exception. My dad says you won't suffer any losses!"

Su Yu laughed, "About your parents..."

"If I can take them, I will. If not... I'll send your uncle away first, then go back for my parents!"

Chen Hao laughed, "If you're not around, I'll prioritize your side. Just worried your uncle won't listen to me... I'll knock him out if I have to!"

Chen Hao chuckled, "If you have things to do, go ahead. Don't stay here too long."

Su Yu nodded, stood up, and after a moment's thought, transmitted, "Be careful yourself. Don't let me be fine while you end up dead! You're not stupid, don't pretend to be. Be a bit more cowardly, avoid the tough ones!"

"Got it, don't worry!"

Chen Hao laughed, "You still don't trust me? We fought so many times as kids, and I never lost. At worst, my dad would beat me! Our classmates were idiots. I'd beat them, my dad would beat me, and they'd be happy. My dad beating me is his business; me beating them, I'm not their dad. Those fools deserved to be beaten by us!"

Su Yu chuckled.

It was true. As kids, Chen Hao fought countless times. Every time he won, the other side would tell their parents, tell the teacher, and his dad would take him to apologize, giving him a beating!

Those kids would see Chen Hao getting beaten, wailing like a ghost, and all their grievances would vanish. In the end, it was the other parents who would intervene, saying not to beat the child so much, it wasn't right.

In reality, Chen Hao would beat them up, get beaten by his own dad, and nothing would happen. He'd even earn the nickname "Little Tyrant" or "Simpleton," and no one dared to mess with him!

Getting beaten by his own dad, would he lose a piece of flesh?

"Alright, as long as you know what you're doing, I don't need to teach you."

Su Yu laughed, "I'm leaving, but still, take care of yourself!"

"You too!"

Su Yu said no more, disappearing in an instant.

The centurions who had been frozen seemed unaware of anything, resuming their conversation as if nothing had happened.

Chen Hao continued the previous topic, acting as if nothing had occurred.

His face maintained that honest smile, and the centurions were very satisfied. This young centurion, despite his youth, was quite capable and open to suggestions, much easier to deal with than other centurions.

...

Everything happened quietly.

Iron Devourer Realm.

Su Yu arrived secretly. June and September did not make a grand welcome this time.

In the Iron Devourer Palace.

June looked at the six similar-looking fellow clan members before him and said solemnly, "Emperor Yu values you. You are to guard the Celestial River of Death! Follow Emperor Yu's arrangements in all things!"

"Understood!"

The Iron Devourers, each holding a large bamboo, nodded in unison, no problem!

Su Yu smiled, "Then, enter my Mark of Civilization for now!"

A portal opened, and the Iron Devourers quickly entered without a word.

The Iron Devourer Race provided six members, and with those from the Human Race, there were exactly twenty.

Su Yu quickly stood up, "I won't stay long. September, advance as soon as possible."

"Alright!"

September nodded, having made rapid progress recently.

Su Yu, stepping on the River of Time, soon vanished.

June watched for a while, taking a deep breath. This Emperor Yu was becoming more formidable. Hopefully, this time, everything would be worth it!

...

Hou Realm.

Four strong members of the Hou Race quickly entered Su Yu's Mark of Civilization. Su Yu continued his journey, heading to the Five Elemental Realm.

...

Within the Five Elemental Realm.

Chapter 690: The Gathering of Guardians

In the realm of the Five Elemental Race, eight powerful beings swiftly entered. Su Yu lingered a bit, assisting the Earth Ancestor in walking the path of fusion, teaching them until they understood. Only then did he depart.

Thirty-two powerful beings had been gathered, but three more were needed to complete the liberation of all the guardians. Su Yu set his sights on the Space Ancient Beast Clan for these final three.

This clan was more reliable than the Ancient Giant Clan, with whom Su Yu had never interacted and thus did not trust. Moreover, Su Yu needed the Space Ancient Beast Clan to provide him with some space fragments.

...

In the realm of the Space Ancient Beast Clan, their numbers were few, similar to the Hou Pseudo Emperor's clan, with a population barely reaching a thousand.

When Su Yu suddenly appeared in their realm, the Space Beast Emperor was deeply shaken but remained silent. However, when Su Yu mentioned needing three Eternal initial to mid-stage experts to serve as guardians, the Ancient Beast Emperor couldn't help but express his shock.

"Does Emperor Yu mean that the other thirty-two have already been gathered?"

Su Yu nodded. "Yes, they are gathered. Now, only three more are needed! I aim to liberate the high-tier combat power. Once these guardians can advance to Daofuse, I will have over thirty Daofuse experts, enough to barely contend with the Upper Realm!"

The Space Beast Emperor was internally shaken. Silently and without fanfare, Su Yu had indeed mobilized over thirty Eternals, agreeing to serve as guardians of the Death Realm. This was no simple feat. It seemed that the Iron Devourer Race and even the Human Race had truly submitted!

After a moment of contemplation, the Ancient Beast Emperor quickly nodded. "No problem! We can provide three Eternals. If needed, we can even dispatch a few more..."

Su Yu smiled. "No need. However, I do have another request. Please help me cut some space fragments and deliver them to the Human Race."

"Alright!"

The Space Beast Emperor agreed readily, realizing he needed to reassess this new Human Emperor. Su Yu's willingness to replace the guardians carried a deeper meaning. The Death Realm was no longer as dangerous. Otherwise, such replacements wouldn't be possible. Even Grandstar wouldn't agree to it!

Now that Grandstar had agreed, what did it signify? It meant the Death Realm posed no significant threat anymore, and some initial to mid-stage Eternals could completely suppress it. That was the core of the matter!

...

Even as Su Yu departed with the three Space Ancient Beasts, the Space Beast Emperor remained in shock. He knew a great war was imminent. Su Yu truly intended to initiate a war, even planning to ascend to the Myriad Realms. This new Human Emperor was not just ordinarily bold.

...

At this moment, Su Yu cared little for what others thought. Thirty-five guardians were now complete! If these thirty-five could truly advance to Daofuse, he would have enough power to ascend to the Myriad Realms!

However, their advancement would not be easy.

"North King..."

"Death Spirit Marquis!"

Su Yu pondered silently, considering capturing disobedient Death Spirit Marquises, including the North King, and bringing them into the Luminous Domain Mansion for the guardians to kill. That was the quickest way to advance!

"If there aren't enough Death Spirit Marquises, then capture more from the Celestial River of Death until there are enough. Ideally, push all the guardians into the Daofuse Realm!"

However, if he did so, the guardian faction would become too powerful! Weighing the pros and cons, Su Yu decided not to dwell on it for now. The immediate priority was to strengthen his side continuously, as the death of Tiangu and others might prompt the Upper Realm to open directly!

Soon, Su Yu arrived at Grand Dream City, beginning to gather the guardians for a meeting. The ten-thousand-year imprisonment was about to be lifted!

Old Turtle was also incredibly excited, as his old comrades could finally be freed! As for himself, there was no rush. He would wait until Su Yu truly stood at the pinnacle.

Soon, the grand formation previously set up by the West King's Consort proved useful once more. It allowed for the replacement of guardians without being spied upon. Su Yu had to admit, the West King's Consort was truly a good person! She had spent a great deal of effort to set up an excellent concealment point for him. Good people deserved to live a few more days!

From this day on, Su Yu and Old Turtle began to continuously relieve some guardians of their duties, appointing new ones in their place. The Myriad Realms enjoyed a rare period of peace, with no wars above the Eternal level.
