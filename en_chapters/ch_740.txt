Chapter 740: The First Detonation (Seeking Subscriptions)

The six Heavenly Sovereigns had arrived at the Source of the Dao. They split into three groups, advancing towards the depths with an encircling momentum. Each of them exuded an immensely powerful aura. At this moment, Mo Tianzun's voice echoed through the void, laced with a force of shock and a hint of coldness: "All living beings within the Source of the Dao, gather at the Western Myriad Races Mountain!"

"From this day forth, the Source of the Dao is sealed. No living being is permitted entry!"

His voice reverberated continuously in the void, causing the power of laws to surge violently. The six Heavenly Sovereigns were not here to kill. Within the Source of the Dao, aside from the human experts, other strong beings could cooperate. Killing was not their primary goal. However, if anyone disobeyed, killing was not out of the question.

At this moment, a powerful figure soared into the sky, possibly just emerging from seclusion, unaware of the situation. Hearing the commotion, he broke through the air with a mix of panic and anger, "Mo Tianzun? Does the Demon Race intend to occupy the Source of the Dao?"

Mo Tianzun couldn't be bothered to say much. In the distance, Huang Tianzun was shaking the earth, flattening some obstructive areas. Upon hearing this, he coldly replied, "The Myriad Races have already formed an alliance council. The Myriad Races are gathering. Dou Yi Marquis, you've been in seclusion too long. It's time to come out and see! Today, the God, Demon, Immortal, Ancient Giant, Destiny, and Iron Devourer Races have come to inform you. If you have any objections, speak at the Myriad Races Mountain!"

As he spoke, another group entered the Source of the Dao. The six Heavenly Sovereigns were not alone; these newcomers were elites from various major races, including several Heavenly Kings and more than a dozen Daofuse Realm experts. They were mainly here to clear some troubles and assist the six Heavenly Sovereigns.

Each of these powerful figures exuded an overwhelming aura. From the Immortal Race, the Immortal Battle Marquis's voice boomed like a bell: "Fellow Daoists, a crisis from the Myriad Races is upon us. The human race is rebounding, and we are in dire straits! You may proceed to the Western Myriad Races Mountain on your own. All the strong from various races are there, along with several Heavenly Sovereigns. The Source of the Dao is no longer safe!"

"To cleanse the remnants of the human race, the Myriad Races Council has decided to soon sweep the Upper Realm, flattening all places where humans might hide. We hope you will understand for the sake of the future!"

...

With the voices of several top experts, some Daofuse Realm beings within the Source of the Dao felt helpless and prepared to leave. It seemed this place was no longer tenable. This was also the consensus of several major races. While we are engaged in slaughter and war, some people want to enjoy themselves in the Source of the Dao. This cannot be allowed.

Everyone was driven to the Myriad Races Mountain. Once there, even those who didn't want to fight would have to join the battle! With the arrival of the six Heavenly Sovereigns, multiple Heavenly Kings, and Daofuse Realm experts, no race had the power to resist, even if they joined forces.

The six Heavenly Sovereigns did not say much more and continued to delve into the depths of the Source of the Dao. At the end of the Source of the Dao, there was also a layer of light curtain, where the power of laws was denser but also more dangerous, often causing the power of the Great Dao to be damaged due to violent surges.

...

Su Yu and Lantian did not follow. At this moment, both were hiding, silently watching those figures fly deeper. The encirclement had not yet begun, and these powerful beings would not randomly search here. As everyone flew inward, Lantian transmitted a message: "Emperor Yu, should we follow them?"

Although they had been investigating for two days, they were mainly looking for pseudo-Dao experts. They hadn't really found any true Dao experts. Speaking again, he said, "Perhaps there are indeed human experts inside. Should we bring out that skeleton to ask? After all, it's been here for a long time and has been in seclusion. It might know about other people's seclusion."

"No rush."

Su Yu glanced into the depths, where auras crisscrossed, and then looked around. At this moment, some Daofuse Realm beings were already flying out.

"We should also retreat to the periphery."

Even if the Heavenly Sovereigns searched, their speed wouldn't be that fast. The Source of the Dao was not small, and since their goal this time was to search inch by inch, it would probably take quite some time.

At this moment, those Daofuse Realm beings hadn't actually left. They also wanted to see if everyone would indeed retreat. Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair! Of course, if someone resisted and managed to stay in the Source of the Dao, some people wouldn't mind lending a hand. No one wanted to be driven away just like that. The Source of the Dao was a sacred place for cultivation.

When the humans controlled it, they didn't dare to expel all the foreign races.

...

Su Yu and Lantian quickly retreated to the periphery. At this time, there was no one around. In the distance, however, a few Daofuse Realm beings gathered, seemingly waiting to watch the show, but it had nothing to do with Su Yu and Lantian. These Daofuse Realm beings weren't strong, and Su Yu had no interest in causing trouble.

With a gentle tap on the Mark of Civilization, a skeletal creature appeared. As soon as the skeleton appeared, it rasped, "Who are you people? If you're humans, why capture me?"

Su Yu didn't bother to explain. Why explain? Revealing their identity might lead to some slip-ups. He directly said, "Cut the nonsense. Do you feel it?"

The skeleton was momentarily stunned, feeling what? Soon, the skeleton sensed it. From the depths, immensely powerful auras emanated, among which six auras crisscrossed the heavens and earth, incomparably powerful.

The skeletal figure, with its hollow eyes, showed a hint of surprise: "These are... top-tier quasi-kings?"

"They're called Heavenly Sovereigns now!"

Su Yu smiled, "Six Heavenly Sovereigns, no, nine Heavenly Sovereigns, now joining forces with multiple quasi-kings to sweep the Upper Realm and kill the remaining human experts! Skeleton, I saved you. If we don't take you away, you'll be discovered and doomed!"

"Sweeping the Upper Realm?"

The skeleton trembled, unable to suppress its shock, "Has my human race... already lost the Upper Realm?"

Lantian chuckled softly, "What did you think? As I said, thousands of years ago, a Human Lord emerged, burying most of the human experts. There are only a few human experts left!"

"And you..."

"We are the new generation of humans, unrelated to the past!"

Su Yu interrupted him. At this moment, the skeleton was somewhat bewildered. What exactly had happened over these years? How had the once-powerful human race fallen to the point of losing even the Upper Realm?

The skeleton sensed it, felt those powerful auras gradually penetrating deeper. Perhaps soon, they would begin the sweep. The Source of the Dao, once the human race's territory, was now overrun by the Heavenly Sovereigns of the Myriad Races!

The skeleton looked around. Some Daofuse Realm beings did not conceal their auras. As far as the eye could see, not a single one was human! In the past, for every Daofuse Realm being of the Myriad Races, there was almost one from the human race, maintaining a balance. The Myriad Races had to join forces to match the humans.

But now... it seemed the only humans left were the two beside him.

Su Yu didn't care what he was thinking and asked, "Skeleton, to your knowledge, are there any human experts in seclusion in the inner region?"

"I don't know..."

Su Yu smiled, "Say what you want. If you get killed later, it's none of our business! I've seen enough of you old fossils, stubborn as dead ducks, always thinking you're the best in the world and don't need anyone's help. Well, I can't be bothered to care. I'll just watch the show!"

The skeleton fell silent. Su Yu said no more, while Lantian chuckled, "He might really not know. A guy practicing pseudo-Dao, even if he reached the quasi-king realm, in that era, practicing pseudo-Dao... was either for survival, to extend lifespan, or because they were unloved, with no choice but to switch paths for cultivation..."

Practicing pseudo-Dao, in the human race of that time, was either for survival or due to low status. However, this one had previously inquired about human experts, mentioning the Third Generation Human Lord Yue Gang, suggesting a possibly high status. But perhaps his lifespan was running out, his aptitude lacking, unable to advance further, so he switched paths, hoping to extend his lifespan.

But extending lifespan, compared to being in seclusion for seventy thousand years... did something go wrong? Otherwise, being in seclusion for so many years without dying, his lifespan should have been sufficient back then.

Strange!

The skeleton did not speak. At this moment, he was observing everywhere. The Source of the Dao had changed significantly compared to the past. After seventy thousand years, even the Source of the Dao had undergone earth-shattering changes.

"So many Daofuse Realm beings from the Myriad Races..."

He murmured.

Lantian chuckled softly, "Many? Did you see wrong? How many are there here? Around us, there are only a dozen or so Daofuse Realm beings. Including those in the inner region, there are just over thirty. Is that a lot?"

Su Yu also smiled, "It's different. Didn't we say before? At the peak of the Ninth Tide, the human race, along with allied races, had about a hundred Daofuse Realm beings, and the Myriad Races about the same. During the Third Tide, both sides probably didn't have that many Daofuse Realm beings. So, thirty or so might seem like a lot to Skeleton Brother."

The skeleton was speechless. After a long time, in a hoarse voice, he asked, "Are there many Daofuse Realm beings now?"

"Of course!"

Lantian grinned, "As for the Myriad Races, I think there are three hundred! Over at Chaos Mountain, probably not few either, maybe a hundred? Add in the Death Realm, the Lower Realm, ancient beasts... altogether, I think there are five or six hundred! And that's after many have died. Otherwise, there would be six or seven hundred!"

The skeleton was somewhat shaken, "So many... all from the Myriad Races?"

"Pretty much!"

"Then... hasn't the human race been completely wiped out?"

The skeleton was puzzled. With so many enemies, there were still humans left. The two before him were both very strong.

Lantian didn't respond, but instead chuckled, "Skeleton Brother, during the Third Tide, were there not many Daofuse Realm beings among the humans and Myriad Races?"

The skeleton was silent for a moment before speaking, "Not many. At that time, the human race had about fifty Daofuse Realm beings. The Myriad Races had slightly more, about sixty or seventy... over a hundred."

Clearly, over the years, the number of Daofuse Realm beings had increased. This was mainly due to the rise in pseudo-Dao practitioners, the downfall of the human race, the Myriad Races' unrestrained development, and the reduction in large-scale wars, resulting in fewer Daofuse Realm beings falling.

In the previous nine tides, the Ninth Tide was the decisive battle. But in the earlier tides, there were wars, even if not on the scale of hundreds of Daofuse Realm beings clashing, battles involving dozens of Daofuse Realm beings did occur.

"That's not many."

Lantian nodded. If the number of Daofuse Realm beings during the Third Tide was considered, the current human race could still give the Myriad Races a fight.

It's a pity that it's not the Third Tide now.

"You all..."

Lantian interrupted with a smile, "Don't ask. So many things have happened over the years, there's no way to explain it all at once. It would only add to your worries! If you survive, I'll tell you slowly when there's time."

The skeleton thought for a moment and said nothing more. Indeed, according to what these two said, it had been seventy thousand years since his era. Countless events had transpired in those seventy thousand years, and it was impossible to explain everything in a short time.

The skeleton looked into the depths, sensing numerous powerful auras dispersing at the end of the Dao Source Land. Perhaps, as the white-haired young man beside him said, they were beginning to clear out the Dao Source Land.

After a moment of silence, the skeleton spoke, "Did you release me to ask me something?"

Su Yu smiled, "Didn't I say? If there's anything to ask, it's whether you know if there are any humans still in seclusion deep inside. Surely you don't expect us to ask you when the Human Emperor and Culture King will return?"

The skeleton was speechless.

After pondering for a while, as if recalling something, he finally said, "There might be. When I went into seclusion, it was said that some were in deep seclusion. However, at that time, the myriad races and humans were equally powerful. Even if both sides knew, they didn't investigate deeply to avoid causing disturbances."

Alright, another one who knows nothing!

Just as Su Yu was about to put him away, the skeleton was startled, "Can I stay outside a bit longer? If you need to act, you can let me enter the weapon space!"

He wanted to stay outside a bit longer.

It had been too long!

So long that he was completely unfamiliar with this world!

Su Yu chuckled, not minding.

Alright, I'll let you look a bit longer.

After all, he was a pseudo-Dao Heavenly King. Maybe he could recover, and if he behaved, that would be enough. As for anything else, there were no expectations.

At this moment, Su Yu looked into the depths.

A small Heaven Gate flickered in his eyes, not fully revealed to avoid being sensed by those inside. He wanted to see if these guys could bring out some strong individuals.

With March here, it wasn't too dangerous.

Moreover, he had buried two big surprises. If they exploded, there might be a good show to watch.

...

In the depths.

Six Heavenly Sovereigns were divided into three groups.

March and Mo Tianzun formed one group, Tianming and Huang Tianzun another, and Thunderstorm and Moon Tianzun the last.

The three groups of strong individuals also brought some Daofuse Realm cultivators.

At this moment, Mo Tianzun's group, with March feeling a bit bored, was exploring everywhere. Mo Tianzun frowned slightly, "Brother March, don't overlook any place. Probe deep underground. Some have sealed themselves for years. A slight oversight, and we might miss them!"

March laughed foolishly, "Don't worry! With so many of us, probing bit by bit, who can hide?"

Mo Tianzun said no more, sending streams of demonic energy through the ground.

Any slight obstruction was immediately shattered.

The other two groups of Heavenly Sovereigns did the same.

Huang Tianzun stomped down, causing the earth to quake, the sky to collapse, and the ground to sink, radiating far underground. If they encountered any obstruction, someone would quickly delve underground to investigate.

The Dao Source Land had existed for countless ages, and everyone had explored it. If there were truly dormant strong individuals, they would only be underground, as there were no longer any seclusion spaces on the surface.

Moreover, they had set up towers like searchlights, scanning the ground.

These were the Ten Thousand Laws Towers!

Similar to the sensing mirrors of the Great Ming Prefecture, they could detect and display any significant gathering of the power of laws or source qi.

The Ten Thousand Laws Towers scanned everywhere, leaving no place unchecked.

This time, the myriad races were serious about clearing the Upper Realm.

Soon, a Ten Thousand Laws Tower lit up red. Mo Tianzun instantly arrived, slamming a palm down on the ground, shouting, "Mo Tian of the Myriad Races Council, who is below?"

The ground shattered, and in the next moment, an aura grew from weak to strong, gradually revealing a power close to the second-tier Daofuse Realm. In a blink, a massive ape emerged, carrying a decayed aura.

Its eyes were filled with shock and confusion as it glanced around, heart pounding in fear!

So many strong individuals!

Seeing Mo Tianzun's murderous intent, despite not knowing the situation, it shouted back, "It's me... Mo Tian Marquis, it's me!"

Mo Tianzun scrutinized it, frowning slightly, "Dou Ling Marquis, you're still alive?"

The ape sighed in relief, glad to be recognized. It hurriedly said, "I was in seclusion... what is this..."

"The Myriad Races Council has been rebuilt, and the myriad races have gathered at Myriad Races Mountain..."

Mo Tianzun briefly explained, then said sternly, "Follow us and continue the sweep. Your ape race is now at Myriad Races Mountain. You just emerged, so you know nothing. Don't lose your composure!"

The ape nodded, glancing around, unable to hide its shock.

This place... why was it controlled by the three great races?

And where were the humans?

When it went into seclusion, it had been over ten thousand years. Back then, humans were still the rulers here.

Though unclear about the situation, it dared not resist.

There seemed to be many strong individuals nearby.

...

On the periphery.

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "They forced out a second-tier Daofuse! That was quick. It seems there are quite a few playing dead."

Lantian laughed, "That's normal. After so many years, some would choose to sleep when they're about to die."

The Dao Source Land was the best place for slumber.

Other places weren't suitable, lacking enough power of laws for replenishment.

Lantian continued, "Are we just going to watch? These guys are searching bit by bit. At this rate, it'll take at least five days to finish searching the Dao Source Land!"

Six Heavenly Sovereigns searching a Dao Source Land, taking at least five days, showed how meticulous they were. Normally, a quick sweep would suffice in half an hour.

Su Yu looked at him, smiling, "Where do you want to go?"

Lantian chuckled, "Now that the strong are on this side and the west, with many races migrating, it's chaotic. I want to see if I can sneak some of our people in."

Going to create avatars?

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Go give it a try."

If Lantian could infiltrate people into various races, it would be beneficial.

Lantian glanced at the skeleton, smiling, "I'll go busy myself for a while. Be careful with this guy. Though he's human, no one knows his situation. Don't give him too much source qi to recover."

Su Yu nodded slightly, and Lantian's figure flickered and disappeared.

He found the Heavenly Sovereigns' search too slow, and with the races migrating, it was a good time for him to act.

Lantian left.

For now, only Su Yu and the skeleton remained. In fact, Doubao and Flatbread were also sleeping in the Mark of Civilization. Those two could sleep anywhere, and they slept soundly.

The skeleton glanced in the direction Lantian left, then at Su Yu, his voice hoarse, "His Dao seems special."

Su Yu smiled, "It's alright."

"Your status seems high. He always listens to you."

The skeleton's murky eyes looked at Su Yu, "You haven't even asked my name. Aren't you curious about who I am?"

The skeleton was very curious!

Normally, when digging up an ancient relic, even if he had been asleep for too long and seemed on the verge of falling, shouldn't they be curious about his identity?

Moreover, if he recovered, his strength wouldn't be weak!

Yet, neither of them had asked this question before.

Su Yu smiled, "What's your name?"

"......"

The skeleton looked at him, pondering for a while before saying, "Can you tell me how the humans are doing now?"

"The Upper Realm is almost gone, but there are still many in the Lower Realm."

Su Yu smiled, "Why did you cultivate the pseudo-Dao?"

"Pseudo-Dao?"

The skeleton seemed to understand, his voice dry, "Pseudo-Dao? I don't think so... I once suggested that everyone should cultivate what you call the pseudo-Dao. Perhaps... it could summon back the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Summon back the Human Emperor?"

"Yes."

The skeleton's voice was dry, "Since you know it's a pseudo-Dao, you might know more. If everyone cultivated what you call the pseudo-Dao, strengthening it and providing enough power of laws, perhaps... it could strengthen this Great Dao and bring back the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment.

Could everyone cultivating the pseudo-Dao bring back the Human Emperor?

The Great Dao here was opened by the Human Emperor.

If they could help the Human Emperor reconnect with the Great Dao and continue to strengthen it, could the Human Emperor resume this Dao?

It's hard to say!

Even Su Yu wasn't sure what the outcome would be. It seemed far-fetched, but if they truly did it, there might be a chance.

"You seem to know a lot."

Su Yu smiled, "Do you know that the River of Time in the Dao Source Land is actually the Human Emperor's Dao?"

The skeleton's heart trembled, his voice hoarse, "You... know too?"

Su Yu smiled, "To me, the Myriad Realms hold few secrets. Besides, so many years have passed. What you considered secrets back then may not be secrets now!"

Information has a shelf life.

So many years have passed, and what shelf life is there? The information is almost obsolete, so Su Yu didn't expect these ancient relics to provide him with any intelligence.

It's not like there aren't any ancient marquises alive; the Great Zhou King has always been around, and he might not know less than these guys.

The skeleton knowing the River of Time was the Human Emperor's Dao surprised Su Yu a bit, but that was all!

Su Yu ignored him and continued looking into the depths.

The search was slow!

The Heavenly Sovereigns searched for a while and hadn't gone far.

Su Yu glanced at the routes of the three groups of strong individuals. He had buried two big bombs, and it seemed that the big bird might encounter March's group.

If they followed the current route, Moon Tianzun and Thunderstorm would encounter the divine race strong individual.

Mo Tianzun and March would encounter the big bird.

Even if a Heavenly King went mad, they might not be able to do much to a Heavenly Sovereign.

Su Yu glanced at those controlling the Ten Thousand Laws Towers. If the Heavenly Sovereigns were fine, killing these followers wouldn't be bad!

A Life Lost is a Life Gone Forever!

...

Su Yu ceased his idle chatter with the skeleton. Both of them silently gazed into the distance.

Boom!

Three hours into their reconnaissance, a thunderous explosion echoed.

In the next moment, an enormous golden bird appeared. It wasn't the pseudo-dao expert Su Yu had encountered before, but a true dao bird with three claws.

"A Golden Crow!"

Su Yu was surprised. It was a powerful member of the Golden Crow Race.

At this moment, the golden bird's aura rapidly intensified, flames erupting from its body as it shouted, "Marquis Eclipse, what are you doing? This is my seclusion ground. What is your purpose here?"

The Golden Crow's aura was overwhelmingly powerful, growing stronger by the second, yet it was also alarmed.

Why were there so many powerful beings around?

What had happened?

Marquis Eclipse, in fact, was the Heavenly Venerable Moon, though nowadays few addressed them by their original titles, preferring to use "Heavenly Venerable" instead.

Heavenly Venerable Moon and Thunderstorm both frowned. Heavenly Venerable Moon was somewhat surprised, surprised that this fellow was still alive!

However, he quickly relaxed his brow and laughed aloud, "So it's Marquis Golden Fire. Marquis Golden Fire has been missing for over thirty thousand years. I thought the Sixth Tide had claimed you..."

This Marquis Golden Fire was a formidable force. Although not yet at the level of a Heavenly Venerable, he possessed some of their traits, making him a top-tier Heavenly King.

The Golden Crow transformed into human form, donning a golden robe, and spoke with caution, "There are rules in the Land of Dao Source. One must not investigate places that cannot be seen through. My seclusion ground is protected by restrictions. Why have you broken my barrier and forced me out?"

He was somewhat annoyed.

Of course, he didn't lose his temper, as there were other powerful beings nearby!

Heavenly Venerable Moon chuckled, "It seems we really need to create some willpower fragments to inform those just emerging from seclusion of the current situation, so we don't have to explain every time!"

With that, he treated this one more courteously than the previous ape expert. Soon, a surge of willpower flowed out.

Marquis Golden Fire, after a moment, understood the situation.

His expression shifted repeatedly.

The situation in the Upper Realm had changed so quickly?

Suddenly, there was a Chaos Race and a Torchbearer lineage?

Given this, Marquis Golden Fire said no more but didn't linger either. He quickly stated, "Then I shall go to the Myriad Race Mountain to see how my Golden Crow Race fares!"

With those words, he tore through the air and left without delay.

He had been in seclusion for many years, and his race might have encountered issues. The Golden Crow Race didn't seem too formidable anymore.

...

"Marquis Golden Fire."

At this moment, the skeleton beside Su Yu glanced at the retreating Golden Crow, its voice hoarse, "This bird excels in the True Fire Dao, capable of incinerating the heavens and earth. It was once one of the top experts of the Golden Crow Race. How many quasi-kings does the Golden Crow Race have now?"

Su Yu smiled, "If he leaves, then just him. If he doesn't, then none."

"Is that so? The Golden Crow Race was once very powerful... even stronger than the Iron Devourer Race. Indeed, times have changed."

With that, he continued, "So that was Marquis Eclipse just now. I thought the aura seemed familiar! But he's much stronger than before. Marquis Eclipse is still alive. I wonder if his brother, Marquis Solar Corona, is still around."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "He has a brother?"

"Yes, and he's even stronger."

Su Yu pondered, "Then he might still be alive. Currently, among the three great races, the other two each have two Heavenly Venerables, but the God Race only has him. Perhaps another is alive; otherwise, the Immortals and Demons wouldn't be on par with the God Race. Maybe the Immortals and Demons know."

The skeleton said nothing more, casting another glance into the depths, its voice hoarse, "You're waiting here to rescue the Human Race?"

"No, I'm here to see how many old fellows the Myriad Races have hidden. My strength is weak; how dare I rescue anyone? You've seen it, six Heavenly Venerables, four Heavenly Kings, twelve Daofuse... with such strength, I can't rescue anyone."

Hearing this, the skeleton could only say, "If there's a chance, I hope the young friend can lend a hand..."

"We'll see!"

Su Yu ignored him. The skeleton felt powerless; this one was impervious to persuasion. Until now, he hadn't gleaned any useful information.

Just then, Su Yu licked his lips and smiled, "Time for a show! Another big bird is about to be discovered!"

The Golden Crow had fled, but over by March, Su Yu glanced over and saw that another big bird was about to be discovered!

Excellent!

As for March... it wasn't a big deal. March was shrewd, always playing the bystander. It was Heavenly Venerable Mo who took the lead in investigations. If trouble arose, it would be Heavenly Venerable Mo's problem.

...

At this moment, over at Heavenly Venerable Mo's side.

The Ten Thousand Laws Tower lit up once more.

Heavenly Venerable Mo repeated his old trick, swiftly advancing and striking the ground with his palm. The earth cracked, and a faint aura spread out.

Heavenly Venerable Mo's willpower quickly probed, delving underground. Soon, he saw a great bird awakening.

Seeing this bird, Heavenly Venerable Mo was somewhat surprised but quickly laughed, "The Nine-Winged Skywing Race... you're Marquis Bonewing!"

He recognized this bird!

The Nine-Winged Skywing Race was nearly extinct. He hadn't expected Marquis Bonewing to still be alive.

Below, Marquis Bonewing opened its massive eyes, still somewhat dazed, and looked up with some confusion, soon becoming clear, "It's Brother Mo Tian..."

The bird slowly spoke.

Among the strong of the Myriad Races, unless it was a life-and-death battle, they generally wouldn't fight recklessly upon encountering each other.

At this moment, the bird also sensed auras rising in the sky.

The bird hesitated for a moment but still slowly flew upward, beginning to connect with the power of the Great Dao, with some doubt, "Brother, why have you broken my seclusion ground?"

"Marquis Bonewing, you may not know, but now..."

Heavenly Venerable Mo briefly explained the situation, and Marquis Bonewing understood. So that's how it was!

At this moment, its power of the Great Dao fully connected.

And in that instant, a violent will surged into its mind!

"Slaughter!"

"Kill everyone!"

"Kill, kill, kill!"

The underhanded trick Su Yu had planted in the Great Dao erupted at this moment.

Marquis Bonewing, just connecting with the Great Dao, had its previously murky eyes turn blood-red, filled with madness.

Looking at Heavenly Venerable Mo, it seemed to see a mortal enemy.

Heavenly Venerable Mo, catching its gaze, was momentarily stunned.

What was going on?

In the next moment, a powerful killing intent exploded, boom!

The massive wings slashed through the void, attacking Heavenly Venerable Mo.

Heavenly Venerable Mo quickly retreated, shouting angrily, "Bonewing, are you mad?"

Marquis Bonewing actually attacked him!

Was it crazy?

And from a distance, March, who was just about to arrive, quickly stopped, puzzled. What was going on?

Who cares!

Whatever it was, he'd watch first.

But Marquis Bonewing was utterly mad, attacking fiercely, its powerful aura boiling over, filled with the wrath of incinerating the heavens, roaring furiously.

"Kill!"

Boom!

Heavenly Venerable Mo clashed with it instantly, shouting angrily, "Are you seeking death?"

This guy was crazy.

I didn't even attack you first, and you dare attack me. Are you seeking death?

Do you really think I won't kill you?

He struck again, suppressing the heavens, a massive demon god image appearing, instantly landing on the bird's back. The newly awakened Marquis Bonewing was no match for him!

Heavenly Venerable Mo was also furious, shouting, "What's gotten into you? Have you gone mad from seclusion?"

He suspected Marquis Bonewing had been in seclusion too long and had gone mad.

However, the fiercely struggling Marquis Bonewing was giving him some trouble. He didn't want to kill this guy outright but wanted to suppress it first.

"March..."

He called out, thinking that with March's help, suppression would be easier. Marquis Bonewing might really have gone mad. He saw the blood-red eyes of this guy.

Was it the pseudo-dao cultivation?

Pseudo-dao indeed had significant issues.

At this moment, several strong individuals nearby quickly arrived. A Heavenly King shouted, "Heavenly Venerable, we'll suppress him..."

Heavenly Venerable Mo nodded slightly. That scoundrel March was playing the bystander again!

And from afar, Heavenly Venerable Moon and the others also looked over but didn't come to help.

With so many people, dealing with a newly awakened quasi-king shouldn't be a problem.

...

Meanwhile.

Su Yu wore a smile, muttering, "Boom, blow them up!"

The skeleton instantly looked at Su Yu. At this moment, Su Yu's smile was too sinister.

He felt uneasy.

And just then, deep within, the suppressed and frenzied Marquis Bonewing suddenly had eyes that turned blood-red to the extreme.

"You forced me!"

"All of you, die!"

Boom!

With a roar, in the next moment, a massive shockwave swept across the heavens and earth. The enormous bird exploded into countless pieces!

In the sky, a brilliant firework ascended.

A Heavenly King, self-destructing just like that. Even if it was a pseudo-dao, it was a Heavenly King to others.

Boom!

The immense power of the self-destruction sent Heavenly Venerable Mo flying tens of thousands of meters, continuously spitting blood, bewildered.

Self-destructed?

Truly gone mad!

And in the next moment, Heavenly Venerable Mo's face changed. Under the power of the self-destruction, a Heavenly King-level expert had his body shattered but wasn't dead. However, the two Daofuse behind him were obliterated by the power of a Heavenly King's self-destruction!

Their seas of will were blown away!

Boom!

Two more bursts of the power of laws exploded!

In an instant, two Daofuse were dead.

A Heavenly King was severely injured!

"Bastard!"

Heavenly Venerable Mo was furious!

He suddenly looked towards March, and March, seeing his gaze, looked bewildered, saying, "I didn't expect him to self-destruct..."

Don't look at me!

How would I know he'd self-destruct? Did you know?

Heavenly Venerable Mo held his breath, almost spitting blood from anger!

Indeed, I didn't expect it either!

Weren't we talking just fine?

Damn it!

Why self-destruct?

From afar, Heavenly Venerable Moon and the others were also shaken, "What happened?"

"Why did Marquis Bonewing self-destruct?"

A Heavenly King died, and two Daofuse died too. How... how did this happen?

"Mad from cultivation!"

Heavenly Venerable Mo gritted his teeth!

At this moment, he hadn't thought too much, only feeling unlucky.

This happened to me!

Pseudo-Dao, as expected, is fraught with issues. Under normal circumstances, it's rare to experience Qi deviation!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu wore a look of regret.

Damn it!

Only one Heavenly King was seriously injured, and two Daofuse Realm experts died... What a pity, why didn't the Heavenly King get blown to pieces?

Beside him, the skeleton's gaze shifted subtly.

It's him!

He looked at Su Yu, convinced that it was his doing. How did he manage it?

What a ruthless fellow!
