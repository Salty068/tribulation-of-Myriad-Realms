Chapter 780: Unforeseen Changes

A colossal undead giant tore through the void.

At this moment, Su Yu no longer hesitated. He suddenly chuckled, "Hetu, after devouring the origin, let everyone find their own origins and tell them how to devour it!"

"Your Majesty!" Hetu exclaimed in shock, "All of them?"

"All of them!" Su Yu commanded loudly, "Everyone, find your own undead origin, devour these origins, and restore yourselves to complete undead!"

With those words, he soared into the sky!

Behind him, Hetu wanted to say more, but the waves were overwhelming, leaving him somewhat helpless. He couldn't move freely here, and only a few could truly act freely.

...

"Kill!"

Su Yu charged forward, meeting with the South King and others midway. Without waiting for them to speak, Su Yu waved his hand, a massive force sweeping them towards Hetu.

Don't cause trouble; focus on restoring your origins!

Boom!

A single hand covered the sky!

Su Yu's massive hand descended, instantly clashing with the giant wielding a trident.

It was merely a Heavenly King!

Well, a Heavenly King was indeed terrifying.

This was something Hetu had stirred up. Under normal circumstances, Hetu would eventually be skewered by the trident!

Because as soon as they clashed, Su Yu felt it.

An endless stream of power was gathering within this giant.

Drawing from the entire Celestial River of Death, the giant's source of death energy was inexhaustible.

However, the current Su Yu was no ordinary Heavenly Sovereign.

He always claimed he could rival the Hundred Battle King from six thousand years ago.

And six thousand years ago, the Hundred Battle King could fight three Heavenly Sovereigns, and one Heavenly Sovereign could handle two or three Heavenly Kings.

Now, Su Yu and his opponent had a crushing power disparity.

With a single palm strike!

Boom!

The massive palm shattered the opponent into dust, yet in the next moment, the Heavenly King giant revived, eyes filled with a hint of killing intent, speaking in an ancient common tongue, repeating incessantly.

"Seize the origin, kill!"

"Seize the origin, kill!"

Yes, repeating endlessly!

Su Yu's expression shifted slightly, a long blade appearing in his hand. The Opening Heaven Blade erupted, slicing out with a roar of mountains and seas, once again dispersing the opponent into scattered death energy. However, the opponent swiftly revived.

In an instant, he returned to his giant form.

By now, Su Yu understood, with a hint of helplessness, "Can't kill it!"

Yes, this giant, he couldn't kill it.

This giant was essentially the manifestation of the entire undead's Dao will. He couldn't kill it, only continuously destroy it, as it would keep reviving. To truly kill it, Su Yu would need the ability to sever the undead Dao!

Su Yu once again slashed the newly revived giant, shouting, "Everyone, go!"

Behind him, more were rushing over.

At this moment, Su Yu actually understood some of the operating procedures. Yes, he had guessed it.

Once someone else devoured the origin, no more giants might be born. Instead, this giant would absorb more power, growing stronger until it killed those who devoured the origin.

Spread out?

Currently, Hetu's devouring of the origin only resulted in the emergence of a Heavenly King-level existence. If more people joined, this giant would undoubtedly become stronger.

However, this giant had revived.

The next time someone came, perhaps an even more terrifying existence would appear. At this moment, the giant seemed not fully awake, mechanical and bewildered, but Su Yu could feel that its will seemed to be continuing to revive!

"Troublesome!"

Su Yu boomed, once again repelling the opponent. At this moment, he hesitated slightly, then quickly stopped killing the opponent.

At this time, Su Yu sensed the severity of the problem.

Killing the opponent seemed to make it stronger.

Moreover, it seemed to be gaining intelligence.

"I can't keep killing it; I need to seal it!"

Su Yu quickly set up a series of sealing formations. As the master of myriad Daos, although he wasn't adept at formations, he could still set up some simple sealing arrays.

Not only that, but at this moment, Su Yu wielded a massive brush, the power of the pen dao!

Su Yu had devoured a considerable amount of pen dao power, and the pen dao inherently had a sealing effect.

The four paths of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone were all prepared by the Culture King for revival, evidently knowing something, including the emergence of such an unkillable giant!

"Pen Dao, main seal!"

Su Yu sketched out formations, wielding the giant brush, swiftly sealing the giant within.

The giant roared violently, struggling!

Boom!

The massive trident continuously struck.

Su Yu sealed the giant, then looked back at the undead, shouting, "What are you standing there for? Go!"

Many undead were terrified, but they gritted their teeth and quickly flew forward, crossing the struggling giant.

However, at this moment, some undead felt a twinge of fear. An Eternal undead suddenly turned back, flying towards the opening Su Yu had created.

He wanted to go back!

Only now did he realize how dangerous it was.

A single giant was an existence he couldn't even look up to.

As a result, he hadn't flown far back when, with a boom, a massive wave crashed down, smashing him into death energy, merging into the Celestial River of Death.

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he looked over.

At this moment, the waves there had diminished slightly, even if insignificantly, Su Yu could feel it.

And this massive undead giant seemed to calm down a bit.

"Undead dying, all origins merging, what... what does this mean?"

Su Yu pondered continuously, already having a vague idea.

Hetu had stripped away the power of the origin, causing the Celestial River of Death to feel a significant loss, thus birthing an undead giant. But once other undead died and merged into it, it might cause the undead giant's power to decline, as the Celestial River of Death regained a bit.

Undead originally had about half their power remaining in the river. Now, after death, all their power merged in.

Just one Eternal undead, compared to Hetu, was still a vast difference.

So, this undead giant only calmed down slightly.

Thinking this, Su Yu quickly sealed the undead. How long this seal would last, Su Yu didn't know. At this moment, he didn't care. Su Yu swiftly flew to where everyone was, as he still needed to help them merge with their origins.

Soon, Su Yu arrived at their location.

By now, nearly sixty undead had gathered here, both strong and weak, all resisting the massive waves.

These undead included his own people and those who weren't, including some strong individuals under the North King's command and even some controlled by those in the sealed land.

Sixty strong individuals, all wanting to revive, Su Yu couldn't imagine how strong that giant would become.

Whatever!

Spread out, there won't be a chance to come again anytime soon!

"Find your respective origins!"

Su Yu shouted, and the South King and others quickly flew forward. Su Yu continued to suppress with the Starry Sky Seal, but it was clearly running low on power.

At this moment, the Heavenly King-level expert from the Fire God Clan, who had flown out of the Celestial River of Death earlier, hurriedly said, "Human expert, further ahead, the river's repulsion will be stronger, especially for living beings entering, the repulsion is even greater! Human expert, perhaps you should focus on defeating that giant, and we'll handle merging with the origin ourselves. Life and death are fated; we can't rely entirely on you..."

He felt... well, he felt that Su Yu's divided attention made him nervous.

We'll handle resisting the river's power ourselves. Human expert, please deal with that giant, or we'll be worried something might go wrong.

Su Yu ignored him.

And the South King also said solemnly, "Your Majesty, we are not children; we are strong! Merging with the origin... let us handle it ourselves! If we die, we die. Are we to be treated like children? This way, you have to divide your attention, which is not acceptable!"

The Heavenly Fire was right. Su Yu had to protect them while also dealing with that giant.

At this moment, others couldn't easily enter, or the living would be repelled, causing even greater turmoil, unless it was the final moment, which was more likely. Su Yu hadn't planned to call everyone up either.

Hearing the South King say this, and seeing the others, although some hoped Su Yu would protect them for a while, they quickly looked at the struggling giant behind them. Soon, someone said solemnly, "Your Majesty, you should focus on dealing with that giant. As for merging with the origin, we'll handle it ourselves!"

"Yes, Your Majesty!"

The newly arrived Xingyue also looked at Su Yu, saying solemnly, "You deal with that giant. Finding the origin isn't too difficult. If we can't withstand these waves, it means we deserve not to revive!"

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then nodded. Suddenly, he reached out and took the Starry Sky Seal in his hand, handing it to Xingyue, "This belongs to you. You take it!"

Xingyue was slightly stunned.

Su Yu said solemnly, "This item has been of great help to me, but it doesn't belong to me; it's yours! The Starry Sky Seal suppresses any disturbances, suppresses everything, but I've consumed a large amount of its energy, probably up to eighty or ninety percent... For now, I'll return it to you, and we'll discuss the rest later!"

Xingyue was silent for a moment, then quickly accepted it.

Su Yu looked at the others, "This originally belonged to Xingyue. I didn't want to explain, but..."

He looked at the Heavenly Fire group, coldly saying, "I hope you won't cause any disputes over this item! Xingyue, use this seal to protect yourself. Many things were prepared for you by others!"

The Starry Sky Seal, the Ink Dao, and even the Pen Dao were all intended to help Xingyue revive.

These all belonged to Xingyue.

Xingyue said nothing, and the others remained silent.

Su Yu secretly transmitted to Hetu, "Protect Xingyue well. She should be very important! Don't let anyone seize her Starry Sky Seal; it must have great use, especially for Xingyue!"

Some things are arranged by fate, by the strong.

These things should all be related to Xingyue.

Su Yu said no more, finally saying, "Then everyone... merge with your origins yourselves. I'll hold off this giant. This giant can't be killed; it will only grow stronger!"

South King and the others nodded in agreement.

Soon, the group continued their journey. Some of the Eternals turned back, as their origins seemed not to be deep within. Meanwhile, Su Yu swiftly flew towards the giant.

Boom!

Just as Su Yu approached, the giant unexpectedly broke through the seal. Su Yu's expression changed. No one had merged with their origin yet, so why had it grown stronger? It was reviving faster than anticipated!

"Damn it!" Su Yu cursed under his breath. "Whether I revive one or many, this thing just keeps getting stronger on its own?"

What a joke! So, my choice was right after all. This damned thing was strengthening itself all along, not waiting for everyone to merge with their origins to become powerful!

"Die!"

The giant, growing colder, thrust a spear at Su Yu. Su Yu swung his blade in response.

Boom!

A fierce battle erupted. Elsewhere, the entire Celestial River of Death was in chaos, with massive waves surging.

At this moment, in the sealed area, someone frowned slightly. "Emperor, the Celestial River of Death is in turmoil, and we are also affected. If this continues... cough..."

As he spoke, he spat out a mouthful of black blood. Taking a breath, he couldn't help but curse, "We're taking the blame for this!"

Indeed, the entire river's upheaval had implicated them as well.

Dizhi Luo, who had been scolded by the Lord of the Dead Spirits earlier, dared not speak rashly. But now, he couldn't hold back, "We haven't gained any benefits, yet we're bearing the blame for them?"

Frustrated!

Because the river's upheaval made them uncomfortable as well.

The Lord of the Dead Spirits said nothing, observing for a moment before suddenly declaring, "Give it your all to suppress the river's turbulence!"

Everyone was taken aback by his words.

They all looked towards the Lord of the Dead Spirits.

He ignored them, gazing at the sky, and said solemnly, "The river's turmoil is severe. Su Yu is dealing with that necromancer incarnation. Living beings cannot easily enter now, or it will cause even greater upheaval! Others are searching for their origins; if the turmoil is too strong, it will lead to their complete demise!"

Some wanted to say, let them perish then, what does it have to do with us?

However, the Lord of the Dead Spirits paid them no heed.

The next moment, a powerful aura surged from the Celestial River of Death.

At this moment, seven or eight top-tier experts broke through the air. Wan Tiansheng and the others looked serious, about to make a move, when suddenly, at one end of the river, a formidable force erupted, suppressing a thousand-meter stretch of the river's turbulence.

At this moment, the entire river became transparent.

Wan Tiansheng looked up, somewhat surprised. He glanced at the Lord of the Dead Spirits, finding him a bit peculiar, and cupped his hands, "Thank you, Emperor, for your assistance!"

The Lord of the Dead Spirits remained silent.

His power erupted again. Though sealed here, he was not much affected within the Celestial River of Death.

Under his suppression, the waves in that section of the river calmed down.

Wan Tiansheng and the others watched silently, saying nothing more.

Beside the Lord of the Dead Spirits, the other fourteen strong individuals had mixed reactions; some were displeased, while others said nothing and joined in the suppression.

Meanwhile, South King and her group were advancing. Seeing the waves ahead calm for a stretch, reducing the waves on their side as well, South King breathed a slight sigh of relief.

At this moment, Xia Chen suddenly said, "My origin is here!"

With that, he said no more and directly submerged into the river, the sound of sizzling incessant.

Xia Chen seemed to be melting!

Without Su Yu's help, merely capturing one's origin was a difficult task.

South King's expression was stern. She struck out with a palm, scattering the river water around him, and said in a low voice, "Hurry!"

"South King..."

Xia Chen trembled slightly, "You all go on without me..."

South King coldly replied, "Help the weaker ones first. Our origins are too far. Merge with your origins quickly! Hurry!"

Xia Chen dared not delay.

South King then looked at the group from Tianhuo, coldly saying, "Find your own origins. Don't follow us. Emperor Yu allowed you to enter, but... if you're not from the same camp, consider it a blessing if we don't deal with you. Find your own origins!"

Still waiting, are you expecting us to help you find them?

Tianhuo cupped his hands slightly and quickly disappeared, his origin still ahead!

Some of the other strong individuals quickly left, while others hesitated, having just seen Xia Chen's painful state. Even a strong individual like Xia Chen seemed unable to merge with his origin. A necromancer couldn't help but ask, "South King, could you help suppress it a bit..."

Bang!

Before he finished speaking, South King struck out, shattering him into pieces. Instantly, his body merged into the Celestial River of Death, a scream echoing as he vanished into the river!

South King's expression was icy, her voice cold and eerie, "Scram!"

With a low shout, the other necromancers turned pale. This South King was even more ruthless than Su Yu! Su Yu hadn't even laid a hand on them, but South King killed without hesitation!

With that, over twenty necromancers fled swiftly.

Forget it, we'll find it ourselves!

Everyone was still very afraid of South King, one of the Four Heavenly Kings since ancient times, whose authority was deeply ingrained. Who dared to say more?

South King snorted coldly, "Pushing your luck!"

She had no time to deal with them. Having swiftly dealt with a necromancer, she quickly looked at Lanshan, saying in a deep voice, "Lanshan, go help others merge with their origins. No living beings should enter here! We are the core strength of this Death Realm. We must be quick and bring everyone back to life together!"

She and Marquis Lanshan were the core strength of the Death Realm, the strongest under Su Yu's rule!

At this moment, only they could help everyone quickly merge with their origin power!

Below, Xia Chen captured his origin power. The origin power struggled violently, but with the giant blocked by Su Yu and the waves suppressed by the Lord of the Dead Spirits, the remaining difficulties were bearable.

Xia Chen's power visibly grew stronger.

Third-tier Daofuse!

Second-tier Daofuse!

Until he was about the same as Hetu, Xia Chen stopped, rising quickly with joy, "The power is strong, at least equivalent to our original power merged into the origin!"

In other words, the strong in the Death Realm only had half their power, which was a terrifying thought!

Just as he spoke, with a bang, in the distance, a Daofuse expert also found his origin power. But upon merging, he exploded, perishing instantly and merging into the Celestial River of Death!

Xia Chen and the others felt a chill. If no one helped, wouldn't they be doomed?

South King glanced over, indifferent, and quickly said, "Spread out, quickly! Lanshan, I, Hetu, and Xia Chen will form a team. Hurry, help everyone merge with their origins!"

The three groups quickly led everyone to continue searching for their origins.

Soon, Marquis Zhengyang shouted, "My origin is here!"

"Lanshan, go over!"

Marquis Lanshan quickly led people over, while the others continued forward.

At this moment, the giant Su Yu faced grew ever stronger, an undying existence!

By now, it had reached the peak power of a Heavenly King.

This creature felt just a step away from becoming a Heavenly Sovereign.

Su Yu cursed inwardly, too fast!

At this rate, it would soon become a Heavenly Sovereign!

Would it become even stronger?

To the level of a ruler of laws?

Then I... would be in big trouble!

However, the recent explosion of a Daofuse expert slightly weakened the giant's power. Su Yu understood more clearly what he needed to do this time. Dragonblood, sorry, but it seems I'm going to merge you!

Just then, the giant suddenly spoke, no longer as confused as before. Though still somewhat mechanical, it uttered words different from before.

"Bold junior, invading my Great Dao, do you wish to become my mortal enemy? The enmity of contending for the Dao surpasses all!"

The giant spoke mechanically, and Su Yu's heart trembled. He quickly replied, "Let my people go!"

"Kill!"

The giant said no more, thrusting its spear again!

Su Yu stepped back slightly, quickly punching, shattering the spear. However, his control over his power wasn't as precise as before.

Breaking its spear only caused another, stronger one to appear.

An opponent that couldn't be killed, only growing stronger when defeated, was the most troublesome!

Su Yu glanced back, shouting, "Hurry up!"

He couldn't delay any longer!

Not just this giant, Su Yu could already feel the entire Celestial River of Death continuing to revive.

The most worrying thing was about to happen.

Sure enough, at that moment, with a thunderous roar, a powerful wave surged from where South King and the others were. The waves previously suppressed by the Lord of the Dead Spirits suddenly erupted!

It wasn't intentional on the Lord of the Dead Spirits' part, but at this moment, a grand will swept through the entire river!

"My followers, kill the invading enemies!"

A grand voice echoed in all directions.

Yes, some remnants of the will of the Lord of the Dead Spirits were erupting, commanding his followers to kill!

At this moment, some of the necromancers left behind suddenly had bloodshot eyes, some clutching their heads and screaming in agony, while others struggled to maintain some composure, gritting their teeth and roaring, "Great Zhou King... not good, our... our instincts... are driving... driving us to kill His Majesty..."

Boom!

No need for further words. At this moment, some necromancers, driven mad, suddenly charged towards the gap in the sky.

And the gap was near where Su Yu and the giant were.

In the midst of battle, Su Yu, seeing this, was not alarmed but pleased. Good news!

Killing you all to quell the river's turmoil wouldn't be bad either!

In an instant, he split into multiple avatars. One avatar dealt with the giant, while another tackled the invading undead. Those he didn't recognize were slain without hesitation, while those he did recognize... well, all undead were more or less the same. Su Yu could only ensure that he recognized most of his allies above the Eternal level; those below it couldn't even ascend here.

...

In the region where the North King resided, some undead could no longer restrain themselves and began to ascend into the sky. The North King frowned slightly, forcibly suppressing the urge to kill, and said in a deep voice, "Control our people. Some of our own have gone up there!"

He subdued a Daofuse undead beside him. Dragonblood Marquis's eyes flickered, and suddenly, he punched and killed a Daofuse undead next to him, saying indifferently, "If you can't control yourself at all, what's the use of keeping you around?"

The Daofuse expert was somewhat out of control but could still barely restrain himself. Yet, Dragonblood Marquis took advantage of the situation and killed him with a sneak attack!

As he was slain, Dragonblood Marquis casually absorbed the other's power, causing the North King in the distance to frown and say coldly, "Dragonblood, what are you doing?"

He only asked you to suppress them, not to kill!

Dragonblood Marquis replied indifferently, "They are just weak-willed individuals. If they are controlled at this moment, they would be the first to surrender in a crisis. Better to kill them now!"

The North King glared at him, coldly asking, "Dragonblood, what exactly are you trying to do?"

Dragonblood Marquis, it seemed, was no longer following orders!

This guy killed a Daofuse as if it were nothing.

Infuriating!

Killing a Daofuse wasn't that simple, but at this moment, these Daofuse were being hit by tidal waves and influenced by the will of the Lord of the Undead. Coupled with Dragonblood's sudden attack, they were caught completely off guard and were killed just like that!

Dragonblood Marquis said coldly, "Lord North King, if they don't listen, they should be killed. What's the harm in that? You are too merciful!"

With that, Dragonblood Marquis smiled faintly and suddenly soared into the sky, heading towards the Celestial River of Death. Seeing that someone noticed him, Dragonblood Marquis smiled faintly and said, "I'm going to slay the out-of-control undead! If any of you human experts wish to assist me, you can join me in killing those creatures to avoid causing trouble for Emperor Yu!"

"Dragonblood!"

From behind, the North King shouted in displeasure.

But Dragonblood Marquis ignored him.

The opportunity... had come!

Yes, the opportunity.

Normally, killing a powerful undead would certainly draw attention, but now, no one cared. If he went to kill those out-of-control undead, the humans might even help him. Excellent!

Using others to kill, this was exactly in line with his intentions.

Dragonblood Marquis's eyes hid a trace of a smile. The next moment, a powerful voice echoed in the minds of all undead, accompanied by an overwhelming pressure.

"My people, slay the invading enemies, and you will be rewarded with the power of laws. The more enemies you kill, the greater the rewards!"

Those with weak willpower were directly controlled!

Those with strong willpower could still restrain themselves somewhat, but at this moment, the remnant will of the Lord of the Undead not only issued a forceful command but also offered enticing rewards, combining both grace and power!

Dragonblood was still contemplating how much reward there would be for slaying invading enemies.

Suddenly, in the Celestial River of Death, one of the undead that had entered earlier lost control. In this situation, everyone could see it. In an instant, a roughly fourth-tier Daofuse expert struck and pierced a nearby Daofuse undead, pinning it to the Celestial River of Death!

At that moment, a powerful force of undead rules suddenly emerged from the attacker.

In the blink of an eye, the attacker advanced from fourth-tier Daofuse to third-tier!

And he had only slain a fifth-tier Daofuse!

Everyone was stunned!

The Death Path... could it really discern these things?

Because they had all entered the Celestial River of Death!

No, the key was, this... this reward... was unbelievable!

Dragonblood Marquis was also stunned!

Killing a fifth-tier Daofuse and advancing to third-tier, almost a full step up, what... what was this?

"My people, kill the enemy, and you will be richly rewarded!"

"Kill those who devour the source, and the reward will be doubled!"

"Kill the strong of the alien path, and I will help you ascend to the realm of true rule masters, mastering the path of the undead, rivaling the rule masters!"

"......"

Dragonblood Marquis was dumbfounded!

Not just him, at this moment, other undead were also extremely shaken.

Killing one who devours the source, the reward is doubled.

The strong of the alien path, probably referring to Su Yu, kill Su Yu, and you directly become a rule master?

Is this for real!

Such an existence as the Lord of the Undead wouldn't deceive everyone.

...

At this moment.

In the sealed land, among the 15 strong individuals, some were eager to move, while others said helplessly, "We are sealed and can't get out!"

It has nothing to do with us unless we can stir up some trouble in the Celestial River of Death.

Dizhi Luo also sneered, "Forget it, we can't go there anyway. The source power in the Death Path isn't that strong and can't rival those like Yu Ziqi!"

He wanted to kill a strong enemy, but unfortunately, he couldn't get out!

The reward was too generous!

And for the master of the Death Path, what is the power of a rule master?

It shouldn't be fake!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was coldly watching the giant opposite him, saying indifferently, "Rule master? Your giant avatar isn't even a rule master, and you talk about rewarding others to become rule masters, how laughable. You haven't even revived to that extent!"

This guy was lying!

Otherwise, why not just make your own avatar a rule master?

However, the giant was equally cold, "Foolish creature, I haven't revived yet. Kill you, and as I gradually revive, I can naturally fulfill my promise!"

He never said he would reward immediately!

A rule master, that's all, can't afford to reward?

Of course, he can afford to reward!

"My people, kill the alien, and you will be the proxy master of the Death Realm!"

He had chosen the proxy master of the Death Realm, but the true master was still himself!

At this moment, the giant's power surged again, boom!

A force of Heavenly Sovereign emerged!

The giant's power was reviving.

With a puff, a spear pierced Su Yu, forcing him back several steps. The giant swept in with a tidal wave, causing the entire river to ripple again, waves surging to the sky.

At this moment, suddenly, in the river, an undead who hadn't lost control suddenly attacked those beside him.

With a puff, he slew the undead next to him, and instantly, his strength was enhanced. The difficulty of becoming a rule master was immense, but below that, it wasn't hard. This giant, even if his giant power was consumed somewhat, it didn't matter; his giant power was rapidly recovering!

Su Yu watched him coldly, and the next moment, he punched out, his heart anxious. Hasn't the source devouring ended yet?

The trouble will only grow bigger!

...

"Devour!"

The South King gave a low shout, and the next moment, her face changed, suddenly looking forward.

Ahead, the massive Celestial River of Death suddenly opened a gap, yes, a gap, the river split open, and at this moment, the South King's face changed completely!

Because in that split gap, she saw something she didn't want to see.

And below the split gap, someone was also stunned.

Dizhi Luo looked up at the sky, somewhat dazed, then looked at the others, muttering, "This... the river... has split! Can we... can we directly enter the river and then... unseal?"

This... is unbelievable!

This section of the river was almost at the deepest point, almost impossible to open. Otherwise, they would have already joined forces to open the river, break in, find a weak spot, and escape!

However, now the river mouth had split open.

The will of the Lord of the Undead sensed something and fulfilled them, actively opening the gap for them!

They could unseal, kill, and escape!

Dizhi Luo, in shock, the next moment, suddenly looked at the Undead Emperor, his emotions somewhat out of control, "Emperor... we... let's go in!"

Let's go in!

Alone, he didn't dare to rush in; he saw the South King and others.

But together, what was there to fear!

15 top-tier experts, the Emperor comparable to a rule master, four others comparable to Heavenly Sovereigns, and the rest comparable to Heavenly Kings.

Just the South King and Lanshan, they could kill them in an instant!

The Emperor frowned slightly, looking at the sky. He also wanted to escape, but to escape, he would inevitably clash with some people. Just as he was thinking, at this moment, Wan Tiansheng and others floated up!

Wan Tiansheng sighed, "Everyone, I hope you can avoid this battle. After this battle, we will find a way to open the seal. We will not interfere with each other. I promise on behalf of His Majesty, this battle, if you do not enter the river, our Luminous Domain Mansion will fully assist you in escaping!"

Dizhi Luo was somewhat frantic, "Does anyone believe this? At this point, the river has opened on its own. Don't forget, we are all undead, the Lord of the Undead is our only one! Are we still foolishly staying here and not escaping? Are we crazy?"

Some undead were agitated, and someone looked at the Undead Emperor.

The Undead Emperor frowned slightly, suddenly saying, "Does the Luminous Domain Mansion truly wish to help us escape?"

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "I guarantee it, and it is also the guarantee of the Emperor! At this moment, I just don't want everyone to have a conflict... it won't do us any good!"

The Undead Emperor was silent for a moment, then nodded slightly, "I... choose to believe you this time."

"Emperor!"

Someone shouted lowly, not Dizhi Luo, but a Heavenly Sovereign, who was somewhat unable to bear it, "Emperor, you... we can get out on our own!"

The Undead Emperor said calmly, "Get out? At this moment, we must fight a battle, otherwise, we can't get out! It's better to wait here, wait for the Luminous Domain Mansion to actively release us!"

"Emperor!"

Someone shouted angrily, what kind of thinking is this?

Actively going out and not going out, waiting for someone to passively release them?

"Fine, even if a great battle ensues, so what? Are we afraid? Absolutely not!"

"Everyone... do as you please!" The Nether Emperor looked up at the sky, remaining silent for a moment. "Right now, the only exit is on Su Yu's side. Going out... will inevitably lead to a battle!"

Inevitable indeed!

Among the others, some gritted their teeth, while others hesitated. What was the Emperor thinking? In truth, Wan Tiansheng was also taken aback. This Nether Emperor actually chose not to leave. This was unexpected. In Wan Tiansheng's mind, after being sealed for so many years, the Emperor would seize the opportunity to break free, even if it came at a cost. As for a great battle... to break the seal, who cares?

Yet, the Emperor believed his words. Even Wan Tiansheng was bewildered. What... what was this? What was the Emperor's true intention?

The Nether Emperor remained silent, his gaze fixed on the opening in the sky. What was his intention? It was simple: going out might mean death! Complete and utter death! Was this all an opener could do? He didn't believe it! The opponent must have other means. This was just a small test. Truly choosing to enter that opening would mean becoming a full enemy of Su Yu's side. Forget about not participating in the battle; that was impossible!

At that moment, someone shouted, "Go up!"

In an instant, eight figures flew towards the sky! Only a fool would stay! The Emperor had gone mad from being trapped! Idiots! A path to life was given, yet you refuse to take it, insisting on waiting until the seal breaks on its own? Waiting for the Luminous Domain Mansion? Ha, who would entrust their fate to others!

The Nether Emperor frowned and said calmly, "If no one breaks the seal within ten years, this seal will shatter on its own. Why rush?"

At worst, wait another ten years!

"Emperor, we... can't wait any longer!" someone roared. They couldn't wait any longer!

At that moment, Fat Ball tore through the air, a boot severing the passage. In the next moment, Fat Ball transformed into a black dog, roaring, "Kill them!"

Fat Ball was no longer benevolent!
