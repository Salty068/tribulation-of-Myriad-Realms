Chapter 756: I Wish to Open the Dao! (Please Subscribe)

Daofuse, extracting the power of the pen dao. Fuse again, extract again, then sever the dao, and extract in large quantities once severed. Su Yu was getting addicted to this process! Only he could play like this; others couldn't even fuse with the pen dao. Normally, no one would play like this. If you mess around too much, you might end up breaking your own Great Dao. Who could bear that?

Nearby, Wan Tiansheng and Marquis Tongtian watched for a while. Soon, Marquis Tongtian couldn't take it anymore and shouted, "Emperor Yu, let's head back. I can't hold on any longer!"

Only then did Su Yu step out of the pen dao, a satisfied smile on his face. Another page had been added to the Mark of Civilization. The Arrow Dao!

He glanced at Marquis Tongtian, squinting with a smile, "Your strength is average, but your material is truly excellent. You haven't been destroyed by this! I'm curious, what material were you forged from, and who forged you? Was it the Heaven Gate, or was it man-made?"

Previously, he hadn't paid much attention to these things. But today, his curiosity was piqued. A gate that could seal an era—how terrifying! Of course, Marquis Tongtian was weak now, but his essence must be quite high. Otherwise, the Culture King wouldn't have tricked him into sealing an era. Also, after sealing that era, did the people of that era die, or what happened to them?

Some things, Su Yu still couldn't figure out. Marquis Tongtian, seeing Su Yu bring this up again, wore a sorrowful expression, "I am a Heaven-born Gate, not forged by anyone. Gates exist between heaven and earth. How can man-made gates compare to Heaven-born Gates?"

Is that so? Maybe not!

Su Yu thought that it was unlikely for several gates to appear out of nowhere in this world. This guy was probably man-made, but he either didn't know or wasn't saying. However, these things were still distant concerns. Knowing a bit was enough; there was no need to delve deeply. Whether it was the Heaven Gate or the Gate of Hell, Su Yu wouldn't be able to interact with them anytime soon.

"Let's head back first!"

They had stayed here for quite some time. It was time to return.

...

After a while, Su Yu and his group returned. Everyone was slightly startled to see Wan Tiansheng. Doubao, in particular, transformed into a light sphere and flew over instantly, revealing a shadow with a confused look. What was going on?

Wan Tiansheng also looked at Doubao. Seeing Doubao staring at him, he smiled, "Friend Doubao, why are you looking at me? And... why don't you revert to your original form? Why maintain this state?"

"…"

Doubao was confused and said, "My physical body exploded."

"Friend... you're joking!"

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "Friend, you are originally formed from the rules of the Great Dao. Where does the talk of a physical body come from? The notion of a physical body is merely a fixed impression, a mental illusion that makes you feel you have a physical body. Thus, you have one... In reality, that body is also formed by the power of laws. Friend, you just lost a lot of the power of laws and are somewhat weakened."

He was puzzled. Others losing their physical bodies was one thing, but why were Doubao and Flatbread joining in the fun? Why transform into light spheres? Where did you two get physical bodies from? These two are the rules of the Great Dao, okay? Which rule of the Great Dao has a physical body?

Doubao was stunned, pondering. It had lived for a long time and knew it was a rule of the Great Dao, but did the rules of the Great Dao not have physical bodies? Then why... do I have a furry body?

Doubao said in confusion, "But... but I feel like I have a physical body, and all our clan's physical bodies are the same."

They're all furballs!

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Friend Doubao, this is the path of idealism! That is to say, you think, or rather, the Culture King thought, you should look like a furball and instilled this concept in you. As a rule of the Great Dao, you can transform as you wish, so you became a furball!"

I think you should look a certain way, so you transform into that way, and then it becomes a fixed impression. The Doubao lineage, three furballs, are actually different Great Daos. How could they be the same? Their essence is the Great Dao, not the same Dao!

Doubao was dazed again, "So, my physical body... no, I don't actually have a physical body. I'm just injured, and the power of laws has dissipated a lot, so I appear somewhat weak?"

"Exactly!"

Wan Tiansheng was also in a similar state at the moment, so he naturally understood Doubao's situation.

Doubao was in a daze for a moment, then seemed to understand. Gradually, the light sphere transformed into a big furball. It was exactly the same as before, with no signs of a shattered physical body. However, its aura was indeed much weaker. But it still appeared out of thin air. Gradually, people felt as if its physical body had recovered, but in reality, it wasn't a physical body!

Doubao, having returned to its original form, glanced at Wan Tiansheng with some curiosity. Soon, it looked at the female ball over there and shouted, "Wife, you can recover too!"

"How do I recover?"

"Just think, I have a physical body, I have a physical body... think for a while, and you'll have one!"

"Husband, is it that easy?"

"Yes!"

The couple conversed for a while. After a while, the female ball also recovered. Like Doubao, it was just somewhat weak, but its physical body had recovered.

The other light spheres were all a bit surprised. They were also thoughtful!

Rules of the Great Dao!

These two were still different from everyone else. The Iron Devourer Race was very special. The rules of the Great Dao becoming spirits were actually very rare, but the Iron Devourer Race had three of them. Now, even if Wan Tiansheng didn't recover his physical body, he could barely say he was also a spirit of the Great Dao, just retaining some memories. That was the difference between him and Doubao and the others.

These few Doubao might have been strong before, integrated into the Great Dao, and transformed into spirits of the Great Dao.

At this moment, Su Yu was merely observing. Doubao and Flatbread's recovery was a good thing. They were slightly weaker than before, but with more recovery, their injuries weren't as severe as they seemed.

Su Yu found it a bit strange, looking at Doubao. After a while, he said, "Senior Doubao, are you really the Dao of Devouring?"

"Huh?"

Su Yu frowned, "Could you be mistaken? If you're the Dao of Devouring, why do you seem different from September..."

Doubao said in confusion, "I'm not the Dao of Devouring, didn't you know?"

Su Yu was stunned, not the Dao of Devouring?

Doubao looked at him with some peculiarity, as if thinking Su Yu was a big fool, and explained, "Last time, when I fought with Tiangu, I borrowed power from the Culture King and let the Culture King possess me... I'm the Dao of Time Reversal!"

Doubao was never the Dao of Devouring; it was just Su Yu who thought it was.

Doubao continued, "My Dao is time reversal..."

Su Yu frowned, "Time cannot be reversed!"

Doubao was taken aback.

Cannot be reversed?

Su Yu said solemnly, "I saw it last time when you borrowed power from the Culture King. It's not that I didn't see it, but I know that time cannot be reversed! If Senior Doubao thinks time can be reversed, and you cultivate the Dao of Time Reversal... then it's only natural that you haven't become a Heavenly King, Heavenly Sovereign, or even a Master of Rules over the years!"

Because you've comprehended it wrong! Just like Old Turtle!

Old Turtle's Dao wasn't the Dao of Defense but the Dao of Strong Attack.

Doubao actually thought its Dao could really reverse time. If it had always been working on this, reaching the peak of the second-class Daofuse was already unexpected!

He had thought Doubao understood its own Great Dao rules, given that it had cultivated to this extent. But it seemed Doubao still thought its Dao was the Dao of Time Reversal.

Beside him, Wan Tiansheng also nodded slightly, "Time reversal is impossible! Time is unique! No being can return to the past! No living being can reverse time!"

He looked at Doubao, "Friend Doubao, do you think your Great Dao can reverse time and let people return to the past?"

Doubao muttered, "Yes, I can reverse time to a long time ago... and I've always been dreaming, not knowing the years in my dreams, as if I can return to the past..."

It knew it wasn't the Dao of Devouring; that was just a misconception by the outside world. But it thought it could reverse time. Was that also wrong?

At this moment, Su Yu noticed that Fat Ball and Consort Qi were gone. He didn't care too much, assuming they had left together. At this moment, he was more interested in Doubao's Great Dao.

Doubao was considered an old Daofuse, a very old one. During the Culture King's era, it had already achieved Daofuse, and until now, most of its contemporaries had become Heavenly Kings, Heavenly Sovereigns, or even Masters of Rules.

Logically, Doubao itself was the Great Dao. There was no reason for it to still be stuck at the second-class Daofuse realm.

Su Yu had previously said that Doubao and the others were the darlings of heaven. Yet, this darling seemed a bit disappointing!

Su Yu hesitated, "Back when you were with the Culture King, didn't the Culture King ever tell you what the essence of your Great Dao was?"

"Eat!"

Doubao said blankly, "Back then, I was just responsible for eating, nothing else!"

Eat?

Su Yu shook his head. That couldn't be the key. These old antiques always tend to forget some crucial information. Su Yu thought the Culture King couldn't have not said anything, but the Culture King, being a scholar, might not have explained it clearly.

The Culture King was that kind of person! He liked to make things mysterious, to appear cultured, like the pen dao, which he made incredibly complex. Whatever he did, he liked to make it seem ambiguous. Perhaps he wanted Doubao to comprehend it on its own. After all, at that time, they didn't lack Doubao as a Master of Rules. In the end, he left in a hurry and didn't leave anything behind.

"Time Reversal..."

Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate and looked at Doubao. The Heaven Gate could see the Great Dao and see it clearly, but for some Daos, if Su Yu didn't have a deep understanding, he could easily get confused and misled.

Doubao had cultivated for many years, thinking it was the Dao of Time Reversal. Was it really?

Time, in Su Yu's view, was mostly related to speed. For example, Little Zhou King's time acceleration! But reversing to the past wasn't a matter of speed.

Su Yu scrutinized the scene before him, noticing that Doubao's power of laws indeed manifested some faint images, as if it truly could reverse time.

Suddenly, Su Yu spoke up, "Senior Doubao, could you reverse time for me? Let me see the past!"

"Huh?" Doubao exclaimed in surprise, "You're too young! What if I accidentally reverse you to a time before you were born? You'd cease to exist!"

That made sense! Su Yu nodded, "Then reverse Senior Hongmeng."

Hongmeng, being an ancient relic, didn't mind. He chuckled, "Doubao, give it a try! Sometimes, when we're immersed in the essence of the Great Dao, we might not see through it clearly. I used to think my path was all about defense!"

As it turned out, his partner's path was not about defense but rather that of a combative female turtle.

Though Doubao was bewildered, he was willing to give it a shot. In an instant, the power of laws erupted.

Hongmeng neither defended nor resisted, allowing Doubao's power of laws to wash over him. Visibly, Hongmeng seemed to be traveling back in time, gradually appearing younger.

Su Yu watched intently. He observed that Hongmeng indeed seemed to grow younger. Of course, being slightly younger made no difference to Hongmeng, and his strength remained unchanged. However, after a while, Hongmeng's strength seemed to drop from the level of a Heavenly King to a second-tier Daofuse.

Doubao, panting heavily, declared, "See? I told you I could reverse time! Look, even Old Turtle's realm has fallen!"

He quickly retracted his power of laws, and after a moment, Hongmeng expelled the influence of the power of laws, returning to his peak state.

At this moment, Su Yu glanced at Wan Tiansheng, who also looked at Su Yu.

Suddenly, Su Yu took out the Starry Sky Seal, "Try reversing this!"

"What?"

"On the Starry Sky Seal!"

Doubao was troubled, "I only work on living beings, not inanimate objects! The Starry Sky Seal is a stone; how can I reverse it?"

Su Yu laughed, "Give it a try. Even stones have a past!"

Doubao, speechless, had no choice but to continue trying. Yet, the Starry Sky Seal remained completely unaffected.

Su Yu fell into deep thought. After a while, he spoke, "Try it on me, just a little bit of the power of laws."

"Alright!"

Doubao sent a small amount of the power of laws towards Su Yu. Su Yu endured the power, silently experiencing it. Moments later, his body shrank slightly, and his strength diminished, causing everyone to panic, fearing he might revert to a fetus!

Fortunately, Doubao quickly withdrew the power of laws.

Su Yu soon returned to his original form and strength.

Doubao muttered, "See? I told you I could reverse you to the past!"

Su Yu pondered quietly. After a while, he suddenly smiled, "Try again!"

"Again?"

"One more time!"

Alright then! Seeing Su Yu's insistence, Doubao didn't hold back and sent a similar amount of power of laws. This time, however, Su Yu remained motionless, unaffected, like a stone.

Doubao was taken aback and increased the influence of the power of laws.

Yet, Su Yu stayed unchanged!

After a while, Doubao, frustrated, intensified the output of the power of laws. Su Yu shouted, "Stop!"

Doubao, panting, asked, "How did you do that?"

Su Yu seemed unaffected, and it didn't look like he used any power of laws to resist. Besides, he currently didn't possess much power of laws.

Su Yu merely smiled!

"I understand a bit now!"

He looked at Wan Tiansheng. They had discussed this topic before.

Wan Tiansheng nodded slightly, "Willpower interference!"

Su Yu nodded as well, smiling, "Yes, it's willpower interference, or rather... an illusion!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded again, "Indeed, that's what I suspected! The path of time isn't about speed; it's likely an illusion! A kind of self-hypnosis..."

Seeing everyone's curious gaze, he explained, "Back then, when I discussed with Emperor Yu about traversing time, returning to the past, or a specific point, it was actually a method of willpower interference! For instance, Doubao previously borrowed power from the Culture King because the willpower was too strong, crossing some temporal barriers, leaving a strong willpower call at a certain point... giving the Culture King a sudden inspiration."

"It's a kind of foresight, leaving a force somewhere, which Doubao borrowed years later!"

"And now, Doubao's time reversal is actually a kind of illusion interference... a willpower disturbance, making you feel like you've been interfered with, reversed... with a strong hypnotic effect!"

Doubao was stunned. Over there, the light sphere Heavendoom understood and suddenly laughed, "So you're saying Doubao is actually just a hypnotist, not a time-reversing powerhouse?"

Doubao was utterly dejected. Could it be?

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "You're mostly right, but... a powerhouse is still a powerhouse. Hypnosis is also a strength! The strength lies not in hypnosis but in the direct effect on willpower, making your willpower believe it all!"

"So even when Doubao dealt with Hongmeng, Hongmeng felt like he returned to the past, his realm falling..."

Su Yu concluded, "In summary, I think it can be explained as an illusion! Creating illusions for the enemy, making them believe they've been reversed to the past. Doubao's power of laws has a strong guiding nature. When its power of laws touches me, I feel... I'm going back to the past, I'm being reversed, my realm is falling..."

As for the second time, Su Yu wasn't affected because his willpower was strong, and he firmly believed in himself, so he wasn't significantly influenced.

At this moment, Doubao dejectedly said, "So I'm just a hypnotist creating illusions?"

I am supposed to be a time-reversing powerhouse!

Su Yu laughed, "This path isn't weak! I actually think it's quite formidable! Every Great Dao is formidable! Whether it's time reversal or illusion hypnosis, I think there's not much difference in essence!"

He looked at Doubao, "Senior Doubao, you can think more about this! The essence of the Great Dao is actually the same! Is time reversal stronger than this path? Not necessarily!"

"…"

Doubao remained dejected.

Su Yu laughed again, "Senior Doubao, think more about it. I think this is more powerful than time reversal. My first divine character also has an illusion effect, which has been very helpful to me!"

"Moreover, yours isn't just a simple illusion; it also involves a kind of willpower hypnosis, which is an excellent combination!"

Su Yu laughed, "If you don't believe me, try changing your mindset. Instead of hypnotizing people to return to the past... think of Heavendoom as a dog. Use the power of laws on him, and even if he knows he's being hypnotized, he might still believe he's a dog..."

"Really?"

Doubao was surprised. Could it be?

The light sphere that was Heavendoom instantly fled!

However, he wasn't as fast as Doubao. In the blink of an eye, Doubao intercepted him, and Doubao's power of laws erupted, carrying a strong sense of command, "You're a dog, you're a dog!"

Heavendoom's light sphere struggled violently!

But it was useless.

After a while, within the light sphere, Heavendoom's shadow seemed to change shape, gradually transforming into a small dog similar to White Dog, with a somewhat bewildered look in its eyes.

Soon, Heavendoom shook his head, still appearing confused.

"Heavendoom, what race are you?" Su Yu asked.

Heavendoom turned his head, hesitated for a moment, struggled a bit, and quickly replied, "Dog race, why? Did Emperor Yu forget?"

"…"

Around them, a group of light spheres was shocked!

What the heck?

And Heavendoom, looking a bit uncomfortable, wagged his tail, still somewhat confused, quickly looked at Doubao, "Doubao, what did you just do to me?"

"…"

Doubao was also stunned, quickly withdrawing the power of laws.

And Heavendoom, gradually dispelling the influence of the power of laws, suddenly let out a miserable cry, "Damn, I'm not a dog, I'm not!"

Everyone was alarmed!

They all looked at Doubao, and Doubao, too, was filled with bewilderment. This was the first time he had tried something like this.

In his inherent impression, he was a powerhouse of the path of time reversal!

Why... wasn't it time reversal?

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng weren't surprised. They had long discussed that time reversal was more about willpower interference or a speed illusion.

At this moment, Su Yu laughed, "Senior Doubao, focus more on this aspect! Heavendoom is heavily injured now, not very strong, so interfering with him is easy, but interfering with a Heavenly King is difficult! If you interfere with a Sunmoon, and tell him he's your grandson, he might actually believe it!"

The main issue was that Doubao was too strong, but interfering with beings of the same level was challenging.

Su Yu's eyes gleamed, "Senior Doubao, this path is excellent!"

Doubao was a bit dejected, "Is it? It feels... useless!"

Su Yu laughed, these old folks had somewhat rigid thinking, "Senior Doubao, you're mistaken. In my view, if you develop your path to the extreme, it's incredibly powerful! For instance, in a great battle, you interfere with some weaker beings, weaker Daofuse, instilling a belief... you're all my avatars, or you're spies on my side, now it's time to turn the tide... it might cause Daofuse to rebel!"

Su Yu's eyes shone brightly, "This is actually a kind of control path, very powerful! Of course, among beings of the same level, it might not be top-tier, but against those weaker than you, I think it's a thousand times stronger than any physical path or warrior path!"

"If you reach the level of a Heavenly King, perhaps you could control everyone below that level! The Great Dao interfering with them, I think it's much stronger than the path of endurance! The path of endurance only makes them endure!"

"Senior, this path of yours can make them betray their original masters!" Su Yu's eyes grew brighter. "Doubao, you need to develop this further, think outside the box. Right now, you're only thinking about reversing them to the past... The past will weaken them, which isn't the best choice!"

"You could make them think about betrayal... Of course, this will cause intense resistance, but you could create an illusion. For instance, make Heavendoom believe he's a tree, one that can't move..."

Doubao quickly unleashed the power of laws on Heavendoom!

Heavendoom fled frantically, howling, "Don't experiment on me, try it on Grandstar instead!"

But in his heavily injured state, how could he escape Doubao?

In the next moment, Heavendoom's light form suddenly transformed into a tree, with a face resembling Heavendoom's, looking somewhat bewildered. "I am a tree, I cannot move!"

"......"

Everyone shivered!

Is this even possible?

Doubao was also stunned, but then his eyes lit up. In the next instant, Heavendoom turned into a fish, "I am a fish, everyone can eat me!"

Then, he transformed into a small furball, "I am from the Iron Devourer Race, I can devour the heavens and earth... Doubao is my master!"

"......"

Everyone looked at Doubao, who was having the time of his life, feeling a mix of joy and excitement.

This... is so much fun!

It feels way more entertaining than reversing time!

The intense mental interference made it impossible for someone like Heavendoom, who was weaker, to resist!

In the next moment, Doubao left Heavendoom, brimming with excitement, and suddenly looked at Old Turtle. A powerful wave of the power of laws swept over, and Old Turtle hurriedly dodged as Doubao shouted, "Let me try..."

"Scram!"

Even Old Turtle felt a chill, telling him to get lost.

What the hell are you trying to do?

"Old Turtle, let's play! I want to see if you can turn into a female turtle..."

"......"

To hell with you!

In the distance, Heavendoom regained his senses. Once the interference of the Great Dao was gone, he remembered everything. At this moment, he was filled with grief and indignation!

Bastard!

This is too much!

Doubao, one day I'll smash you... If I can't beat you, I'll go after your son!

Yes, I'll go after that little furball!

Meanwhile, Su Yu smiled as he watched Doubao, ignoring its game of chase with Old Turtle. He turned to Wan Tiansheng and said with a smile, "Principal, I think Doubao might soon reach the Heavenly King level!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, also smiling, "Doubao's understanding of the Great Dao isn't very deep, or rather, he doesn't understand the essence of the Great Dao much. Yet, through sheer brute force, he has reached the pinnacle of the Daofuse Realm over the years. Now, with a clear understanding of the essence of the Great Dao, even if it's not his own realization, he should soon reach the Heavenly King Realm!"

Beside them, the Fate Emperor sighed with genuine admiration, "This is talent, something one can't envy! Like me, I actually have a decent understanding of the Great Dao, but... talent is talent! Doubao, through a fundamentally flawed understanding of the Great Dao, managed to step into the pinnacle of the Daofuse Realm... This... this could even open a new path!"

There's nothing to say!

One truly can't envy this; it's pure talent and aptitude.

A spirit of the Great Dao!

On the other side, Flatbread looked eagerly at Su Yu. Su Yu chuckled, "Flatbread, I actually think it might really be the path of devouring! It's not wrong, because your path is quite simple. I have some understanding of the path of devouring, and I think your comprehension is correct!"

Doubao's path is somewhat complex.

Flatbread's path, however, isn't that complicated.

Yet Flatbread was extremely dejected, "So, I can't play around like the master?"

Doubao's path is so much fun!

It can turn people into dogs, trees, fish, it's really fun!

Su Yu laughed, "The path of devouring is also very powerful! September is also on the path of devouring, I think you two could discuss it more."

Having addressed these issues, Su Yu looked at the others, "Currently, it seems that everyone's recovery isn't much of a problem! Just give me some time to prepare, and... I might be preparing to open a path! Whether to dig a hole before or after opening the path depends on the situation with the Mark of Civilization..."

Su Yu smiled, "Whether before or after opening the path doesn't make much difference, but I'll try to dig the hole before opening the path!"

The Fate Emperor hesitated, "Emperor Yu, perhaps it's safer to open the path first."

Su Yu shook his head, "No, I'll dig the hole first. This way, everyone can strengthen their Great Dao, enhance their strength, and then restore their physical bodies! As for me opening the path... I will open it from within the chaos, transforming chaos into myriad paths. At that time, I will invite everyone to observe the path!"

Observe the path!

The Fate Emperor was shocked!

Su Yu... wants to let everyone observe the path?

Observe the path of a world creator?

Is Su Yu... considered a world creator?

At this moment, countless thoughts flashed through the Fate Emperor's mind, while others had varying degrees of understanding. Lantian also appeared quickly, with a serious expression, "Are you going to open the path alone, or within the River of Time?"

"Alone, within the chaos!"

Lantian frowned, "Where is there chaos now?"

Su Yu smiled, "Anywhere outside the realms is chaos! Beneath the Death Realm, above the Upper Realm, within Chaos Mountain, in the endless void... it's all chaos! Outside the River of Time, the Death Dao, and the Human Emperor's Dao, it's all chaos!"

"Chaos transforms into myriad paths, myriad paths transform into chaos... Everyone, if you can seize these two opportunities, and sort out your Great Dao, perhaps... you will gain something!"

Su Yu suddenly became somewhat arrogant, "I, Su Yu, may not be as great as the Master of Time, the Master of Death, or the Human Emperor, but in this era, I might be the only one willing to open the heavens myself!"

Open the heavens!

He wants to open the heavens, to create another day, like the Human Emperor!

Even if it's not as strong or as grand as the Human Emperor's, he still wants to try!

The Time Sage of the past seemed not to have chosen to open the heavens, instead maintaining a pseudo-path state. Su Yu wasn't clear about the Time Sage's thoughts, perhaps... he wanted to perfect the Book of Time before opening the heavens!

But Su Yu felt there was no need to wait too long!

The Time Sage had great ambitions, nurturing the path with the Book of Time, and then opening the heavens when it was strong, possibly achieving greater success.

However, Su Yu couldn't wait any longer!

He would open it first, even if the path he opened was weak, it would still be the path of opening the heavens!

How many world creators are there in this world?

The Master of Time, the Master of Death, the Human Emperor, currently just these three. Did the Culture King open the heavens?

It's hard to say!

The Culture King abandoned the pen dao, perhaps also choosing to open the heavens, but where did he open it?

This is unknown!

To what extent did he open it?

Su Yu also didn't know!

And the Human Ancestor, is the path of the physical body truly the Human Ancestor's only Great Dao?

This is also hard to say, perhaps the Human Ancestor had long abandoned the path of the physical body and chose to open the heavens elsewhere, which isn't impossible.

These people might all be world creators.

And observing the creation of the heavens, even if Su Yu's creation is weak, it's still the creation of the heavens, something that even the rulers of the past didn't have the chance to observe!

Yet now, Su Yu is willing to let people see!

What if they see it?

Su Yu smiled, "Everyone, prepare yourselves. Once I determine how many people will come on my side, there will be two opportunities. I hope none of you will miss them, and there's also the Human Emperor's map of the Great Dao, which might... count as a third opportunity! I hope some of you can seize this chance!"

Such an opportunity is too rare.

Su Yu's understanding of the Great Dao, the Human Emperor's understanding of the Great Dao, excavating the River of Time, sorting out the myriad paths...

All of this, in any era, might be the opportunity top-tier experts dream of.

At this moment, the Fate Emperor also trembled slightly.

Open the heavens!

Su Yu wants to open the heavens!

At this time, he chose to give up opening the path on the River of Time!

At this moment, the Fate Emperor sighed softly, "Emperor Yu... your ambition is boundless, Wuming is in awe!"

Su Yu, however, shook his head, "It's not ambition, just learning from predecessors! When I saw one peerless expert after another choosing to open their own path, choosing to create another day... I knew this is the true destination of the Great Dao!"

Su Yu chuckled, "The Master of Time opened this new world for us, and those who came after all aim to surpass their predecessors, not to remain stagnant! Of course, it might fail... even the Human Emperor interrupted his path of opening the heavens, this path is extremely difficult..."

Su Yu looked at him, "Do you know what it means to open the heavens?"

The Fate Emperor nodded, sighing, "I know! Back then, my clan's ancestors said that in this world, there are a few people we can never surpass! They have imprinted their legends in every corner of this world... you will never forget them! Even after millions of years, when you forget everyone else, when you reach a certain height, you will see them, look up to them!"

He spoke with some envy, some longing, "Those people, even if they died, even if they fell millions of years ago, the mediocre are not worthy of knowing, but legends can see legends!"

This was also Su Yu's thought at the time.

He thought of the Master of Death, even if he truly fell, truly died.

As long as future generations can see through the essence of the Great Dao, they should know how great and legendary the Master of Death was!

If future generations see the Human Emperor's Great Dao, they will understand how regrettable it is!

They will surely be as eager as I am to learn about these people's past, to understand their legends.

Why did the Human Emperor fail to open the path?

Now, Su Yu and the others still know, but countless years later, perhaps everyone will forget, but one day, someone will see that half-formed Great Dao and will be filled with curiosity.

Why did such a world creator choose to give up halfway?

What kind of legendary story is that?

They will surely be interested!

Just like Su Yu, he is extremely interested in the Master of Time, the Master of Death, even though they have never appeared, even though... they may have fallen millions of years ago!

This is the longing Su Yu and the others have for legends!

Throughout history, all sages are lonely, not because of the sages themselves, but because there are no sages after them, no one to understand, no one to know, you are not worthy to know them!

Those sages, clearly, would not care whether you ordinary people could understand them. Legends only care about legends!

Su Yu looked up at the sky, gazing at the Great Dao of Time. For a moment, he felt a surge of emotion. I want to forge my own path!

No matter how powerful the pen dao is, it's not the path I wish to take!

This era needs someone to witness the legends!
