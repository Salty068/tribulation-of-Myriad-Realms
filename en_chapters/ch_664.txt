Chapter 664: Life and Death Battle (Seeking Subscriptions)

At this moment, Venerable Turtle felt an even greater danger!

Venerable Turtle truly didn’t understand the dao well; he couldn’t even see through his own dao. The last time, he had to ask Su Yu to learn some details.

He was powerful, but his strength came from the accumulation of years.

Among the Grand Dream Turtle Race, a powerful individual had once pioneered a dao, and he was considered a Dao-fuser. However, that pioneer had died… Yes, they had died a long time ago. Venerable Turtle was the type of expert who had continuously cultivated this single dao, slowly ascending through the passage of time.

Thus, he exclusively possessed this dao.

Apart from him, no one else walked this path.

His strength lay in his longevity.

But at this moment, the opponent wasn’t using brute force against him, but rather deploying a grand formation woven from laws. Venerable Turtle hadn’t seen through it, but living for a long time had its benefits. Although he hadn’t perceived it, the sense of crisis was undeniably real!

The next moment, the ancient city vibrated!

A powerful aura surged forth, sweeping in all directions!

Venerable Turtle didn’t want to wait any longer!

Time for a test!

*Boom!*

Aftershocks reverberated, and immense power shook the surroundings!

However, when these forces touched the Heaven-Locking Grand Formation, they were confined within it and did not burst out!

Only then did Venerable Turtle see the barrier formations suspended all around him.

Venerable Turtle’s expression changed.

They were sealing him!

Few experts could seal him, and even fewer could prevent his power from overflowing. Venerable Turtle’s expression shifted, and he instantly revealed his true form—an enormous turtle!

At this moment, the ancient city also instantly transformed into armor covering his body, his shell already in place.

Not only that, but Venerable Turtle, having lived for so many years, knew how to respond when crisis struck. He wasn’t unprepared. In an instant, Venerable Turtle lay motionless deep on the seabed!

All his power was dedicated to defense!

Yes, defense!

He would wait, wait for rescue. He had already informed Su Yu. He couldn’t fight. If a major battle broke out and his true form died, or his dao body was destroyed, he would be finished, leading to collapse on both sides.

At this moment, Venerable Turtle felt the turmoil in the Death Realm.

This was a premeditated ambush!

The arrival of the West King was not an accident, but rather a prepared move.

He had been intercepted from both inside and out!

“Heh, how interesting!”

A charming laugh echoed as a black-robed expert appeared. The West King’s Consort wore a playful expression. This old turtle, she had to admit, was beyond her expectations.

He hadn’t fled!

He hadn’t fought!

Nor had he directly plunged into the Death Realm to merge with his dao body. Instead, his true form was entirely on the defensive.

Was he trying to block her?

Was he afraid that she would invade the Death Realm, attack from both inside and out, and kill them all without anyone knowing?

Indeed, if the old turtle burrowed into the Death Realm, she wouldn’t even need to seal him. She could directly kill her way through the passage, surrounding them from both sides. Not only would Venerable Turtle die, but Marquis Lanshan and the others wouldn’t survive either!

Two Heavenly King-tier experts—these people couldn’t stop them.

Now, if Venerable Turtle could hold his ground here, Marquis Lanshan and Venerable Turtle’s dao body, along with a few Daofuse experts, and the burst of the Human Lord Seal, fighting in the East King’s Domain, might not collapse so quickly!

Buy time!

This was Venerable Turtle’s immediate choice, even though he knew that merging with his dao body would give him a greater chance of survival. Venerable Turtle still chose to do this.

Because below, there was Hetu and his old brothers.

Marquis Lanshan and his dao body, even with the Human Lord Seal and the East King Seal, might not defeat the West King, but they wouldn’t be defeated so quickly either.

“How long can you hold out?”

A soft laugh, and the next moment, the dao manifested, countless chains fluttering in the wind. Not only that, but at this moment, a flame also rose, covering the sky and incinerating the void!

At the same time, a dao, like a towering mountain, suppressed the void above Venerable Turtle’s head.

Immovable as a mountain!

Venerable Turtle didn’t ask who the other party was, nor did he care. At this moment, layer after layer of defensive shields rose. He only defended, using all his power to defend against this top-tier expert!

*Boom!*

Flames surged, burning towards him. The dao flames instantly caused Venerable Turtle’s dao to tremble, and chains, one after another, sought to shackle Venerable Turtle’s dao.

The West King’s Consort frowned slightly.

She would have preferred this old turtle to fight her head-on. Now, with him playing the shrinking turtle, he was somewhat troublesome. Delay could lead to unforeseen changes. Although she had sealed this place, it would be troublesome if someone discovered it.

“Heaven-Locking!”

“Dao-Locking!”

“Void-Incinerating!”

The West King’s Consort let out a series of low shouts. In an instant, the Sea of Stars seemed to have been burned dry, the seabed cracked, and in the distance, an entrance to a minor realm actually appeared.

At that minor realm entrance, a Sunmoon Realm expert was about to enter the minor realm when he instantly turned to ash!

From within the minor realm, mad roars echoed, and a wisp of flame, following the passage, directly burned into the minor realm!

The West King’s Consort didn’t even glance at it!

However, for that minor realm, this was a fatal threat, even a threat of annihilation. An expert comparable to a Heavenly King, whose suppressive power even the minor realm couldn’t fully suppress. Even if it could, such a top-tier expert, even when suppressed, still possessed the destructive power of an ordinary Daofuse expert!

How could a minor realm, one without even an invincible expert, resist?

In the blink of an eye, countless mournful screams came from within that minor realm.

The spread of flames meant nothing short of utter disaster for the minor realm!

And Venerable Turtle’s defenses were quickly breached by one layer. Flames burned on his shell, and cracking sounds continuously rose. The dao above his head was also scorched by those flames and encircled by chains!

Venerable Turtle remained silent.

The enormous turtle lay quietly on the ground, allowing her to burn him.

The West King’s Consort stepped out of the void, one step at a time. At this moment, the seawater in the entire sealed area had been completely burned away. The West King’s Consort said coldly, “You’re seeking death. How long can you last? If you enter the Death Realm now, or your dao body returns and merges, you’ll still have a chance at survival!”

Venerable Turtle remained silent.

He couldn’t!

Both sides needed him. Without either side, it would lead to collapse.

The West King’s Consort chuckled faintly, “You have spirit! Let me kill you, Grand Dream. I will refine you into a turtle shell. I imagine its defensive power will surpass some divine weapons!”

“I also want to see which will last longer, the Death Realm or the Living Realm…”

The West King’s Consort smiled, but there was no joy in her eyes.

Annoying fellow!

This old turtle, silent and only defending, not even fighting back, made her very irritated!

Flames burned furiously!

“*Crack…*”

The sound of shattering echoed again. That formidable turtle shell, at this moment, couldn’t withstand the flames. Venerable Turtle grunted, and the dao above his head trembled violently!

That mountain-like dao struggled wildly, shaking, causing the chains to continuously break apart.

“Truly impressive!”

“Though a bit clumsy, your power is not weak!”

The West King’s Consort sneered. How long could he last?

Clumsy fellow!

Venerable Turtle remained silent; he had no spare strength to speak. This was not a merged dao body; he was merely relying on his formidable defensive power to block this madwoman.

He seemed to recognize the other party, a familiar presence.

“Su Yu… you must come quickly!”

Venerable Turtle thought silently. Beneath him, he was still protecting a tiny, insignificant female demon. Venerable Turtle’s blood continuously dripped. Beneath him, the female demon cried and screamed, not in human language, but in a unique demon language.

Venerable Turtle watched silently.

He hadn’t expected such a powerful existence to suddenly appear, turning all the joy of Heavendoom and the others achieving Daofuse into nothing.

He didn’t even have time to check on his dao body, but with the dao trembling, he knew his dao body was also fighting.

“I can’t hold out for too long… If my true form dies, my dao body will dissipate, and both the realms of life and death will collapse. Hetu, Heavendoom, and the others will all die, and Lanshan will also die…”

Never before had Venerable Turtle been so anxious, so uneasy.

Not even during the ancient era’s destruction!

Because back then, no one cared about them.

“Am I going to die?”

“I’ve lived long enough, but… Heavendoom and the others have only just seen hope…”

Venerable Turtle’s blood flowed continuously, his turtle shell cracking.

…

Death Realm.

Battle erupted!

Marquis Lanshan and Venerable Turtle’s dao body joined forces, one wielding the East King Seal, the other the Human Lord Seal, battling the West King. The earth shattered and the sky tore, but they were at a disadvantage.

Meanwhile, Heavendoom and a few others, along with three other human marquises, were fighting against more than a dozen death marquises.

On the periphery, Hetu roared, urging a large number of death monarchs to charge forward!

This was, after all, the East King’s Domain!

In the past few days, they had subdued quite a few death monarchs. These monarchs, individually, weren’t too strong, but working together, they managed to entangle three or four death marquises, putting up a decent fight!

However, Hetu knew that they were in big trouble!

The dao body was already fighting, but Venerable Turtle’s true form hadn’t arrived!

What a joke!

Without his true form, how could they contend with the West King?

Marquis Lanshan was not a King after all. Although her strength was considerable, having devoured the East King, compared to the West King, whose strength was even greater than before, Marquis Lanshan and Venerable Turtle’s dao body were steadily retreating!

The West King’s death dao covered the heavens and earth. He said coldly, “It seems you have no hope!”

No one spoke.

The group of death spirits had no interest in talking, and the living had no time to speak. The battle was incredibly fierce!

The entire East King’s Domain had turned into a battlefield!

In the distant reaches, an aura seemed to rise, yet on the other side, another powerful aura also surged.

The North Heavenly King’s voice reverberated, “South Heavenly King, just watch the battle! If humanity wants to unify the heavens and earth, and can’t even deal with the West King, how can they speak of unification? Such humanity is not worthy of your allegiance, South Heavenly King!”

“North Heavenly King, you will regret this. This tide… I have already felt it. Everything will be settled!”

The South Heavenly King’s clear voice echoed, “Everything will! I have already felt it, felt the fluctuations of the Celestial River of Death. It is welcoming death, welcoming newcomers with joy. Countless people will die! North Heavenly King, you will regret this!”

The North Heavenly King remained silent.

The Celestial River of Death was rejoicing?

Perhaps!

However, I don’t want to be a dog anymore. I simply want to be the overlord of this region. Why… must you force me?

The intense sounds of battle covered everything.

The Celestial River of Death was indeed trembling!

At the bottom of the Celestial River, a depth no one could probe, countless death spirits floated!

Some death spirits slightly opened their eyes, filled with confusion.

Some death spirits opened their eyes, and the world spun—that was the revival of peerless experts!

These death spirits all stirred, but they did not emerge from the Celestial River of Death, instead lurking, waiting, consolidating, and recovering!

Through countless ages, this Celestial River had drawn in far too many powerful individuals.

Since the Death Realm was opened, this Celestial River had almost always drawn in fallen experts, though many had simply not yet revived.

In a certain part of the Death Realm.

Inside a mansion.

Liu Hong peered outside, seeing the colossal figures battling in the distant region. He took a breath. It’s already this intense outside?

Are those Daofuse experts?

No, they’re stronger than Daofuse… Is this a Heavenly King-tier battle?

My heavens!

I only just ran in not long ago. Wasn’t it just Daofuse battles before?

How did the Death Realm become like this?

“Sorry, I don’t have the strength to participate. At least wait until I’m stronger…”

Liu Hong muttered, his Sunmoon Realm aura revealed.

Sunmoon Realm!

To others, it was considered powerful, but in this era, under these circumstances, it was worse than cannon fodder, too weak.

Liu Hong watched for a while, then stopped.

No point!

He needed to deal with what he needed to deal with first, otherwise, when the upcoming battle sweeping the Myriad Realms erupted, he wouldn’t even be able to make a ripple!

…

Outside.

The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King looked solemn, yet saw nothing. The Great Xia King said in a low voice, “Did battle really break out?”

Su Yu ignored him, instead looking at the distant River of Time!

He saw it!

He saw an incredibly vast dao, like a mountain peak, trembling. It was a very powerful dao, at least stronger than the blade dao Su Yu had seen. Was this Venerable Turtle’s dao?

Not weak!

But at this moment, chains coiled around this dao, and in the even more distant reaches, other daos seemed to be attacking it. Not only that, but towering flames also appeared!

Outsiders couldn’t see it!

Even the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King couldn’t see it. This showed that sometimes, dao battles were too secretive. Unless one was like Su Yu, ordinary people truly couldn’t discern anything.

Battle had erupted!

Not only had it erupted, but Venerable Turtle was also at a disadvantage.

Who could suppress Venerable Turtle in the Living Realm?

Tiangu and Marquis Jiantian were very strong, but they were still a bit weaker than Venerable Turtle.

Venerable Turtle’s strength was extremely formidable. Now, his dao was trembling, almost instantly suppressed. Unless a Lord of Laws made a move, or… Venerable Turtle was fighting with a clone!

“Something has also happened in the Death Realm; the Human Lord Seal is in turmoil!”

Su Yu already knew everything—a pincer attack from inside and out!

There must be two peerless experts besieging them.

Very strong!

Otherwise, Venerable Turtle’s dao body wasn’t present last time, yet he still managed to make two Daofuse experts unable to raise their heads.

“Perhaps… another Heavenly King-tier expert!”

He glanced at the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King. These two were not weak, but to say they could jointly take down a Heavenly King-tier expert was impossible.

Su Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “You two, quickly head to Grand Dream City to rescue Grand Dream! Remember one thing: if you can’t win, don’t fight to the death, don’t force it. Even if you can win, if you don’t have absolute certainty of killing them… keep a low profile, hide your strength!”

“Hide our strength?”

The two were stunned. Su Yu said solemnly, “Such experts, I know, are very difficult to kill! Once they are determined to run, they are also hard to keep! The Living Realm is not a dead end. You two entangle them, keep the commotion small. I’ll go find reinforcements!”

The two gasped. What kind of expert was it that Su Yu felt they, plus Venerable Turtle, weren’t enough, and he still needed to find reinforcements?

Su Yu said no more. At this moment, he had already led them into the Sea of Stars. He quickly turned around, “You two, hurry to the rescue. Spirit Suppressing General can’t hold on!”

“Understood!”

The two quickly flew towards Grand Dream City, which they remembered. The Great Qin King’s voice came, “Do we need to ask the guardians for help?”

“No, they are not qualified to participate!”

Yes, not qualified.

Moreover, too much commotion could easily attract the attention of other realms, drawing in Tiangu and the others.

Su Yu wasn’t afraid!

But he wasn’t ready. A second war breaking out now would lead to greater losses, which was not cost-effective!

On Su Yu’s side, many people were still improving, rapidly improving, such as June!

The West King’s Consort didn’t want to cause too much commotion, attracting human attention.

Su Yu… had the same thought.

Don’t make it too intense. This battle should ideally take place only among them, unknown to the myriad races.

The attacking expert was definitely not Tiangu or his group!

Those were dao chains!

Su Yu guessed, perhaps… it was related to the Control King!

“Flames, chains…”

Su Yu stopped thinking. He needed to continue secretly bringing people to participate in the battle.

With the Myriad Realms sealed by him, Su Yu would somewhat know if powerful individuals emerged. If the opponent wanted to assassinate Venerable Turtle, there might not be much commotion, and Tiangu and the others might not know.

Just like Su Yu, who wanted to assassinate the East Heavenly King, he didn’t tell his allies.

It could easily ruin things!

“Other guardians might have sensed it…”

The next moment, Su Yu quickly transmitted a message through various mayor tokens, “All guardians, continue to suppress the ancient cities, do not make any moves!”

A moment later, a message came back, “Boss is in danger!”

“Listen to my command! I have already sent people to rescue. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, having advanced to Daofuse, have already gone to participate in the battle. Do not ruin my important matter. I am the one who least wants anything to happen to Senior Grand Dream!”

With Su Yu’s words, some guardians who were eager to participate in the battle could only restrain themselves.

Yes, Su Yu was the one who least wanted anything to happen to the old turtle!

If something happened to Venerable Turtle, it could trigger a chain reaction!

Su Yu wasted no words, quickly stepped onto the River of Time, and rushed forward with all his might.

Too slow!

Still too slow. Even with his current astonishing speed, to Su Yu, it was still slow, so slow that every minute and second made him extremely anxious.

Damn it!

Indeed, even the best plans couldn’t withstand variables.

In the Myriad Realms, Marquis Jiantian still hadn’t appeared.

Damn it!

He absolutely must not let him sense the change in advance, otherwise, the trouble would be immense.

Even if they could win, Su Yu hoped for a stable victory, not another bloody battle, a narrow win at the cost of fallen Daofuse experts to kill other Daofuse experts. That wasn’t cost-effective; he still needed strength to fight his way to the heavens above!

And at this very moment, Su Yu seemed to sense something. The next moment, his voice shook the Myriad Realms, and he roared, “Great Zhou King, heed my command! Leave the Human Realm, intercept Marquis Jiantian, and seize the Heaven Hunting List!”

At this moment, Su Yu angrily shouted, “Audacious Marquis Jiantian, how dare you tamper with my compendium! Quickly slay him!”

In the boundless void.

Marquis Jiantian indeed felt a slight abnormality. He was just about to fly his Heaven Hunting Pavilion towards the Allheaven Battlefield to check the situation when he heard Su Yu’s angry roar!

Immediately after, he heard a heart-shaking sentence.

He had tampered with it!

Su Yu had discovered him!

At this very moment, phantoms appeared above some realms. They saw Su Yu suddenly raise a fragment above the Allheaven Battlefield and roar, “You scoundrel, how dare you be so audacious! Hand over the Heaven Hunting List yourself, or I will surely kill you! Great Zhou King, are you dead? Come out!”

The next moment, above the Human Realm, the Great Zhou King appeared, looking somewhat bewildered.

*Crap!*

What now?

Also, didn’t you say you’d use the fragment to secretly scheme against Marquis Jiantian?

How come… it seems like he didn’t know anything about it?

A scheme?

The Great Zhou King was also a smart man. He wasn’t entirely sure what Su Yu wanted to do, but Su Yu suddenly brought up a secret he had known all along, now using it as a target for his rage. He wasted no words, quickly broke through the void, and shouted, “Zhou Tianqi receives the order!”

With that, he swiftly charged towards the boundless void
