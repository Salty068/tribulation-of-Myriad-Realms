Chapter 767: Chain Reaction (Please Subscribe)

The beginning of the cosmos, initiated by the Dao of the Universe.

"Universe" signifies the four corners of heaven and earth, embodying the concept of space.

At this moment, Su Yu officially began to open his Dao.

A divine character flew out, the character for "Universe."

Suspended in the air, the divine character exuded a powerful aura. With a thunderous boom, the character exploded!

Yes, it exploded.

The entire chaos trembled once more, establishing the foundation of the Great Dao.

As the divine character exploded, a path appeared in the void—not just one, but many paths seemed to converge, forming the Dao of the Universe!

The Great Dao trembled, unstable.

Su Yu frowned.

A rootless duckweed!

"Opening the Dao in chaos, the Dao lacks a foundation, has no support, no starting point... The Dao connects with chaos, and chaos is insubstantial..."

A suppressive object was needed.

Su Yu had considered this before, but only by truly opening the Dao could he realize where the problems lay. No matter how much he imagined, it was just imagination. The first step of truly opening the Dao encountered difficulties.

"Suppress it with a mountain, suppress it with a seal..."

At this moment, Su Yu looked up at the Starry Sky Seal and the Human Lord Seal. He needed a seal to suppress the beginning of the Dao.

Which one was suitable?

The Starry Sky Seal was currently stronger than his Human Lord Seal, but the Starry Sky Seal was not his own.

For the suppression of the starting point of the Dao, it was best to use something of his own.

The Starry Sky Seal might be used later as the suppressive object at the endpoint of the Dao.

"Open!"

With a low shout, the Human Lord Seal instantly floated into the air, covering the sky and blocking out the sun!

On the massive seal, the thirty-six prefectures appeared, the Human Realm appeared, and soon, the domains of the Space and Iron Devourer Races appeared one after another.

The seal descended, seemingly breaking through the void.

In the blink of an eye, the seal transformed into a cornerstone, standing in the void.

Yet, Su Yu hesitated slightly.

Using the Human Lord Seal as the foundation was no joke. For any construction, the foundation was extremely important. The Human Lord Seal was based on the fortune of the Human Race and allied races. If the fortune was unstable or if the allied races betrayed, it would lead to an unstable foundation of the Great Dao.

Even if it could be remedied later, it would cause significant trouble, making the Great Dao turbulent.

Su Yu turned to look at the people behind him, their myriad emotions seemingly reflected in his heart—there was longing, expectation, and worry.

Su Yu was silent for a moment, his voice resonating through the chaos: "I use the Emperor Yu Seal as the foundation of the Great Dao, and with all races and fellow Daoists, I open this Dao together!"

Su Yu declared loudly, "Cultivating the Dao, if in the end, I am betrayed by all, then I deserve this calamity!"

With a hearty laugh, Su Yu suddenly burst into laughter: "The will of the people is the direction of the Dao! If all races betray me, if the Human Race betrays me, if fellow Daoists betray me... then it is my fault. Today, I shall lay the foundation of myriad Daos!"

Boom!

A thunderous roar echoed, and the massive Human Lord Seal instantly transformed into a pedestal. The Dao of the Universe suddenly had support, and in a blink, it connected with the Human Lord Seal!

The beginning of the Dao was established!

There were pros and cons, but in the path of opening the heavens, especially for Su Yu now, it was impossible to cover all bases. Achieving more benefits than drawbacks was enough.

With the foundation set, the chaotic power swept in all directions, impacting the foundation.

It seemed to be repelling!

Su Yu's act of opening the heavens seemed to provoke a counterattack from the chaos.

Opening the heavens meant breaking the chaos!

It was an invasion of chaotic space.

In the past, the masters of the Time Dao and the Death Dao, in their paths of opening the heavens, had all transformed chaos into domains. This was also a kind of Dao struggle, where personal Dao invaded the Dao of chaos.

Rumble!

In chaos, there was no time, no myriad Daos, no heaven and earth.

But at this moment, chaotic lightning suddenly flickered in the void, rapidly converging.

It was just a cornerstone!

Su Yu frowned immediately, damn it!

Opening the Dao even brought chaotic lightning?

Why wasn't this scene recorded in the Great Dao Diagram?

The Human Emperor was unreliable; the Great Dao Diagram didn't document this scene!

This was just the beginning.

Su Yu was speechless, extremely frustrated, but at this point, it was too late to think about these things. He glanced at the chaotic lightning brewing above, forget it, whatever.

Could it really strike me dead?

Just opening a Dao, why so serious?

The "Universe" character exploded, transforming into a Great Dao. A clear force of the Great Dao, like a galaxy, appeared in the chaos. At this moment, even outsiders could see it. The initial opening of the Great Dao, like the red line of Blue Sky that day, could be seen by all realms.

This was the first opening of the Great Dao, the power of the Great Dao manifesting in chaos, visible to all.

A Dao opened, beginning to spread.

Like a rainbow, it spread into the distance, with no limit, no endpoint.

However, the chaotic power around surged in, rumbling continuously, impacting Su Yu's Great Dao, seemingly trying to destroy it, not allowing the Great Dao to stand in chaos.

"Stabilize!"

With a shout, the Great Dao spread again, piercing through the chaos.

Su Yu shouted lowly, beginning to integrate the second Dao.

The Dao of the Universe was not yet complete.

The Universe, encompassing all things in space, life and death cycles, yin and yang, the five elements, a Dao containing myriad Daos, was currently just an empty shell.

The second Dao, the Dao of the Five Elements.

Starting with the Earth Dao!

Earth is the foundation of the five elements, Su Yu shouted lowly: "Those cultivating the Dao of the Five Elements, watch closely!"

He was about to integrate the second Dao.

As soon as he said this, someone muttered, not loudly, but many heard it.

"If this fails, won't it be embarrassing with everyone watching?"

"..."

At such a solemn moment, someone actually said this. For a moment, everyone's expressions were strange, all looking towards the source of the voice. Which bastard said this at such a time?

Heavendoom?

The voice didn't quite match, but besides Heavendoom, who else would say this now?

In the crowd, Heavendoom looked bewildered, noticing everyone looking at him. Fortunately, they soon shifted their gaze, but he was still furious, cursing silently.

Why!

Why look at me first for everything?

It definitely wasn't me who said it, which bastard said that?

He followed everyone's gaze, and upon seeing, Heavendoom grinned, speechless.

At this moment, everyone saw who spoke.

Marquis Dingjun!

Marquis Dingjun was sweating, I just said it casually, what's with these looks?

I didn't mean anything!

Stop looking!

He said nervously, "Observe the Dao, everyone observe the Dao, I didn't mean it, I'll shut up, shutting up now!"

Beside him, Marquis Tongtian smirked.

A loose tongue will get you in trouble sooner or later. Haven't you noticed I've been low-key, rarely speaking now?

Over there, Wan Tiansheng frowned, shouting lowly, "Alright, everyone observe the Dao, this is a rare opportunity. The process of opening the heavens, regardless of the outcome, is a process of the Great Dao from nothing to something, the birth of the Great Dao!"

Witnessing the birth of the Great Dao, especially now, everyone could see it clearly. This was the greatest gift!

One by one, what were they doing?

Meanwhile.

In the distance, a divine character flew out from Su Yu, merging into a page of the Mark of Civilization, the Earth character divine character. On that page, a Su Yu appeared, Earth Element Su Yu.

The aura wasn't too strong, but it had the power of the Sunmoon Realm.

Suddenly, the page flew out, instantly stretching into a path of the Earth Dao, one end connecting to the Human Lord Seal, the other extending into the endless void.

The Dao of the Universe was much stronger than the Dao of Earth, two lines appeared in the void.

And in the void, the chaotic lightning still hadn't descended, continuing to gather, more chaotic power accumulating.

The Dao had just opened.

Chaos was still determining whether it was truly opening the heavens or just a passage of Great Dao power.

This chaos also contained Dao rhymes.

The Earth Dao appeared, from nothing to something, everyone silently observed, comprehending. On that path, countless images seemed to appear, secret techniques of the Earth Dao, divine characters of the Earth Dao, racial abilities of the Earth Dao.

Everything related to Earth was extending.

"Earth gives birth to Metal, gathering Earth into mountains, where there are mountains, there are stones, stones can give birth to Metal..."

Su Yu's voice resonated again, "The Dao of the Universe must have the Five Elements! The Five Elements as the foundation, Earth gives birth to the Metal Dao!"

Boom!

Another page flew out, instantly transforming into a path.

"At this moment, it's just the initial opening of a virtual Dao, not yet at the fusion stage. I will first open the Five Elements, then integrate the Five Elements, merging them into the Dao of the Universe..."

As he opened the Dao, he explained his process to everyone, lest they didn't understand.

Everyone remained silent.

During the process of opening the Dao, allowing everyone to observe was one thing, but sharing the entire process was another. At this moment, Su Yu's magnanimity was unparalleled. Opening the Dao was a very secretive matter.

Yet now, Su Yu opened it up for everyone to see.

Perhaps they couldn't replicate it, but they remembered everything. Knowing how to open the Dao, future generations with great achievements could fully refer to it. This might be the first genius since the beginning of the heavens and earth to leave behind a complete process of opening the heavens.

...

Su Yu wasn't afraid of being seen.

Cultivating the Great Dao, complete imitation and reference were impossible. If one had their own understanding, looking at the process of predecessors opening the Dao might provide more insights.

There are no two identical Daos in the world. Even if later generations opened the same Dao, it wouldn't be the same Dao.

He continued to open the Dao of the Five Elements.

Pages flew out one by one!

The Dao of the Five Elements quickly gathered, and at this moment, six lines of Great Dao power spread in the void.

The next step was to integrate the Five Elements, then merge them into the Dao of the Universe.

However, just as Su Yu was about to merge the Earth and Metal Dao, panting slightly, suddenly, without a sound, a bolt of lightning struck, mixed with intense chaotic power, with no warning at all.

Chaos seemed to sense that this guy was truly opening the Dao, opening the heavens, not just passing by. Now, how could it be polite?

This was a Dao struggle!

Su Yu was invading the territory of chaos.

Rumble!

In his ears, countless thunderclaps sounded. The key was, this time it wasn't a one-time strike that stopped. All around, countless chaotic powers spread, transforming into lightning, madly striking Su Yu!

What punishment stops and starts? It doesn't exist!

Chaos just wants to kill you, why give you time to breathe?

Su Yu couldn't help but curse, "I just started opening the Dao, just started, not even perfected yet!"

Is it necessary?

He was battered and bruised by the chaotic forces, utterly helpless. 

What the heck? 

I just started opening my path, really, I'm just getting started. At least wait until I've perfected it before you start messing with me!

"You scoundrel, I'm about to take over your territory!" 

Su Yu was furious. This was something he hadn't considered before, and now it added a few more risks. 

Gritting his teeth, he quickly let out a chuckle. As a bolt of lightning struck, he suddenly punched it apart, extracting the Five Elemental power within to nourish his Five Elemental Great Dao. 

Headache! 

It wasn't Su Yu who was having a headache, but those watching from afar. Wan Tiansheng didn't want to disturb Su Yu's path-opening, but at this moment, he couldn't help but remind him, "Don't fight against the chaotic forces. Just focus on opening your path. They won't kill you in a short time!"

What are you doing? 

Acting like a child, fighting against the chaotic forces. 

Su Yu chuckled, "This is called doing the opposite. It strikes me, and I strike back, seizing its Five Elemental power. Later, when I need that power, I'll extract whatever force it has. It also helps me gain more insights!"

He extracted the Five Elemental power, which was much more violent than his own Great Dao power. However, there wasn't much of it. When integrated into the Five Elemental Great Dao, it was instantly suppressed and devoured. 

The Five Elemental Great Dao extended a bit further. 

Meanwhile, Su Yu, with his left hand, slashed at the lightning, while his right hand formed seals, continuing to merge the paths. 

He's really going for it! 

I, Su Yu, am not one to take a beating passively. If you hit me, I'll extract your power! 

With a loud boom, the Earth and Metal paths merged. The Five Elemental path, being a foundational Great Dao, was easily merged by Su Yu. Earth and Metal combined, and the sharpness and solidity merged seamlessly. 

It felt as if the two paths were originally one. 

After merging the two paths, Su Yu began merging the third path, the Water path. 

Metal gives birth to Water! 

As the three paths began to merge, the power of the lightning grew fiercer. Not only that, but there was also a faint tremor in the chaotic void, a powerful force of rejection, as if trying to expel Su Yu. 

"I refuse to leave!" 

Su Yu roared, determined to open his path here. 

...

The Great Zhou King sighed, glancing at Wan Tiansheng. The two exchanged a look, both feeling helpless. This guy was like a child. 

Although Su Yu was indeed young, at this moment, it was both amusing and exasperating. 

Fighting against chaos! 

However, encountering chaotic lightning while opening a path was unexpected. 

The Great Dao wasn't even perfected yet. 

Both of them felt a hint of worry in their hearts. 

Despite Su Yu's playful demeanor, this was actually a sign of increased danger, possibly more dangerous than previously anticipated. 

Wan Tiansheng transmitted his voice, "I believe he can handle the Five Elements and Yin-Yang Great Daos. My main concern is the Dao of Life and Death! Especially the Dao of Death. I'm worried he won't be able to merge it. If he can't merge it... the initial stage will fail. If the Yu Dao isn't perfected and the foundation isn't laid, he'll fail!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, transmitting his voice, "He'll probably leave the Dao of Death for the last step in merging the Yu Dao. He knows it's difficult to merge. Do you have any ideas?"

Wan Tiansheng was silent for a moment, then looked at Hetu in the distance, transmitting his voice to Hetu, "Friend Hetu, when Su Yu merges the Dao of Death later, during the intersection of life and death, I hope you can lend a hand!"

Hetu nodded slightly, not speaking. 

In truth, he was also a bit tense. 

The Dao of Death... does Su Yu really understand it? 

After all, he hasn't died before! 

...

Su Yu was naturally aware. 

At this moment, it was really just the beginning. 

The Great Dao continued to merge, and the lightning was just an appetizer. The Five Elemental path began to rapidly merge into one. 

In the distance, the Five Elemental Race watched with wide eyes, afraid to miss a single detail. 

Topsoil Spirit watched the most intently! 

The merging of the Five Elements was also his Great Dao. Su Yu was demonstrating the process of creating something from nothing, then merging it into one. This was precisely his path, how his Five Elemental Great Dao might have been born. 

Topsoil Spirit was itching to try it himself. 

However, he couldn't interfere with Su Yu's path-opening. 

In his urgency, Topsoil Spirit's own Five Elemental power manifested, and his Five Elemental Great Dao separated. Following Su Yu's method, he began to split his own Great Dao power. After splitting, he began to merge it again! 

Boom! 

A loud explosion echoed, and everyone looked at Topsoil Spirit, who was now covered in flames. Seeing Su Yu looking over from afar, he immediately put on an embarrassed expression. 

I didn't mean to! 

He really couldn't resist the urge to try it himself. His hands were itching! 

While merging the Five Elements, Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Come over, feel it up close. I allow you to merge your willpower a bit, to explore the Five Elemental path and experience it firsthand."

"No!" 

Wan Tiansheng shouted, "Nonsense! You're opening a path!" 

What are you pretending to be generous for! 

Wan Tiansheng was furious. You're opening a path right now. How can you let others interfere? 

Not to mention interference, if Topsoil Spirit harbors ill intentions and suddenly disrupts the Five Elemental path, your path-opening will fail directly. Are you gambling your future? 

Su Yu laughed loudly, "It's fine. I also want to learn from the Five Elemental Race's method of merging the Five Elements. Cultivation is about exploring together. I'm not a god! I'm not proficient in everything, not in every Great Dao. Specialization is key. Can I compare to the Five Elemental Race, who have been cultivating the Five Elements for hundreds of thousands of years, in terms of specialization?"

"Topsoil Spirit, come over, bring a few of your clan's ancestors!" 

Su Yu laughed loudly, "Let's learn from each other. Merge the path beside me..." 

Topsoil Spirit's expression changed several times. Gritting his teeth, he transmitted his voice to a few ancestors, quickly flying into the chaotic void. 

Wan Tiansheng looked helpless! 

This guy, Su Yu... is this move good or bad? 

When Topsoil Spirit and the others arrived, Su Yu quickly said, "Help me block some of the lightning power. Try to extract the Five Elemental power to perfect my Five Elemental path. You can also appreciate the wonder of merging the Five Elements..."

The few of them didn't say much. Su Yu had opened a path before, and they had tried to repair and extract it, so they weren't inexperienced. 

Soon, six powerful beings began to block the lightning power. 

In this place, there weren't many rules. 

There was no saying that more people would make the lightning stronger. 

It was all the same! 

Their willpower also began to merge into Su Yu's Five Elemental path, carefully experiencing Su Yu's Five Elemental Great Dao. At this moment, the five paths were merging into one, with a tendency to become a single path. 

Topsoil Spirit felt it most clearly, his eyes showing joy. 

He also began to attempt the merging of the Five Elements. At this moment, there were no signs of an explosion. 

He sensed it and knew Su Yu was trying. Since it was Su Yu's first time, he didn't dare to move recklessly, lest the Great Dao explode. Seeing this, Topsoil Spirit immediately said, "Emperor Yu, I'm skilled in the Five Elements. Let me try first. You guide me on how to completely merge them, and I'll set an example for you!"

"..." 

Su Yu chuckled. 

It's not impossible. If Topsoil Spirit can completely merge the Five Elements, it means I can too. He didn't say much, a stream of willpower surged into Topsoil Spirit's mind. 

Mutual benefit. 

I let you observe my path-opening. If you're willing to help me, I don't mind. 

Topsoil Spirit received the message and quickly began to attempt it. 

Boom! 

A loud explosion, water and fire clashed on his body, and his Great Dao exploded, spewing a mouthful of blood. 

Su Yu was slightly shocked! 

Failed? 

Topsoil Spirit wasn't too discouraged, his eyes bright, quickly saying, "Emperor Yu, it's not the merging steps that are the problem. It's that when the Five Elemental path closes, the Water and Fire paths are too close. They need to be separated!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. These were minor details. He wouldn't pay attention to such small details. 

If his Water and Fire paths were too close, it wouldn't directly fail, but the Great Dao would tremble, and he'd have to suppress it with effort. 

Topsoil Spirit began to attempt again. 

Moments later, his aura changed. It wasn't that his realm improved, but his Great Dao power changed. Suddenly, a force of the Five Elements merged into one, and he punched out, turning the surrounding chaotic void into a cage! 

Five Elemental Prison! 

"It's possible!" 

Topsoil Spirit's eyes shone even brighter. His realm was still the same, roughly at the fourth tier, close to the third tier of Daofuse. But after completely merging the Five Elemental power, he vaguely felt he could fight against the second tier of Daofuse! 

A step to heaven! 

Three days ago, he had just entered the Daofuse Realm. 

Su Yu pondered for a moment, and soon, he also quickly merged the Five Elements, avoiding the intersection of Water and Fire. 

Boom! 

A colorful Great Dao power instantly manifested, the five paths completely merged into one. Su Yu's eyes lit up, it went smoothly! 

The foundation was laid! 

As soon as the Five Elemental path merged, the Yu Dao approached, actively wanting to merge with the Five Elements. 

As the two Great Daos touched, suddenly, illusory images appeared around them. 

It seemed like a chaotic world was forming! 

The heavens and earth were being created, with the Five Elemental power emerging, and a new world began to give birth to the Five Elements! 

Su Yu quickly suppressed it, and around him, chaotic forces surged, rejecting his creation of the heavens here. 

Not allowed! 

Su Yu ignored it, the Five Elemental Great Dao began to forcibly merge, the beginning of the heavens. 

Boom! 

Thunder roared. 

In the distance, the Tea Plant suddenly exclaimed, "Ancient beasts are coming, really, should we fight?" 

In that direction, Lantian instantly appeared, looking into the distance. At this moment, in the chaotic void, ancient beasts indeed appeared. 

Lantian's expression changed slightly. This should be the nearest ancient beast sensing the commotion and arriving first. 

The commotion was expanding. 

His expression turned cold, and the next moment, he shouted, "Kill!" 

They must quickly kill the ancient beasts while there are few of them, otherwise, once more gather, it will be a big problem. 

Lantian charged forward, shouting, "Kill quickly, no prolonged battles!" 

Prolonged battles were not allowed! 

If the battle dragged on too long, it would be a big problem, possibly attracting more ancient beasts!

The Tea Plant wasted no words, reverting to its original form as countless roots spread out. Both it and Lantian possessed the power of chaos, making them unopposed in this battle.

Boom!

The battle erupted instantly. Lantian unleashed his full strength, and in the blink of an eye, he struck with all his might, shattering the head of an ancient beast with a single punch. This was a top-tier ancient beast with physical strength comparable to the third-tier Daofuse Realm. Yet, it was slain on the spot by Lantian's swift and decisive attack.

He quickly tossed the corpse into the Land of the Abyss and shouted, "Great Ming King, craft some formation talismans. We might need reinforcements!"

The previous talismans, except for those of Su Yu and Fat Ball, had been lost in explosions. They needed to be remade now.

The Great Ming King received the corpse and, not daring to delay, quickly commanded, "Help me disassemble the body. I need a few people to assist..."

A group of people swiftly got to work.

Meanwhile, Lantian's expression shifted again. In the void, three enormous ancient beasts suddenly appeared, exuding a fierce aura as they flew from the depths of chaos. Indeed, there were ancient beasts in this place!

One of the ancient beasts even possessed intelligence, using its willpower to convey its thoughts.

"Retreat!"

"This is chaos, not the Myriad Realms. Chaos belongs to us!"

Lantian couldn't be bothered with words. Several figures charged forward, and the Hunting Heaven List emerged, covering the sky. He couldn't allow these ancient beasts to gather, or who knew how many might come? If too many arrived, it would be a major problem later on!

...

Su Yu's expression also changed. There really were ancient beasts. The most troublesome situation had begun!

At this moment, the Five Elemental Paths and the Domain Path had merged, and Su Yu's aura was changing. He accelerated, rapidly opening the Path of Yin and Yang!

The pages of a book appeared!

Seeing this, Topsoil Spirit and the others quickly withdrew to avoid interfering with Su Yu's opening of the Yin and Yang Paths.

Two paths were being opened almost simultaneously by Su Yu.

Yin and Yang intertwined, one bright, one dark!

"Stabilize Yin and Yang!"

Yin energy descended, and Yang energy ascended. At this moment, the place where Su Yu was opening the path transformed into a void, with chaotic energy surging in, vying for control with Su Yu.

Boom!

The sound of paths colliding echoed, paths intersected, and forces clashed. Su Yu staggered back a few steps, blood trickling from his mouth, his brows slightly furrowed.

Opening a path in chaos seemed a bit more challenging than anticipated.

"Open the heavens and earth!"

With a furious shout, divine characters appeared, instantly merging into the two pages of the book. At this moment, two more paths manifested.

...

"He's accelerating!"

The Great Zhou King frowned. "The pressure seems greater than expected. Opening so many paths at once leaves him no room for error or adjustment. What can be done?"

It's impossible not to make mistakes!

If Su Yu succeeded in one go without needing adjustments, that would be the real anomaly.

Wan Tiansheng said nothing, turning to Fat Ball and quickly asking, "Fat Ball, you still have one of the formation talismans from last time, right?"

"Yes."

"Give it to me."

Fat Ball blinked, "Are you going to kill ancient beasts?"

"Yes."

"I'll go!"

Fat Ball wagged its tail, "I'll go kill them! I'm a bit stronger than you..."

Wan Tiansheng chuckled and nodded, "Then I'll trouble you, senior. Don't let the ancient beasts intrude into his path-opening area, or it will be a big problem!"

"Understood!"

Fat Ball instantly flew out, a shoe in its mouth, and from a distance, it threw a boot. Boom!

A boot stomped down!

An enormous beast was stomped to death on the spot!

...

At the same time Su Yu was opening his path.

In the Upper Realm, in the land of chaos.

The Gate of Hell.

Suddenly, the Gate of Hell trembled, and the next moment, pairs of eyes appeared behind the gate.

"It seems... something has happened!"

"We are sealed within the gate... unable to go out... let the ancient beasts of Chaos Mountain investigate..."

The next moment, a wave of power spread out.

Above the Gate of Hell, in the grand hall, the ancestor in Yuehao's mouth was speaking when his expression suddenly changed. He frowned slightly and said, "What's happening with the Gate of Hell?"

A special wave spread out.

The ancestor intercepted a segment, frowning slightly, "A mutation in chaos?"

What mutation?

He quickly scanned the surroundings, even the depths, but detected no anomalies.

Where was the mutation?

But at this moment, suddenly, countless giant beasts in Chaos Mountain roared, and then dozens of ancient beasts, led by a Heavenly Sovereign-level giant bird, flew madly towards the deepest part of chaos!

That place, even the ancestor wouldn't easily venture into, as it was too easy to get lost.

Chaos had no direction, no limits, no heaven or earth, making it too easy to become completely lost and unable to return.

The ancestor frowned, initially not paying much attention.

But the next moment, his expression changed, "Not good!"

Yuehao and the others all looked at him!

The ancestor's expression changed slightly, "Damn it, the chaos beasts have left... our obstacles..."

As soon as he said this, the others' expressions also changed.

And at this moment, a wild laugh echoed, "The ancient beasts have left, Myriad Races experts, why not take this opportunity to destroy the Control King's lair!"

The chaotic ancient beasts had caused the Myriad Races quite a bit of trouble.

Now, suddenly, a large group had run off. What was this if not trouble?

The ancestor's expression changed slightly, quickly breaking through the air and shouting, "Bold scoundrel, Yuehao, you all, kill this scoundrel!"

And he quickly flew towards the chaotic forest.

To stop the Myriad Races experts!

The chaos beasts had suddenly run off, and the Myriad Races might be tempted, as the opportunity was rare.

As for where the chaos beasts had gone... who knew!

...

At this moment.

Soul Burying Mountain.

Hundred Battle suddenly turned back, frowning slightly, "Has something happened? The chaos beasts suddenly flew deeper... is there a change in the depths of chaos?"

The depths of chaos were mysterious to everyone.

Now, a large number of chaos beasts had suddenly run off. What was going on?

Was the great battle in the Upper Realm about to break out early?

Previously, it was just small skirmishes, a giant axe, not enough to trigger an instant battle between the two sides, but now, the Myriad Races might not miss this opportunity.

Sure enough!

As Hundred Battle pondered, a giant bamboo of Tongtian suddenly struck towards the depths of Chaos Mountain.

March's voice shook the heavens, "The ancient beasts are gone, our chance has come, kill them!"

Boom!

In the void, a giant fist floated, shattering the giant bamboo with a punch. March, however, laughed loudly, "The old guys have appeared, it seems the ancient beasts really ran off!"

"Who are you? What is your relation to the Control King?"

"If you are the Control King's descendant... you're dead!"

March's body expanded a million times, exuding a fierce aura, "Your lineage must die! My father died at the hands of the Control King. If you are the Control King's son, even if you can fight the master of rules, I'll still kill you!"

Boom!

March wielded a giant bamboo, crazily attacking the opponent. Soon, Destiny, Moon Heavenly Venerable, and others appeared one after another.

This time, the advance was exceptionally smooth.

Because the ancient beasts were gone!

Without the ancient beasts to block them, these Heavenly Sovereigns moved at incredible speed.

And the ancestor of the Control King's lineage also frowned slightly.

This was truly... an unexpected surprise!

Damn it!

Why did the ancient beasts run off?

He was also speechless. This completely shattered his previous impression of the ancient beasts. These ancient beasts rarely ventured into the depths of chaos anymore. Why did they suddenly all run off today?

"There's a mutation in the depths of chaos... what mutation?"

The ancestor didn't dare think too much. At this moment, the most troublesome thing was that the Myriad Races might take the opportunity to attack.

"Yue Luo, Yuehao, Yue Ming..."

The next moment, several Heavenly Sovereign-level experts flew in from afar, beginning to engage these formidable enemies, while further away, the giant axe wielded by the Giant Axe Marquis fled madly.

Once Yuehao left, he returned to kill again, forcing Yuehao to stop, gritting his teeth, and once again charging towards the Giant Axe Marquis!

This guy had been causing trouble lately!

"Giant Axe, you and I have no enmity..."

"Screw you!"

The Giant Axe Marquis roared, "March said I owe that Su Yu a life. In that case... killing you, the culprit, will settle my debt. Lie down and let me kill you, and I'll leave immediately!"

"No, there's also that... your niece, last time only you two survived... killing you two will avenge them. Anyway, Su Yu isn't dead, Yuehao, let me kill you and be done with it. If you two don't die, I won't rest!"

"..."

Yuehao was furious beyond measure, "Then you go die!"

This Giant Axe, impossible to reason with!

Completely unable to communicate!

The Giant Axe only recognized one thing: he owed Su Yu a life. Of course, repaying with his life was pointless.

Didn't Su Yu suffer heavy losses before?

He himself wasn't dead!

Among the group he attacked that day, only Yuehao and that Yuxi survived. Killing these two would settle his debt.

If these two didn't die, he'd still owe a debt!

"Kill!"

The Giant Axe Marquis's massive axe swept across the heavens, roaring, "Myriad Races bastards, fight! Go all out, these Control King's bastards without the ancient beast barrier might not be able to handle you!"

"Do you have to wait for the ancient beasts to return before you act?"

"Isn't that stupid?"

The Giant Axe Marquis roared wildly, and as he roared, he shouted again, "Hundred Battle, where the hell are you? Why is that bitch Yue Luo back! You didn't get suppressed again, did you? Damn it, did you fall for a beauty trap again?"

"Hundred Battle!"

The Giant Axe Marquis shouted, "That bitch Yue Luo, so ugly, no ass, clearly not good stuff, did you fall for her again? Where's your brain? Pig brain?"

He thought Yue Luo was ugly!

That waist twisting, not afraid of breaking.

That ass, not big enough!

That face, not smooth enough, lacking everything, how could Hundred Battle fall for her?

Really couldn't understand!

...

Further away.

Yue Luo, who had been laughing coquettishly and preparing to face other opponents, suddenly froze, turned, and charged towards the Giant Axe Marquis!

Some things... really couldn't be tolerated!

...

And the Giant Axe Marquis, sensing that aura, laughed wildly, "I lured Yue Luo and Yuehao over, kill them! Myriad Races bastards, put in some effort!"

"I'm running first... Yue Luo, you ugly woman, you can only seduce that Hundred Battle guy, never seen the world, I've seen a bunch of Martial King's wives, all with big asses, good for breeding... not something you can compare to, Martial King's taste is excellent!"

Marquis Giant Axe, while making his escape, couldn't help but praise, "The Martial King's taste is truly impeccable!"

As for Hundred Battle... well, that's just bizarre!

We warriors, of course, can't marry such a delicate and unattractive wife. No taste at all!

Hundred Battle's taste doesn't align with a warrior's aesthetic in the slightest!
