Chapter 778: Truly Pitiful (Seeking Subscription)

Death Realm.

For several days, Su Yu had been engrossed in the study of resurrection.

Inside the research lab, Su Yu appeared somewhat fatigued. After a long while, he finally spoke, "It's almost there. Just one more practical test. Continuing to research without action is pointless. Let's use Hetu as a test subject!"

"......"

Hetu silently watched Su Yu, feeling increasingly pitiful. Use me as a test subject? Is that something a person would say? You're not giving me any confidence at all. I'm really scared here.

Su Yu glanced at Hetu and smiled, "Too much hope, and if it fails, wouldn't that be even more despairing? Having less hope now is actually a good thing because... I'm not entirely sure if I can succeed."

Hetu raised an eyebrow slightly, then quickly smiled, "It's alright. If it truly fails, it's not a big deal. As a death spirit, would I still fear death?"

"I would!" Su Yu nodded. Hetu was left speechless, unable to continue the conversation. Fine, just pretend I didn't say anything.

"Let's go!" Su Yu said no more, looking at Hetu and Liu Hong, "Let's head to the edge of chaos. It's unlikely we can resurrect in the River of Time. If not, we'll have to resurrect in my small world!"

Hetu didn't mind, smiling, "If I truly resurrect in Your Majesty's world, that's a good thing. It means I've naturally become part of the Great Dao, without having to compete with others!"

Su Yu also smiled, saying nothing further as he quickly walked out. Li Yun and several other death spirits followed, all carrying a sense of anticipation and longing.

Resurrection! The revival of the dead. This might be the first time since the beginning of time. Whether it's possible or not, no one knows for sure.

...

Today, the strong gathered once more at the edge of chaos.

Recently, Su Yu and his group frequently visited this place, scaring the North King and others so much that they dared not approach. Even the powerful beings at the sealed land were increasingly fearful.

Because the power on Su Yu's side seemed to be continuously increasing. Every time a strong individual flew over, they felt stronger than the last time—growing stronger and stronger!

On this day, Su Yu led his group over once more.

The previously silent Death Spirit Emperor suddenly spoke from the sealed land, his voice low, "Su Human Lord, I heard... you seem... to be preparing... to resurrect death spirits?"

Boom!

Other beams of light flickered in response.

Su Yu was also surprised. Looking down, he smiled, "Where did you hear that?"

The Death Spirit Emperor replied softly, "Your people often pass by, and I overheard bits and pieces."

Su Yu laughed, "Loose lips!"

"So, it's true?" The Death Spirit Emperor didn't show his face this time but instead manifested a dark silhouette, uncertain and speaking softly, "Does the Human Lord know that life and death are the hardest to overcome? Resurrection... is just a legend!"

Su Yu looked down at him, smiling, "Just trying. Does the Emperor also wish to be resurrected?"

The Death Spirit Emperor replied softly, "Who wouldn't want to be resurrected? No one willingly remains a death spirit forever! It's just that, having died once, as former failures, death is our destiny! Which death spirit doesn't have regrets? Everyone wants to make up for the regrets of their past life."

His voice wasn't domineering, arrogant, or overbearing. From the first day, he had always spoken softly.

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Was the Emperor a scholar in his past life?"

"I read a few books, but they were all about the Great Dao, quite different from today's scholars."

The Death Spirit Emperor said, quickly returning to the topic, "Does the Human Lord need any help from us for the resurrection of death spirits?"

Su Yu was slightly taken aback.

"What does the Emperor mean?"

"We... want to see a glimmer of hope, a bit of expectation, even if... we may not have the chance ourselves!"

The Death Spirit Emperor spoke softly, "For countless ages, the Human Emperor, Culture King, and other peerless geniuses—did they not think of resurrection? Yet, they all failed! Each failure is a blow to death spirits! We long to see the hope of resurrection! Even if it's our enemies being resurrected!"

He sighed, "Even if it's an enemy! As long as resurrection is possible, it means we still have hope! It also means that being a death spirit isn't our final destiny! I think, among the truly wise death spirits, none would obstruct the Human Lord's resurrection efforts, and might even be willing to offer some help!"

Su Yu was somewhat surprised.

Upon reflection, he realized this was indeed the mindset of a truly wise individual.

Yes, in attempting resurrection, these truly wise death spirits actually hoped Su Yu would succeed. Whether he was an enemy or not, at least it would give everyone hope!

Those obstructing Su Yu's resurrection were likely not very wise.

Of course, Su Yu wasn't afraid of death spirits obstructing him!

He looked at the projection of the Death Spirit Emperor and smiled, "The Emperor is quite insightful. If the Emperor truly wishes to help, it's not impossible. For instance, when I strip the imprint of the Death Spirit Great Dao, it might cause a Dao riot. Perhaps the Emperor could help suppress it?"

The Death Spirit Emperor fell into contemplation. After a moment, he nodded slightly, "That might happen, but suppression... I fear I may not be able to do it! I suspect that during resurrection, the riot of the Death Spirit Great Dao might not be very useful... The Human Lord should be cautious of the death spirits themselves!"

Su Yu frowned slightly.

The Death Spirit Emperor spoke softly, "I think the Human Lord shouldn't bring too many death spirits along! If something goes wrong, there might be a situation where the Great Dao drives the death spirits to deal with the Human Lord! Whether we're sealed or not, or whether it's the South King or the North King, we might all become pawns of the Great Dao, the blade of the Death Spirit Great Dao!"

Su Yu pondered.

The possibility was not small!

This was something he had somewhat overlooked. This time, many death spirits had come to observe.

Including top-tier beings like the South King and Marquis Lanshan. If they all turned against him midway, it would be very troublesome.

His own people couldn't be killed, and suppressing them would also be a hassle.

Moreover, if at the critical moment, a death spirit self-destructed, it would be even more troublesome. If an enemy self-destructed, it would be over, but if Lanshan and the others self-destructed, what then?

"Thank you for the reminder, Emperor!"

Su Yu smiled, "The Emperor seems to be a wise person, much better than Dizhi Luo. As always, if the Emperor wishes to join, kill Dizhi Luo as a token of allegiance, and I might consider it!"

"......"

Below, Dizhi Luo's face suddenly appeared, filled with anger, wanting to roar.

But he quickly suppressed it.

Because there was a dog that could step on him!

At this moment, he saw a dog flying over from afar. Dizhi Luo suppressed the anger in his heart and said nothing.

Soon, Fat Ball flew over, curiously asking, "Did they stop you? Should we beat them up?"

It had already taken out its boots!

Su Yu suddenly stopped here, and it thought there was going to be a fight.

Although it didn't really want to fight, Su Yu was going to find its master. If these people dared to oppose Su Yu, it meant they were bullying Fat Ball, and it had to settle accounts with them.

Su Yu chuckled, "It's fine. The Emperor is reasonable, but every leader has some subordinates who are unruly, reckless. In a hostile situation, they're quite useful!"

That's also the truth.

For instance, among his own subordinates, there were quite a few reckless individuals.

For example, the phrase "kill Hundred Battle" was often heard.

Of course, Hundred Battle's subordinates also had such people.

In fact, they were necessary. Some were genuinely reckless, some pretended to be reckless, and some understood the emperor's heart and deliberately flattered.

Even if the emperor didn't necessarily adopt their suggestions, it was nice to hear.

Su Yu might not have the heart to kill Hundred Battle, at least not now, as he didn't advocate internal strife. But hearing some people say "kill Hundred Battle" would make him feel good.

So, Hundred Battle's subordinates probably had such people too.

The Death Spirit Emperor said nothing more, nor did he mention Dizhi Luo again. He softly said, "Then I wish Su Human Lord success!"

"Thank you!"

Su Yu smiled and walked away.

Fat Ball followed behind, wagging its tail, holding a boot in its mouth, eyes curious, "Why did he suddenly start talking to you? Is this what they call a smile hiding a dagger?"

"Oh, you've learned the phrase 'a smile hiding a dagger'?"

Su Yu laughed. Fat Ball was frustrated, "I'm a scholarly dog!"

Last time, that Eight-Winged Tiger called itself a scholarly tiger. Fat Ball thought about it and realized it was a scholarly dog too.

It had read many books!

Now that it thought about it, being a scholarly dog sounded nice. Previously, when it fought with the Eight-Winged Tiger, it didn't win, and it still held a grudge.

Su Yu laughed again.

As they walked, he asked, "How's your Devouring Dao coming along?"

"I can eat anything, bite anything, but it still feels like something's missing..."

Fat Ball was frustrated, "I always feel like something's lacking. Do you think it's because I'm too dumb?"

"Hard to say."

Su Yu smiled, "It might still be related to your Dao. The Eight-Winged Tiger said you're a Sun Devouring Divine Dog, but you've reformed, becoming a member of the myriad races from the ancient chaotic race. The Dao is connected to the River of Time! During this time, the Time Sage and Culture King specifically taught you to open a path. I think it might not be your original path!"

"The Time Sage and Culture King probably both have Heaven Gates and are well-informed. Since they taught you to open a path and named it the Biting Dao... I think there might be some differences from the Devouring Dao!"

He thought carefully, realizing he shouldn't be too arbitrary. Fat Ball wasn't a rogue cultivator; it truly had masters, and they were two supreme masters.

So its path, named the Biting Dao, might indeed have some differences from the Devouring Dao.

Su Yu continued, "Biting and devouring seem similar, but there might be some essential differences! Devouring... implies swallowing whole, finishing in one bite! But biting... does it mean biting without eating?"

Fat Ball was a bit confused. It was indeed a scholarly dog, but when it came to gardening, it was particularly skilled. However... apart from gardening, it wasn't very proficient in other things.

It was curious, "Biting without eating, what does that mean?"

Liu Hong coughed lightly from the side, chuckling as he said, "Well... how should I put it? It's like biting you, but finding you too filthy to eat. The essence of devouring is to consume, to swallow, to encompass. Biting, on the other hand, is about ferocity, madness, and not stopping until the enemy is dead. As they say, a dog that bites doesn't bark..."

Fat Ball looked at Liu Hong, who gave a dry laugh. "I'm half a student of the Culture King, and Fat Ball, you're practically family! So, I'm just sharing my insights on the difference between biting and devouring."

Fat Ball nodded slightly, still looking confused, and turned to Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled, "Actually, Liu Hong's words are quite clear. Biting is about madness, not stopping until the end! Simply put, Fat Ball, you're a bit... too peaceful?"

"Peaceful?" Fat Ball blinked. "Can you make it simpler?"

Su Yu laughed, "It's about being fierce! Being wild! Liu Hong means you should act like a mad dog!"

"..." Liu Hong was speechless. Yes, that was what he meant. But why didn't Su Yu say it himself? He couldn't afford to offend this one.

Fat Ball didn't mind, but seemed to ponder, "You mean I've been raised too kindly and need to be more ruthless?"

Su Yu chuckled, "That's about right!"

Fat Ball bared its teeth, suddenly looking a bit dejected. "But I can't be fierce! How about I try being fierce for you, and you tell me if it's fierce enough?"

With that, it bared its teeth again, eyes wide, trying to look fierce.

A little puppy!

Su Yu was speechless, feeling an urge to pat its head. This wasn't fierce; it was adorable!

Fat Ball was small and chubby, looking more like a cuddly pet than a fierce beast. It had spent tens of thousands of years tending to flowers, and it really had become quite gentle, with a kind and pleasant demeanor... ahem, anyway, it was fun, just not like a fierce beast.

Su Yu actually had a way to make it fierce, but he was reluctant to try.

Meanwhile, Liu Hong and Hetu were holding back their laughter.

Adorably fierce, that's probably what this was!

Was this fierce?

Fat Ball seemed to sense something, and immediately looked dejected. "What should I do? I can't be fierce!"

Truly dejected!

Does this mean I can't become powerful?

Su Yu was silent for a moment. "Fierceness... maybe it's also a kind of instinct! I have a way, but are you willing to try? Actually, I think you're fine as you are now."

"Really? But... I want to be strong. You said my master is waiting for me to save him."

Su Yu paused, then suddenly said, "I lied to you!"

"What?"

"Your master is already dead. In the end, there was just a bit of willpower left. I've been deceiving you! Not only is your master dead, but your little master is dead too. They're all dead!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, "Actually, I've just been using you, saying your master isn't dead so you'd be my bodyguard. Do you understand?"

Fat Ball froze, staring blankly at Su Yu.

Su Yu remained calm, "They're all dead. I saw the Culture King's corpse behind the Heaven Gate, torn apart by a group of savage beasts. They ate him bit by bit, and he was in great pain..."

Fat Ball's eyes reddened.

"You... you lied to me?"

Su Yu nodded, "Yes, I lied to you, always have. Because I lack Heavenly Sovereign-level power on my side, I hoped you could be of use to me..."

"Roar!"

At that moment, a thunderous roar erupted from Fat Ball's mouth.

In the next instant, Fat Ball's body expanded countless times, its eyes turning blood red. "You said... my master is dead?"

"Dead!"

Su Yu gestured for Liu Hong and the others to leave.

"Why did you lie to me?"

"Because... you're too stupid!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "You're perfect material for a bodyguard. I thought, why not use you?"

"I'll bite you to death!"

Roar!

A furious roar echoed, and in the next moment, a massive mouth lunged at Su Yu!

Su Yu struck out with a palm!

But Fat Ball was incredibly fast, its eyes blood red. "My master is dead? No, you're lying... you must be lying!"

Boom!

With a loud crash, Su Yu's palm struck its mouth, causing it to bleed. He said calmly, "I'm not lying. They're dead. You're no match for me. Now, I don't need to placate you anymore. Remember, you're just a dog. Besides tending flowers, what else can you do?"

"I'll eat you!"

Awooo!

Another roar echoed, and soon, many powerful figures flew over, all looking surprised.

What happened?

Why did Fat Ball suddenly lose control?

Liu Hong quickly signaled everyone to leave, grinning. Su Yu was ruthless.

With just a few words, he had provoked Fat Ball into losing control!

...

"Roar!"

At this moment, Fat Ball was driven by pure instinct, furious, wanting to kill Su Yu, to eat him, not even using its boots.

However, today's Su Yu was not what he used to be.

At this moment, Su Yu punched out, sending Fat Ball flying, coldly saying, "You're too weak. Is this all you can do?"

"With this, you think you can eat me?"

"Your master was dismembered and eaten!"

"You foolish thing, all you can do is tend flowers. What else can you do?"

"Awooo!"

Fat Ball howled to the sky, its body expanding again, white fur turning black in an instant.

At this moment, a black dog appeared in the void.

"Awooo!"

With a roar, the black dog lunged at Su Yu, and this time, before Su Yu could send Fat Ball flying, he frowned slightly, feeling himself being drawn towards Fat Ball. Not only that, but even his power of the Great Dao seemed to be siphoned away!

"Awooo!"

Fat Ball bit into the void, and it seemed to have bitten into Su Yu's power of the Great Dao. With a crack, Su Yu's myriad powers were suddenly bitten and partially severed.

Su Yu was secretly alarmed!

He unleashed his full power, and with a thunderous boom, his aura surged again, punching Fat Ball away once more.

But Fat Ball was now somewhat out of control, wildly opening its mouth and flying towards Su Yu again, the power of the Great Dao growing even stronger.

"I'll eat you!"

A massive mouth, devouring the heavens and earth, Su Yu was once again drawn to its mouth by the suction!

Fat Ball bit down again!

Crack!

Su Yu's power of the Great Dao was bitten off again, and Su Yu, with a low shout, reconnected his powerful myriad powers, striking at it once more, punching Fat Ball's mouth until it bled.

"Besides tending flowers, who can you eat?"

"You seek death!"

Fat Ball roared madly again, its aura booming, growing much stronger, and in the blink of an eye, its aura seemed to be catching up to Su Yu!

Originally, Fat Ball could only be considered at the Heavenly King level.

Not even a Heavenly Sovereign, but with the boots, it could fight a Heavenly Sovereign. But now, its aura surged instantly, and more power of the Great Dao rushed into its body!

Boom!

The entire area was filled with violent energy!

Above Fat Ball's head, a black Fat Ball phantom lunged at Su Yu, this time, silently, truly a biting dog that doesn't bark.

Su Yu was startled.

He hurriedly retreated, and just as he did, with a crack, the void was bitten apart!

...

All around.

The Great Zhou King and others gasped, and at this moment, the Great Zhou King transmitted, "This... has it entered the realm of Heavenly Sovereign combat power?"

Fat Ball wasn't at the Heavenly Sovereign realm, which was the realm of the master of rules, but its combat power seemed to have reached that level now, right?

Wan Tiansheng nodded slightly, "Most likely it has!"

At this moment, even Su Yu had to avoid its edge. Fat Ball hadn't even used its boots yet.

But it seemed that Su Yu could still suppress Fat Ball.

Wan Tiansheng wasn't worried about this, but about something else, quickly transmitting, "This... Fat Ball is out of control. Isn't His Majesty worried about not being able to restore it?"

That's the real trouble!

At this moment, Fat Ball seemed to be blackened, and once it completely lost control, that would be a big problem!

Everyone was also shocked.

Yes, Fat Ball seemed to be blackened, its strength greatly increased. Could Su Yu suppress it?

...

Boom!

The sound of explosions rang out again, the void shattered.

At this moment, Fat Ball didn't even roar!

Its body was huge, yet incredibly fast. In the blink of an eye, its mouth opened, and a powerful devouring force swept over. Su Yu's body trembled slightly, and with a boom, he was swept back to Fat Ball's side.

"Crack!"

Another crisp sound, like glass shattering, Fat Ball's teeth gleamed coldly. This bite wasn't just aimed at the physical body; even the power of the Great Dao was bitten and shattered.

Su Yu frowned.

Just as he was about to explode again, suddenly, a large foot descended from the sky!

Boom!

With this foot, Su Yu punched out, but was stomped directly downward by the foot.

Not only that, but foot after foot stomped down, causing Su Yu's physical body to explode.

At this moment, Su Yu was also a top-tier expert.

However, the blackened and powerful Fat Ball, combined with the boots, stomped him down repeatedly.

Boom!

With another loud crash, Su Yu was stomped into the ground, the earth shattered, and countless deathly auras surged up.

Fat Ball instantly charged into the ground, its massive boot stomping down again!

Boom!

The ground cracked, revealing a massive black hole.

The silent battle continued, Fat Ball's aura growing stronger!

And Su Yu, in an instant, flew out, slashing with a blade!

With a bang, the long blade slashed the boot away.

Su Yu shattered the void, appearing above Fat Ball's head in the blink of an eye, stomping down.

Fat Ball turned and lunged at Su Yu, seemingly wanting to bite him to death.

Su Yu hurriedly withdrew his leg, but Fat Ball bit his leg, and Su Yu punched out, almost blowing its head apart, yet Fat Ball refused to let go!

"Awooo!"

A beastly roar came from its throat, Fat Ball's eyes blood red, its aura growing stronger, refusing to let go, determined to bite this bastard to death!

Su Yu punched it several times, but his leg was almost bitten off, and it still wouldn't let go.

Su Yu had beaten it until its head was bleeding, and it still wouldn't let go.

If he kept hitting it, Su Yu worried he might blow its head apart.

Feeling a bit helpless, this blackening was too severe!

Moments later, Su Yu's Sanctification Seal flew out, attempting to soothe Fat Ball. "I was just kidding. Your master is still alive, just wanted to give you a little shock. Fat Ball, wake up!"

Fat Ball ignored him, continuing to bite ferociously, tearing into his leg until it was a bloody mess.

Su Yu kept trying to calm it down. "I really was just teasing you. Look, you've even advanced!"

"Argh!"

A growl rumbled from Fat Ball's throat, as if it wanted to bite him to death.

Soon, others started to approach.

The Great Zhou King and a few others frowned. At this moment, Fat Ball was biting Su Yu so fiercely that his flesh was torn and bones were exposed.

The Great Zhou King transmitted his voice, "Your Majesty, suppress it. It's out of control!"

Su Yu waved his hand, vigorously rubbing Fat Ball's black head, smiling. This little guy, it could transform—something he hadn't expected. After transforming and controlling the boots, its combat power was indeed formidable. That Eight-Winged Tiger from before might not have been a match for this Fat Ball.

Could this black dog be the Sun Devouring Divine Dog?

After rubbing Fat Ball's head for a while longer, seeing it still wouldn't let go, Su Yu thought for a moment and took out the Sanctification Seal. A gentle, soothing power seeped into Fat Ball.

Fat Ball's blood-red eyes gradually cleared.

Su Yu chuckled, "I really was just teasing you. Your master is alive and well. Not only that, before he left, he even reminded me to help him court girls. Could someone like that die so easily?"

"And the Time Sage is also alive and well. Really, there's nothing to worry about. Stop biting, you're really biting!"

The Sanctification Seal emitted a gentle energy, and the cracks on the seal widened slightly. Su Yu had used it once on the West King's Consort, and later in the River of Time on the Martial Emperor. Now, using it on Fat Ball, it showed signs of breaking.

Su Yu observed carefully. Perhaps one more use, and it would shatter.

Releasing a bit more power, Fat Ball gradually calmed down. Only then did Su Yu put away the Sanctification Seal.

He shook his leg, but Fat Ball still wouldn't let go. It seemed to have fallen asleep, its black fur gradually fading back to white.

Seeing this, Su Yu didn't mind, continuing to walk with a dog hanging from his leg.

The Great Zhou King and others looked at him. Su Yu smiled, "It's nothing. This little guy, its strength increases just like that. It just needs a trigger. If it can use its blackened state power in its normal state, without the boots, even ordinary Heavenly Sovereigns might not be able to match it!"

With the boots, it would truly have top-tier Heavenly Sovereign combat power!

At this moment, it had become the strongest under Su Yu's command. Even the South King was slightly weaker than Fat Ball.

"Your Majesty... should we wake it up? It won't lose control again, will it?"

"No need!"

Su Yu glanced at the Fat Ball enveloped in white light on his head and laughed, "It's too tired!"

Too tired?

Everyone fell into contemplation. What did that mean?

The Book Spirit, who had just flown over, understood Su Yu's meaning and bowed slightly, "Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Fat Ball was tired.

A hundred thousand years!

No, more than a hundred thousand years. Ever since the Culture King and the others went to the Luminous Domain Mansion, it had been planting flowers, planting flowers, planting flowers... Watering them every three days, while others were in slumber, in seclusion, cultivating, meditating... Only it watered the flowers every three days and cleaned the small courtyard almost daily.

Too tired!

Day after day, year after year!

Not just one or two years, but tens of thousands of years!

Now, the energy of the Sanctification Seal had put Fat Ball into a slumber. It was too exhausted, and this sudden relaxation naturally made it fall asleep.

"Snore..."

At this moment, everyone heard the soft snoring from the little white dog's nose. For a moment, their expressions were strange. Fat Ball had really fallen asleep!

But, biting Su Yu's leg like this wasn't appropriate!

"Your Majesty!"

Su Yu waved his hand, "It's fine. As cultivators, having a dog hanging on us doesn't it make us look more imposing?"

"......"

Everyone suddenly laughed.

Having a dog hanging on you... well, if Su Yu didn't mind, they wouldn't say anything more.

The Great Zhou King didn't say anything else, just wondered, "Has it reached the Heavenly Sovereign realm?"

Su Yu nodded, "I'm not sure about its normal state, but the blackened Fat Ball definitely has Heavenly Sovereign combat power! With the Culture King's boots, it's even stronger. It's weaker than me, but not by much!"

He continued with a smile, "Its blackened state might be its true self! Have you ever seen an ancient beast so pure-hearted?"

Fat Ball was indeed quite kind.

When Su Yu first entered, Fat Ball warmly welcomed him. Except for not allowing him into the Culture King's room, everything else was negotiable.

When Su Yu went to borrow blood essence, it lent him a lot in one go.

The Culture King and the Time Sage were its only solace.

This time, it blackened because Su Yu said the Culture King and the others were dead, causing Fat Ball to blacken.

As Su Yu walked, with a snoring dog hanging from his leg, he smiled and suddenly grabbed the Little Furball from Big Furball's head in the distance. "Little Furball, the Culture King raised a dog to guard his house for tens of thousands of years. I've raised you for quite some time now. Will you guard my house in the future?"

Little Furball's big eyes were full of dejection, ignoring Su Yu.

Recently, it didn't like Xiangxiang anymore and hadn't licked any divine characters for a long time.

When needed, it was the God Devouring Crown Prince. When not needed, it was just Little Furball.

Now he wanted it to guard his house, no way!

"No!"

Little Furball was aggrieved!

He already had new companions, and it was still Eternal, not going to guard his house!

Su Yu laughed, pinching Little Furball until its tongue almost stuck out.

Su Yu said, "Being weak is good. Being too strong is useless. Being too strong will get you killed! Look at Fat Ball, it's lived until now, and no one cares. It's because it was too weak compared to the Culture King back then! You're the same! Compared to me now, you're weaker! After countless years, you'll be like Fat Ball. One day, if I disappear, maybe you'll still be around..."

"Someday, if this era is sealed, maybe you'll still exist!"

Su Yu laughed, "When they seal an era, they seal the strong. I haven't seen ordinary people being sealed. Weak ones being sealed, being weak is good!"

With a sigh, Su Yu laughed, "Don't be upset. Fat Ball belongs to the Culture King, aren't you mine?"

"......"

Little Furball suddenly blinked, its eyes turning into crescents, its mood suddenly brightening, "I want to eat divine characters!"

Su Yu laughed, grabbing it and pressing it into his Heaven Gate.

"It's full of food inside!"

Stuffing Furball in, Su Yu looked at the others and smiled, "Fat Ball has become a Heavenly Sovereign. I hope everyone can catch up soon! With this successful resurrection, the South King will surely succeed, and Lanshan has hope too!"

With that, Su Yu quickly reached the edge of chaos.

Today, he was going to resurrect Hetu here.

As for Fat Ball's advancement, it was just a topic on the road, a sudden idea.

Success was good, failure was no big deal.

And just as Su Yu was preparing to resurrect Hetu, Fat Ball suddenly opened its eyes, glanced at Su Yu, then sneakily at the others, and then at Su Yu's leg, which it had bitten into a bloody mess. Suddenly, a hint of embarrassment appeared in its eyes, and it quickly closed them again.

Pretending to sleep!

Su Yu smiled, feeling a sense of irony. Even dogs knew embarrassment. Humans... were truly complicated.

"Hetu, come on, prepare for resurrection!"

Hetu quickly approached, a mix of tension and solemnity on his face.

Resurrection, a long-held desire, now was the chance, but it was also a gamble!

...

At this moment.

At the entrance corresponding to the lower realm of Soul Burying Mountain.

Two figures appeared, March looking around warily, while Giant Axe sighed, "We're back!"

Finally back!

March didn't speak, sensing around, quickly flying towards the Iron Devourer Realm, speaking as he flew, "Let's go to my realm first, we still don't know the situation in the Human Realm!"

Soon, one person and one cat reached the Iron Devourer Realm.

March sensed and was stunned.

Where are my people?

Not a single one left!

Could they all be dead?

Giant Axe was also bewildered, quickly offering comfort in a low voice, "Brother March, there are still clansmen in the Upper Realm. Even if the lower realm is wiped out, there's hope. Don't be too disheartened. Once the Upper Realm develops, everything will be fine!"

So pitiful!

Sympathizing with March.

Giant Axe comforted him for a while, feeling sorry for March. It was over, the Iron Devourer Race was gone.

Could it be Hundred Battle's doing?

That... would be very troublesome!

But March was speechless, frowning. They definitely weren't dead. If they were, he would have felt something. Where did everyone go?

Soon, March grabbed a wandering creature outside the realm.

He didn't expect to get any information, but unexpectedly learned that Su Yu had led people to evacuate to the Death Realm, and they had done so with great fanfare, sinking the entire Abyssal Realm!

March was slightly stunned. They went to the Death Realm?

So, was their strength restored or not?

Giant Axe sympathized again, "Poor thing, this... Hundred Battle went too far, driving them to the Death Realm. Is that place fit for living? With death energy everywhere, life there is unbearable!"

Too tragic!

Thinking of this, Giant Axe sighed, "The losses last time were too severe. This conflict with the Control King's lineage was to save us. Forget it, if Su Yu's side, besides that dog, has another Heavenly King... I'll... I'll help him!"

Too pitiful, fine, I'll lower my standards!

In this situation, let alone three Heavenly Kings, if there's another one besides Fat Ball, it would be a miracle!

After all, he was once a Human Lord, but now he's in such a miserable state!

"Hundred Battle isn't a good person either. Even if he conquered the Human Realm, he should have left them a place to stay. Not even allowing them to live in the Myriad Realms, driving them to the Death Realm, isn't that extermination?"

The Giant Axe sighed helplessly, "How can a king behave like this? It's completely inappropriate!"

After scolding Hundred Battle a few times, he turned to March and asked, "So, what do we do now?"

"Let's head to the Abyssal Realm and see what's going on there!" March was also at a loss for what to do. He decided it was best to find Su Yu and the others first. Initially, he hadn't thought much of it, but after Giant Axe's words, he suddenly realized that Su Yu might be having a tough time. Their entire race might be suffering alongside him... perhaps even in dire straits!

With this thought, March's face filled with sympathy. 

Truly pitiful!
