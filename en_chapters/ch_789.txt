Chapter 789: Meeting the Scholar Tiger Again, Subduing Destiny

Land of Chaos.

Su Yu was unsure if Xingyue had reached the Human Emperor's side, but he knew she was safe. The path of life and death was with Xingyue, and Su Yu could control her life and death.

At this moment, Su Yu began to delve deeper into the chaos.

Chaos had no time, no boundaries, no rules. Here, it was darkness, it was void. Perhaps there were some dangers, some continents, some divine mountains within the chaos, but they were rare. Places like Chaos Mountain were actually extensions that emerged after the opening of the heavens, not true chaos.

True chaos was just like what Su Yu saw now—dark, deathly silent, perhaps going years without seeing any sign of life.

...

Venturing deeper into chaos.

Exploring the route, investigating how to reach the Upper Realm. The South King and his group were actually paving the way ahead, dealing with most of the dangers.

Su Yu's speed was not slow. Since those like the Chaos Dragon could come and go to the Upper Realm, it meant the route was clear, as long as there were no dangers along the way.

The distance shouldn't be too far. Su Yu remembered that last time, after he opened the heavens, a large bird from the Upper Realm arrived shortly after. This suggested that the distance was relatively close, and one could traverse it directly.

As Su Yu proceeded, he encountered an ancient beast. Its strength wasn't particularly formidable, and Su Yu killed it with a single slap.

Along the way, Su Yu also noticed traces of battles, with energy fluctuations in the void, indicating the handiwork of the South King and his group. He continued to track them.

After about half a day, Su Yu caught up with the South King and his group.

...

Deep in the chaos, a small, broken mountain floated in the void.

At this moment, the South King and his group were here. The South King, Lantian, Tianhuo, Fat Ball, and Lanshan were all present. However, they hadn't moved forward.

When Su Yu's faint energy fluctuation reached them, the South King quickly sensed it and turned to look. From behind, Su Yu drifted over. Sensing that everyone was here, Su Yu was slightly puzzled.

Why had they stopped?

Following their gaze, Su Yu looked ahead and saw a glimmer of light.

Seeing Su Yu's arrival, the South King quickly transmitted a message, "There seems to be land ahead. We're not sure if it's the Chaos Mountain area or what the situation is, but just now, some ancient beasts flew over from there. We're worried that entering rashly might expose us."

"Many ancient beasts?"

"Quite a few, five or six ancient beasts flew over in succession!"

That was indeed quite a number. In chaos, encountering ancient beasts was rare, so seeing five or six at once suggested this place might really be Chaos Mountain.

Su Yu looked over there, then at the broken mountain they were resting on. It was incredibly sturdy. In the past, this small mountain would have been a treasure, but now Su Yu wasn't too impressed.

"No worries!" Su Yu smiled. "You all wait here, I'll go take a look!"

With that, Su Yu transformed into a giant fierce tiger, chaos energy emanating from his body!

With a roar to the sky, Su Yu swiftly flew forward.

It was just a disguise!

Nowadays, with the power of myriad paths, Su Yu could easily analyze chaos. Disguising chaos energy was simple; it was just a mix of myriad paths' chaotic forces. Organizing it was difficult, but mixing it was not.

Behind him, Lantian quickly transformed, turning into a gray eagle in the blink of an eye, spreading its wings and flying directly towards Su Yu, also emanating chaos energy.

The others could only watch.

Currently, few could transform chaos energy.

...

"Why did you follow?" Su Yu asked, and Lantian transmitted back, "Following Your Majesty, to prevent any crisis!"

Su Yu chuckled, underestimating whom?

Since you came, so be it!

"How is your comprehension of the myriad divine characters?" Su Yu asked.

"Average!" Lantian transmitted back with a smile, "Your Majesty need not worry. Achieving Heavenly Sovereign combat power isn't too difficult. With a bit of comprehension, I'll soon possess Heavenly Sovereign combat power!"

It's not a big deal.

Just a minor issue!

You're impressive!

Su Yu didn't bother saying much. Among his subordinates, there were only a few he needed to guide. The rest didn't require his guidance.

The two flew towards the light, and soon, their eyes lit up.

A massive continent appeared before them.

Chaos Mountain!

It must be Chaos Mountain.

As they reached the edge of the continent, they heard human voices, speaking in the human language.

"Here they come again!"

"Recently, ancient beasts have been flying in from the depths of chaos. Are the Tailless Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger really planning to gather ancient beasts here and become kings?"

"Strange, why have these two ancient beasts occupied Chaos Mountain and not left? With their strength, even in the depths of chaos, they aren't weak... Ancient beasts prefer to wander in chaos. Why have they settled on Chaos Mountain?"

"Who knows! These two new ancient beasts aren't weak either, both have Daofuse combat power. Record it..."

Su Yu and Lantian glanced over and saw two people.

Their strength wasn't weak.

One had roughly third-tier Daofuse power, the other second-tier.

Despite Su Yu's current many powerful subordinates, second-tier Daofuse was the strength of figures like Tiangu and Old Turtle in the past. It wasn't weak, and such individuals were strong in any place. Today, there were many kings, but they were still limited in number.

These two were just standing on a small mountain watching them, truly bold.

Seeing Su Yu and Lantian looking their way, one of the men suddenly erupted with a powerful chaos force, sending a wave of willpower, "My territory!"

Chaos force!

Su Yu understood; this was a disguise as a chaos ancient beast. Although in human form... ancient beasts didn't care about form. As long as they weren't rejected by chaos and possessed chaos force, they were considered part of the chaos ancient race.

Among ancient beasts, occupying territory meant it couldn't be infringed upon. Ancient beasts valued strength above all.

"People from the Control King's lineage?" Su Yu asked, and Lantian transmitted back, "Who else could it be?"

No one else!

Definitely from the Control King's lineage!

This lineage was impressive, having taken root deep in Chaos Mountain. Judging by their familiarity with ancient beasts and chaos, the key was whether these guys had ever explored chaos deeply?

Otherwise, they should know it connects to the Lower Realm and the Death Realm.

Or perhaps they knew but were too lazy to go?

No, maybe they didn't dare?

Still not right. Could it be that previously, due to the presence of terrifying beings like the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger blocking the way, these people didn't dare to explore deeply?

This guess seemed plausible!

The Eight-Winged Tiger was not far from the chaos near the Death Realm. When Su Yu opened the heavens, the Eight-Winged Tiger arrived quickly!

With such a terrifying Heavenly Sovereign-level presence blocking the way, it was normal for the Control King's lineage not to dare to explore rashly.

Thinking this, Su Yu ignored them.

Now wasn't the time to act against them!

First, find the Eight-Winged Tiger!

From what they said, most of the ancient beasts coming from chaos were here to join the Eight-Winged Tiger and Tailless Dragon. Were these two planning to establish a sect in Chaos Mountain?

What were they thinking?

Su Yu was also puzzled. These two weren't staying in chaos. Knowing the dangers of Chaos Mountain, why come here? What was the idea?

Not to mention the Tailless Dragon, but the Eight-Winged Tiger wasn't foolish.

This self-proclaimed Scholar Tiger wasn't lacking in intelligence. It wouldn't be unaware of the dangers here, yet it still came. Indeed, Su Yu found it hard to understand.

March knew the location of the Eight-Winged Tiger, and Su Yu had inquired about it. Now, he headed straight for the Eight-Winged Tiger's location.

Behind him, the two from the Control King's lineage continued their conversation, "Are these the subordinates summoned by the Eight-Winged Tiger? Recently, more and more ancient beasts have been coming!"

"Who says otherwise? At this rate, Chaos Mountain will be in danger. What are these guys here for?"

"The Gate of Hell, what else could it be?"

"..."

Their voices weren't loud, but for Su Yu, eavesdropping was easy. Hearing this, he was slightly startled.

The Gate of Hell!

Were the Eight-Winged Tiger and Tailless Dragon here for the Gate of Hell?

The Gate of Hell... did they want to enter it, or what?

Lantian clearly heard it too, transmitting, "Your Majesty, what benefit does the Gate of Hell have for them? These two were previously in chaos and knew about the Gate of Hell. Why didn't they come before, and why come now, knowing the myriad races and the Control King's lineage are at odds? It's very strange!"

Indeed, it was strange!

Even if they wanted to fish in troubled waters, the best way was to hide in chaos. Why reveal themselves directly?

Were they imitating him?

The key was, did these two also have informants?

The more he thought, the less he understood.

Forget it, if he couldn't understand, he wouldn't think about it.

He'd see the Eight-Winged Tiger first. If cooperation couldn't be achieved, it didn't matter. He'd probe first.

...

Chaos Mountain, at the end of the Chaos River.

This was also the edge of Chaos Mountain, where a massive mountain stood.

Now, this mountain was occupied by the Eight-Winged Tiger.

The entire mountain was teeming with ancient beasts, their auras interwoven.

Although the Eight-Winged Tiger hadn't been here long, it quickly subdued the ancient beasts in the area with its formidable strength. Along with the Chaos Dragon, it dominated the north and south, commanding three or four dozen Daofuse ancient beasts, making it a formidable force!

Currently, four major forces occupied the east, west, south, and north.

Outside Chaos Mountain, in the east, the myriad races held sway.

In the west, at the end, the Control King's lineage held sway.

In the south and north, the Eight-Winged Tiger occupied the south, and the Chaos Dragon the north.

The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon hadn't allied. The dragon and tiger didn't get along. The Tailless Dragon couldn't subdue the Eight-Winged Tiger, and the Eight-Winged Tiger had no interest in cooperating with it, so they remained separate.

Because of their presence, the myriad races and the Control King's lineage had recently calmed down, ceasing their battles.

These two forces acted like troublemakers, disrupting the war!

Moreover, recently, both sides seemed to be summoning chaos ancient beasts, with more and more coming to join, as if they really intended to stay.

...

At this moment, atop the high mountain.

At the summit.

A stone-carved grand hall appeared, where two figures sat, sipping tea. Yes, tea.

One of them had a tiger-like head, appearing honest and simple, with the faint character "King" etched on his forehead—an Eight-Winged Tiger. The other was the ethereal and sage-like Destiny Marquis.

As for the tea... Destiny Marquis outwardly maintained a calm demeanor, but inwardly, he was cursing. "To hell with your tea!"

He had no idea where this Eight-Winged Tiger had procured some soy sauce... perhaps that was it? Destiny Marquis hadn't seen such a thing in ages. He had tasted it long ago, but now, the Eight-Winged Tiger was savoring it with relish.

The Eight-Winged Tiger, in his transformed human form, wore an incongruous white robe, which made Destiny Marquis uncomfortable. He wanted to criticize but had to keep a smiling face. Moreover, on the stone table lay an ancient book. The Eight-Winged Tiger was even reading it, nodding and swaying as if deeply engrossed.

Destiny Marquis was at a loss for words. Dressed in a white scholar's robe, drinking soy sauce, and reading a trashy book titled "Eighteen Styles of Dismemberment," nodding along—anyone would think they had entered the wrong place.

This was the lair of the Eight-Winged Tiger. The stone hall even had a grand name—Dao Palace! Two large characters, carved in a dog-paddle style, hung outside, not at all embarrassed by their simplicity.

Destiny Marquis had been here for three days, reading with this tiger and drinking dozens of cups of soy sauce, each time courteously refilled by the Eight-Winged Tiger.

Seeing Destiny Marquis's soy sauce running low, the Eight-Winged Tiger, all smiles, stood up and refilled his cup, displaying a generous attitude. "See, I'm sharing my good stuff with you! Don't be shy, drink up! We have plenty more!"

Such hospitality left Destiny Marquis speechless. He finally spoke, "Tiger Sovereign, what are your thoughts on what I mentioned?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger, swaying his head and carrying a bookish air, replied, "As the book says, 'Isn't it delightful to have friends come from afar?' I should welcome you with open arms and engage in candlelit discussions. I see you as a fellow scholar; reading requires tranquility. I wish to exchange insights on the Great Dao with you..."

Destiny Marquis was utterly disheartened. "Go find a scholar to chat with; I can't keep up with you. I should have gone to the Tailless Dragon instead."

"Tiger Sovereign, the myriad races and the Control King's lineage are at odds. Involving yourself and the Chaos Dragon might not be wise. Though powerful, being caught between them is dangerous. If war breaks out, you two will be the first to suffer."

The Eight-Winged Tiger shook his head, swaying again, "As the saying goes, 'A wise man does not stand under a dangerous wall.' This is true! If it's dangerous, why would I stand in harm's way? Our division has its deeper meaning."

Destiny Marquis felt increasingly weary. "Tiger Sovereign, then..."

"Hold on!" The Eight-Winged Tiger carefully took out some powder, smiling, "This is sugar. I've recently created a soy sauce sweet-and-sour tea. Would you like to try it? It's quite tasty!"

Destiny Marquis was on the verge of madness. He prided himself on his patience, but this tiger was driving him insane!

He couldn't help but ask, "Tiger Sovereign, where did you get these... treasures?"

Whoever gave them to him, I want to hang them up and beat them! And these books, what's going on? Is this tiger being kept by someone? Otherwise, it doesn't make sense!

"Why can't these treasures be my own creations?" The Eight-Winged Tiger, feeling slightly underestimated, tugged at his book bag. Of course, he sensed the impatience of the other, but what's the rush? As they say, "Haste makes waste!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger pondered, "Do you know what tofu tastes like?"

Destiny Marquis was truly losing it. Tofu, your mother! Are you addicted to this? I'm a normal person, and you're driving me crazy.

Destiny Marquis, exhausted, quickly suggested, "Why not visit my Ren Mountain? We have everything there."

"Really? I must find time to visit, but not now... Would you like another cup? By the way, what does wine taste like? As they say, 'A thousand cups are too few for a true friend.' You don't seem to enjoy soy sauce; how about we drink wine instead? A thousand cups wouldn't be enough!"

"I..."

"Are you worried about speaking the truth after drinking? As they say, 'Wine is a poison that passes through the intestines, causing mistakes and emboldening cowards, revealing truths.' Are you afraid of speaking the truth after drinking?"

When faced with such a chaotic ancient beast, all you can think of is dying.

Destiny Marquis was a refined person! Refined people don't like to lose their temper. He held back, wanting to get angry but restraining himself. I must endure!

At that moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger's expression suddenly changed, not in the usual startled way. A special power spread through the air, accompanied by laughter, "Oh, familiar faces! Tiger Brother seems to have noticed me. Destiny Brother is here too?"

Destiny Marquis was startled! The Eight-Winged Tiger's expression shifted slightly, forcing a smile, "Su Sovereign, long time no see, as they say..."

"Shut up, don't spout literature in front of me!" With laughter, the void rippled slightly, and two figures appeared.

Two chairs materialized out of thin air. Su Yu and Lantian took their seats. Su Yu glanced at the soy sauce tea and chuckled, "What is this? Is soy sauce meant to be drunk like this? Let's add some tea leaves!"

With that, jade tea cups appeared, tea leaves materialized, and Heavenly Source Water emerged. Tea was brewed!

"Destiny Brother, are you in a hurry to leave?"

Destiny Marquis, his face serious, sat back down, laughing softly, "Of course not!" But his heart was in turmoil! Su Yu! How does he know the Eight-Winged Tiger? And what is his strength? Why does he seem unfathomable?

The Eight-Winged Tiger also appeared slightly uneasy, suppressing his agitation with a smile, "Su Sovereign..."

"Don't call me Sovereign; only those of low status use that term. I prefer being called Emperor, Su Emperor, or Emperor Yu. It makes me happier!"

Su Yu, upon arrival, took charge. The Eight-Winged Tiger chuckled, "Then... Su Emperor, so Sovereign is derogatory. This Destiny Sovereign has always called me Tiger Sovereign..."

Su Yu laughed, "It's not really derogatory. Anyone below a ruler of laws can be called that. But... am I not of higher status than you? What do you think, Eight-Winged Brother?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger thought for a moment and nodded. Yes, he admitted it. Because this was an opener of the heavens! Being of higher status was normal.

Destiny Marquis felt uneasy. Su Yu then looked at him, smiling, "I was thinking of meeting you, Destiny Brother. You should know the situation; Wuming has joined me! You took Changhe away, so you should be aware of some things."

Destiny Marquis frowned slightly, speaking solemnly, "I know a bit, but... does Su Emperor have the confidence to deal with the myriad races and the Control King's lineage? If not, taking sides now is too risky for me!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment and then smiled, "Why don't you ask Brother Tiger? Brother Tiger, if we add three or four more Heavenly Venerables on our side, can we take on the Myriad Races?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger thought for a moment and nodded, "With a few more Heavenly Venerables, it's possible!"

Destiny was taken aback, "Tiger Venerable, there are quite a few Heavenly Venerables among the Myriad Races!"

"I know, didn't you just mention that?" The Eight-Winged Tiger replied curiously, "Su Emperor has many strong warriors under his command. With a few more Heavenly Venerables, we can definitely fight. What's the problem?"

At this moment, Destiny was stunned. Are you two playing me? But... does the Eight-Winged Tiger need to play me?

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "March and Giant Axe have both joined my ranks! Besides them, Fat Ball has grown stronger since last time, and the South King has reached the Heavenly Venerable level. If Marquis Destiny is willing to join, we have quite a few Heavenly Venerables on our side!"

He continued, "Lantian is also close."

It was only now that Marquis Destiny realized something and suddenly looked at Lantian, shocked to find that Lantian... wasn't dead! He had almost overlooked it!

Only now did he notice that Lantian's strength seemed even greater than during the last battle with the Control King's lineage. If Lantian wasn't dead, then what about the others?

He hurriedly asked, "So, who actually died last time?"

"No one died," Su Yu said, sipping his tea with a smile. "The Human Race is far more mysterious than you think. Not a single one of us died. Not only on my side, but even those Shadow guys didn't die!"

"It seems like no one died last time, but everyone got stronger."

"......"

Marquis Destiny was already in a daze, utterly shocked. Not a single death? How is that possible! You killed a Heavenly Venerable, several Heavenly Kings, and dozens of Daofuse cultivators, and you're telling me not one of you died!

Su Yu laughed, "Is it so hard to believe? Since you captured Changhe, you should know I'm not the kind of fool who would go fight Yuehao and the others for no reason if there were casualties."

Su Yu continued, "I just wanted to expose the strength of the Control King's lineage and, incidentally, lower my profile a bit."

Marquis Destiny exclaimed, "Emperor Yu, what a brilliant strategy!"

"Not really," Su Yu shook his head. "If I had enough strength, why would I need these little tricks? They'd be meaningless!"

Destiny took a deep breath, "Then may I ask, what brings Emperor Yu here this time?"

"I'm here to find the Eight-Winged Tiger!" Su Yu smiled, "I'm coming to the Upper Realm soon, so I wanted to chat with Brother Tiger first to make sure he doesn't mess up my plans!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger chuckled awkwardly, "How could I!"

Su Yu was curious, "What are you doing here? I'm puzzled. You're not stupid! Don't tell me you're just here to watch the fun? I heard you're here for the Gate of Hell. Are you planning to go in? If you do, wouldn't it be better to wait for the Myriad Races and the Control King's lineage to fight and sneak in? Now it seems like you're trying to prevent a war between them. Why?"

Indeed, it seemed like they were trying to prevent a war.

The Eight-Winged Tiger laughed, "No..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "Forget it, if you don't want to say, then don't. Of course, I have my plans, but anyone who stands in my way, no matter how strong, might have to die!"

"......"

The Eight-Winged Tiger was speechless. Was that a threat? Perhaps it was!

After a moment of silence, he spoke, "I have no intention of opposing Su Emperor! I and the Chaos Dragon are indeed here because of the Gate of Hell! The commotion caused by Su Emperor earlier disturbed the Gate of Hell, and a will emerged from within!"

He paused to explain, "Moreover, recently, someone inside the Gate of Hell seems to want to break through the taboo and force their way out! Although the Gate of Hell hasn't opened yet, like some other places, its seal has loosened, allowing some weaker beings to come out early!"

Su Yu nodded.

The Eight-Winged Tiger continued, "This time, because Su Emperor disturbed some existences within the Gate of Hell, they want to work together to bring out a strong being who has reached the realm of the ruler of laws!"

"Chaos is sealed, so the possibility of a Chaos Ancient Clan member coming out is low. More likely, it's someone from the Control King's lineage, and they might bring out a being at the realm of the ruler of laws!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he looked at Destiny. Was it the woman who spoke last time? The one who intimidated the Sun Corona Heavenly Venerable? Is she coming out?

Su Yu was puzzled, "What does that have to do with you?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger explained, "It has everything to do with us! The Chaos Dragon and I are both from the Chaos Ancient Clan. If the other side brings out the will of the Chaos Ancient Clan from the Gate of Hell, once they appear, both the Chaos Dragon and I will be somewhat restrained or even commanded by her!"

Su Yu looked at him, and the Eight-Winged Tiger thought for a moment before adding, "So, the Chaos Dragon and I have a plan... to devour her Chaos will!"

"......"

Su Yu was stunned, "You want to kill her?"

"Yes!" The Eight-Winged Tiger didn't hide it because he knew there was enmity between this side and that side.

Destiny couldn't help but ask, "Then why stop the Myriad Races from fighting them?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger was speechless, "We can't start the war now! Bringing that person out requires the Control King's lineage to make a significant effort. Since it's their person coming out, they will definitely spend a great deal to bring them out! Once the war starts, it will be difficult for this person to appear!"

"If you start the war now, how will they bring the person out of the Gate of Hell?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger explained, "So, the Chaos Dragon and I are now gathering various ancient beasts to wait for that person to come out and then surround and kill them!"

Destiny said in a deep voice, "Then you can cooperate. Why not cooperate with the Myriad Races?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger was speechless, "You're quite foolish! If we weren't cooperating, do you think I'd entertain you for several days? It's just to show our value! Anyway, there's no rush. We can delay... The Chaos Dragon and I mean to delay until the person comes out, then join forces with you! To prevent you from attacking prematurely!"

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Once they're out, there will be another ruler of laws!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger nodded, "If they weren't a ruler of laws, we wouldn't be interested! The Chaos Dragon and I are both close to that realm. Before being injured by Su Emperor, the Chaos Dragon was even stronger than me..."

"What?" Destiny was shocked. The Tailless Dragon was injured by Su Yu?

Su Yu frowned slightly, and Destiny was helpless. This... is unbelievable! It's said that even now, that being's strength is not weaker than the Sun Corona! That being was actually injured by Su Yu? It's hard to believe!

The Eight-Winged Tiger ignored him. If Su Yu hadn't come, he wouldn't have told the truth. At this moment, he explained, "Our idea is to wait for that person to appear, then cooperate with the Myriad Races. Our cooperation means one thing: we deal with that ruler of laws, and the Myriad Races fight the Control King's lineage! The Myriad Races will definitely be willing because the ruler of laws is the most troublesome! And we need the Myriad Races to help us hold off the Control King's lineage!"

"This timing can't be too early or too late; it has to be just right!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger laughed, "Too early, like now, and the Myriad Races might attack prematurely, causing the summoning to fail! Too late, and the other side will have a foothold and grow stronger! So, we need a perfect time to strike the Control King's lineage!"

Destiny felt like crying. My heavens! Even Chaos Ancient Beasts are using strategies now. So, they deliberately delayed him! Just to delay until the time they need!

The Eight-Winged Tiger added, "So now, the Chaos Dragon and I have the same idea: to first prevent a war between the two sides! Once successful, both the Chaos Dragon and I have a chance to become true rulers of laws!"

He looked at Su Yu, "If Su Emperor hadn't come and wasn't strong, I would worry that Su Emperor would ruin our plans, and I wouldn't have told Su Emperor!"

Su Yu smiled, "I see!"

"Are you sure that if you devour that person, you can advance?"

"We can!" The Eight-Winged Tiger nodded, "She carries the will of some ancient existences behind the Gate of Hell. If we devour it, we can definitely advance! The key is, if we advance now, those existences behind the Gate of Hell can't do anything to us!"

He laughed, "Otherwise, if we wait for them to come out, we won't have a chance!"

Su Yu rubbed his chin, "So now, you, us, and the Myriad Races all have a common goal: to eliminate the Control King's lineage! You want to eliminate that ruler of laws, and so do we. We have a common premise!"

Su Yu laughed, "In that case, I think there's a basis for cooperation! It's a good thing!"

Destiny hesitated to speak! He was very worried that this was like seeking skin with a tiger! Truly seeking skin with a tiger! If they advance to true rulers of laws, it will be troublesome. Two ancient beasts are very strong!

Su Yu seemed to have guessed, and he laughed, "What are you afraid of? Brother Destiny, what if two more rulers of laws emerge? Nowadays, there are quite a few rulers of laws: the Martial Emperor, the Nether Emperor, and probably Hundred Battle as well. The Control King's lineage, that woman who came out last time, is also... It's hard to say on the Myriad Races' side. On my side, in a few days, I will be one too. What are you afraid of? With two more, it will be even more lively!"

Destiny was shaken, "Emperor Yu... what do you mean?"

"Nothing..." Su Yu suddenly struck, suppressing with one hand. Destiny was startled and vanished in an instant, but in the blink of an eye, he was surrounded from all sides. The next moment, a mighty aura, the power of myriad paths, suppressed him!

Su Yu retracted his hand with a smile, "Brother Destiny, what do you think?"

Destiny was shocked beyond words! "So strong!" Not only strong, but when Su Yu struck, he almost didn't feel the fluctuation of the myriad paths. Why is that?

The Eight-Winged Tiger wasn't surprised, just a bit emotional, "Su Emperor is indeed stronger after opening the heavens!"

Su Yu laughed, "Just average. I'm probably the weakest of the heaven-openers. I probably can't beat a true ruler of laws, just enough to fight the Chaos Dragon and the current ancestor of the Control King's lineage! I'm not afraid of the Sun Corona and those guys, but the Martial Emperor, the Nether Emperor, the one inside the Gate of Hell, and Hundred Battle, these four, I'm probably still not their match!"

Su Yu laughed, "If we were to rank the current strong ones in the Myriad Realms, these four would be first-tier! I, the Chaos Dragon, and the ancestor of the Control King's lineage would be second-tier. Brother Tiger, the Sun Corona, Fat Ball, and the South King, you guys would be third-tier!"

Three tiers down, and he hadn't even mentioned Destiny!

Heavenly Fate was taken aback. Were there truly so many powerful beings across the Myriad Realms? The Sun Corona, currently considered the pinnacle among the myriad races, was only ranked third? Could the South King and Fat Ball truly stand alongside the Sun Corona?

For a moment, Heavenly Fate was uncertain. Su Yu had named eleven formidable experts, and his side alone accounted for three of them! Of course, the myriad races might still have entities at the Sun Corona level, with possibly one each from the Immortal and Demon races, bringing the total to thirteen supreme beings!

The Eight-Winged Tiger pondered for a moment before speaking, "That Sun Devouring Divine Dog wasn't stronger than me before. Is the Su Emperor suggesting it has recently improved?"

Su Yu nodded. "Indeed, and thanks to your reminder, I realized its true nature, which led to its progress. Now, with those boots, it should be able to hold its own against you, perhaps even gaining a slight advantage!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger expressed envy, "Those boots are truly remarkable. With them, the Su Emperor's side has grown even stronger!"

He exchanged a few polite words, but dared not provoke Su Yu's side lightly. They were formidable!

Meanwhile, Marquis Destiny was deep in thought, hesitating for a long time before suddenly asking, "Emperor Yu, if I were to join your side, where would I rank?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Let me think..."

He, the South King, and Fat Ball were all slightly stronger than Destiny. As for the others, Giant Axe, March, and the pseudo-Heavenly Sovereign Tianhuo, as well as Lanshan...

After some contemplation, Su Yu replied, "Brother Destiny is not weak. Depending on the location, you might be on par with Senior March, just below a few of us. But in other places... it might be different. Tianhuo might be a bit stronger."

Tianhuo? Damn, another one?

Su Yu wasn't lying. When Tianhuo merged with his origin, he became a Heavenly Sovereign. Later, he integrated the fire dao into his own Great Dao, essentially mastering it. Although he hadn't reached the level of a ruler of laws, if he fought within his own world, Destiny might not be able to match him!

Destiny felt a bit helpless. So, as a Heavenly Sovereign, he might not even rank in the top five on Su Yu's side? He would have to compete with March?

Good heavens! When did Su Yu's side become this strong?

Beside him, Lantian chuckled softly, "Your Majesty, that's the current situation. I'm about to advance, and Heavenly Saint is close too! The Great Zhou King, though silent, seems to be nearing advancement as well... Once we reach the Heavenly Sovereign level, we might not be inferior to the veterans. The veterans have reached their limits, but we still have room to grow!"

He added, "And you forgot someone, the one walking the path of life and death!"

Su Yu smiled, "She's not here, so let's not mention her! If she were, I wouldn't even compare. There's no need to discuss it."

"......"

Destiny was speechless. Were they boasting? He couldn't tell! If they weren't, Su Yu's side was terrifyingly powerful! Even now, they were formidable! With March, Giant Axe, Su Yu, and Fat Ball, and if he joined, that would be five Heavenly Sovereign-level combatants, not to mention those who hadn't appeared yet!

After a moment, Destiny said solemnly, "The Fate Clan... still centers around Wuming. If Wuming were to pledge allegiance to Your Majesty... if Your Majesty has a way, I would like to meet Wuming. Then, I would naturally make my decision!"

Meeting Wuming would allow him to discern the truth!

Su Yu laughed, "Sure, within three days! Find an opportunity to go to the depths of chaos, avoiding others, and you can naturally meet Wuming!"

Alright then!
