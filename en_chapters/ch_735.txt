Chapter 735: Chaos vs. Torchbearers (Subscription Requested)

Chaos Mountain.

As the Myriad Race Council convened, behind the primitive forest of Chaos Mountain, lay the boundary between the outer and inner regions that Su Yu had previously explored. This forest was perilous, with a chaotic river running through it. At this moment, behind the forest, on a small mountain peak, figures moved back and forth.

At the summit, a massive cave had been excavated. Within the cave, powerful beings were engaged in rapid discussions.

"The Myriad Race Council has begun!"

"Without a doubt, this time they will reach a consensus to jointly target our race!"

"The Iron Devourer Race and the Fate Clan, among other strong races, have sent representatives. There will be no surprises..."

"The Myriad Races have yet to fully grasp our strength. Even if they deploy troops, they won't act rashly. Instead, they'll gradually clear Chaos Mountain, first securing the outer regions as a strategic base, using the chaotic forest as a boundary to confront us..."

Several powerful beings were gathered around a large sand table, continuously discussing strategies. On the sand table, various ancient city dojos were marked. The Dao Source Land in the extreme east, the central region of Ren Mountain, and the areas occupied by the three major races were all marked in red. The Dragon and Phoenix Dojos in the north, the Nether Clan Dojo near the west, and the Iron Devourer Race Dojo in the south were all clearly displayed.

Evidently, over countless years, the Control King's lineage had not been idle, nor had they ignored external affairs. The group exchanged information quickly, soon turning their attention to a solemn-faced middle-aged man who commanded respect in this place.

An elderly woman with graying hair coughed and spoke, "Yue Hao, the situation is clear. Now that the ancestor is overseeing the Sacred Clan, all external affairs fall under your responsibility. What do you think we should do?"

The next move of the Myriad Races was predictable, even with eyes closed.

The man referred to as Yue Hao spoke softly, "No rush, we need to consider another force!"

As he spoke, he conjured images in the air, "Currently, there's a third party, let's temporarily call them the Torchbearers, lurking in the shadows, waiting for chaos to erupt! This faction can temporarily merge with the lower realm, using it as a base to watch the tigers fight from the mountain!"

The others nodded.

Yue Hao continued softly, "If you were the Torchbearers, and the Myriad Races were about to attack Chaos Mountain, would you watch and wait, or intervene directly to control the situation?"

The group exchanged glances. The young woman who had earlier referred to Yue Luo as her aunt spoke softly, "Uncle Yue Hao, do you mean that when the Myriad Races deploy their troops, the Torchbearers might infiltrate them?"

"That's possible."

Yue Hao nodded slightly, smiling, "Anything is possible! Since we can plant spies within the Myriad Races, why can't the Torchbearers? The Human Race... even if our race split from them, we can't deny that the Human Race is inherently superior to the Myriad Races!"

He did not deny the strength, talent, and intelligence of the Human Race. In his eyes, the threat posed by the Human Race far exceeded that of the Myriad Races. Otherwise, the events of the past, where they dealt with the Hundred Battle King and ambushed over a hundred Daofuse Realm humans, would not have occurred. By undermining the Human Race's dominance, even if the Myriad Races claimed supremacy, it wouldn't be so straightforward.

Speaking of this, Yue Hao smiled, "I've also done some research on the Torchbearers. Whether it's ambushes, assassinations, or framing us, they do it flawlessly. Even if the Myriad Races hear rumors about us, their trust level is very low!"

"Of course, I believe that even if the Myriad Races don't say it, the three major races are somewhat prepared in their hearts!"

Yue Hao continued, smiling, "For now, let's not worry about the Torchbearers..."

He pointed to the Nether Clan territory near Chaos Mountain, a hint of killing intent in his eyes, "Yuxi, since the Torchbearers can frame us, let's muddy the waters completely! Make an example, take your people and annihilate the Nether Clan, leave no one alive!"

The young woman's expression changed slightly.

Yue Hao chuckled, "If the Torchbearers can impersonate us, then we can impersonate them. Whether the Myriad Races believe it or not, they need to know that besides our Sacred Clan, another lineage exists! This way, when they confront us, they won't dare to go all out, fearing someone else might take advantage, causing them to hesitate!"

That's enough!

When a great war erupts, if the Myriad Races fear a third party might exploit the situation, they won't commit everything!

"Take Zishui, Youzhen, and Dou Ke with you, set up the Deceptive Heaven Array, and while the old ghost of the Nether Clan is away, annihilate the Nether Clan!"

As his words fell, excitement flashed in the eyes of those in the cave.

Our clan is finally going to reveal its strength!

Annihilate the Nether Clan!

The young woman, Yuxi, took a deep breath, "Uncle Yue Hao, won't this make the Myriad Races more determined to fight us to the death?"

Yue Hao chuckled, "Yuxi, at this tide, since we've emerged, it means... it's time to end it!"

He sighed, "It's time to end it! For a hundred thousand years, our clan has accumulated enough. The constant consumption between the Myriad Races and the Human Race has exhausted the ancient foundations. The ancient times... have completely become the past! A fight to the death... is inevitable!"

"Unifying the Myriad Realms will still require some sacrifices!"

He sighed, smiled, and looked at Yuxi again, "Annihilate the Nether Clan, leave some traces, whether intentional or not, let the Myriad Races know it was the Torchbearers! Whether they believe it or not doesn't matter, what matters is that this lineage still exists!"

Yuxi nodded, "I understand."

After speaking, she looked at the three strong individuals in the cave, two men and one woman, including herself, four top-tier experts, all possessing quasi-king strength. Their power was formidable!

Or rather, everyone in the cave was a quasi-king!

This is the strength of the Sacred Clan!

Four quasi-king level experts would join forces to attack the Nether Clan, which had no Heavenly Sovereign overseeing it.

Yuxi glanced at the group and quickly said, "Uncle, I also need to mobilize 10 Daofuse Realm experts to jointly seal the Nether Clan's dojo, preventing anyone from escaping!"

"Granted!"

Yue Hao nodded, smiling, "Go, and return quickly! The Myriad Races might attack Chaos Mountain at any time, don't linger in battle, remember, strike decisively, and if you fail, retreat swiftly!"

He maintained a smile on his face, "The Myriad Races think we must hide in Chaos Mountain, waiting for them to kill us. No, they will never understand that the Human Race... is best at breaking conventions!"

Why wait for you?

Passive defense?

That's not the style of the Human Race. From ancient times to the present, the Human Race rarely engages in passive defense. Even though the Sacred Clan has split off, they do not deny their identity as part of the Human Race, only that they are a higher existence of the Human Race!

Yuxi nodded, smiling, "Then, Uncle, wait here for a moment, we'll be back soon!"

With that, she looked at the others, and their figures quickly vanished.

The three strong individuals also disappeared from the cave without a word.

Outside, 10 Daofuse Realm experts were mobilized, and in the blink of an eye, 14 strong individuals concealed their presence and vanished from the area.

The Deceptive Heaven Array, which the Great Ming King excelled at, was learned from Ziyan here.

And Ziyan was merely a member of the Control King's lineage, not even one who specialized in grand formations.

Among Yuxi's group, Youzhen was the most skilled in formations.

In Chaos Mountain, they carried portable Deceptive Heaven Arrays, effectively preventing rejection by the chaotic Great Dao.

The array was identical to the one Su Yu had discovered at Dao Origin Mountain, only more suitable for personal use.

After Yuxi and her group left, a few people remained in the cave.

The elderly woman spoke softly, "Yue Hao, what's the situation with the Hundred Battle King?"

"Him?"

Yue Hao raised an eyebrow slightly, then quickly smiled, "Yue Luo is luring him deeper into Chaos Mountain. For now, we don't need to worry about the Hundred Battle King. Even if Yue Luo can't take him down, she can restrain him, preventing him from interfering in other matters! Once he's deep enough in Chaos Mountain, it won't be easy for him to leave..."

The group nodded slightly, aware that the Hundred Battle King and Yue Luo had ventured deep into Chaos Mountain.

This way, the threat posed by the Hundred Battle King could be temporarily set aside.

Yue Hao chuckled softly, "I'm more concerned about who the Torchbearers might have infiltrated. If they've placed someone within the Myriad Races, it would be better to control the situation. The Iron Devourer Race, the Ancient Giant Race, or perhaps unexpectedly, the Fate Clan?"

Yue Hao smiled, quickly saying, "Gather the ancient beasts on the periphery as soon as possible, let them guard the outermost area, and let the Myriad Races attack! Exhaust their strength!"

"Yue Hao, if too many ancient beasts die, won't it cause disturbances at the Gate of Hell?"

An elder expressed concern, but Yue Hao replied softly, "No worries, the periphery is the periphery. The Gate of Hell... it's not ancient times anymore. The Gate of Hell has been reinforced by the Sacred King multiple times, so we don't need to worry for now!"

He didn't dwell on this, murmuring, "I'm more interested in where the Torchbearers' passage is! The Torchbearers must be using this passage to travel between the upper and lower realms. If we can find the passage and set up an ambush, we might have a chance to eliminate the strong individuals of this lineage!"

The group was also unclear. Although the Torchbearers had many people, they were personally left by the Human Emperor, and most had died in battle. Those who hadn't died were difficult to infiltrate with spies.

...

While the group was discussing, Yuxi led the three strong individuals and 10 Daofuse Realm experts across the chaotic forest.

Crossing the chaotic forest, they were somewhat excited.

The clan had decreed that to prevent the Myriad Races from discovering their existence, the chaotic forest served as a boundary. Without urgent matters or orders from the clan, crossing the chaotic forest was generally not allowed.

Of course, some had secretly ventured out, but they were very discreet, not daring to show themselves. Otherwise, if the clan found out, they would be punished.

At this moment, 14 individuals merged into the darkness, silent and undetected, even though a mountain not far away housed an ancient beast of the Daofuse Realm, which did not sense their presence.

"The Nether Clan..."

Yu Xi murmured softly, a smile gracing her lips as she transmitted her voice, "Everyone, this is our Sacred Race's first battle. Let's make it swift and show the myriad races our might!"

"Rest assured, my lord!" came the swift response from the group. In no time, they crossed over Chaos Mountain.

At this moment, the perimeter of Chaos Mountain was not deserted. Various races had stationed some powerful individuals around the mountain to monitor any movements. However, among this group, only two or three were at the Daofuse Realm, with dozens at the Eternal level, none daring to venture into Chaos Mountain, remaining on the outskirts instead.

"Shall we kill them?" asked Dou Ke, a burly man with a black-gold body, his eyes fierce. He licked his lips as he gazed below at those scattered around, monitoring Chaos Mountain, a hint of murderous intent in his eyes.

His killing intent was intense, having fought ancient beasts since childhood. The Control King's lineage had not engaged much with the myriad races' formidable foes, but they were not all about secluded cultivation. That was impossible. These individuals had also experienced countless slaughters. Top-tier experts had even ventured into the Gate of Hell to battle some of the most formidable ancient beasts, resulting in the emergence of so many strong individuals. The death rate was not low!

The Control King's lineage was not without ancient figures, all understanding a fundamental truth: stagnation would lead to eventual destruction. Only by continuously growing stronger and renewing their bloodline could the Sacred Race become a dominant force. In places unseen by the myriad races, they had slaughtered countless, with frequent deaths and injuries. They were not just a group of showpieces.

Yu Xi glanced around. At this moment, the people below had not noticed them, a faint membrane appearing around them, a deceptive formation laid by Zi Shui.

Seeing Dou Ke's boiling killing intent, Yu Xi sternly ordered, "Do not alert the enemy. These are just small fry. Don't disturb them. Head to the Nether Race! Everyone, follow orders here, or Uncle Yuehao and the ancestors won't spare those who disobey!"

Dou Ke's killing intent gradually subsided, a hint of fear in his demeanor, and he said no more.

Yu Xi paid him no mind, and soon, the group silently passed through the outer defenses.

After a while, they reached the Nether Race.

Seven massive arenas formed a large circle, connected end to end. Upon arrival, Yu Xi let out a low shout, forming a series of hand seals. Moments later, a small portal appeared on her forehead, causing others to look on with a mix of fear and envy.

It wasn't the Heaven Gate! But it was similar, a small portal resembling the Gate of Darkness, or more akin to the Gate of Hell!

"The Eye of Hell!"

Several experts exchanged glances but remained silent. This was the Eye of Hell! A top-tier dao technique that only the direct lineage of the clan could cultivate. Though slightly inferior to the legendary Heaven Gate, it was still an extremely powerful dao technique, capable of discerning truth from falsehood, probing fate, and restoring past and future events.

At this moment, the small portal on Yu Xi's forehead transformed into an eye, gazing at the seven arenas.

Her eyes emitted beams of light, some strong, some weak. Those were the radiances emitted by powerful individuals!

"How bold!" Yu Xi sneered after a quick scan, "The Nether Race is too bold, leaving only four Daofuse Realm experts, one top-tier Daofuse, and three lesser Daofuse, without even a single quasi-king!"

Do they really think no one dares to annihilate the Nether Race?

As she was about to give orders, she suddenly paused, looking in a different direction. It wasn't the Nether Race's territory but a small clan's arena belonging to the Shadow Clan, a clan not very powerful, with only two Daofuse Realm experts and two arenas.

At this moment, Yu Xi's eyes suddenly revealed two formidable beams of light. She quickly withdrew her gaze, a hint of surprise on her face, and soon chuckled, "Interesting! The Nether Race's experts are hiding in the Shadow Clan. Is this a precaution or an ambush for enemies?"

The Nether Race's experts were not staying in their own territory. Two quasi-king realm experts were hiding in the neighboring small clan, the Shadow Clan. If unnoticed, should anyone attack the Nether Race, thinking it unguarded, two Heavenly Kings could suddenly emerge, encircling them. Even if someone like Su Yu, with many experts, attacked, they could easily fall into a trap.

The others were also surprised, soon laughing, "The Eye of Hell is indeed powerful!"

Yu Xi shook her head, "It's just average. The truly powerful one is the Heaven Gate! The Heaven Gate can even observe the dao, while the Eye of Hell can only observe some fate, blood energy, and the power of laws."

The fundamental difference between the two was still significant.

She didn't dwell on it, quickly returning to the main topic, "Those two quasi-kings over there... they're not weak! Let's eliminate them first, then the Nether Race!"

With that, the group swiftly flew towards the distant Shadow Clan.

With the deceptive formation and the Eye of Hell, they were like a replica of Su Yu and his group. Moreover, their formation skills surpassed even those of the Great Ming King, making their deception even more effective.

Before long.

Above the Shadow Clan's arena, a formation was instantly laid down.

Within the formation, two top-tier experts of the Nether Race, along with a Daofuse Realm expert of the Shadow Clan, immediately sensed something amiss, soaring into the sky and erupting into battle!

Dou Ke and his group were immensely powerful, with fourteen experts besieging three. The opponents had no escape!

Outside, no one sensed anything unusual.

The formation laid by the Heavenly King himself was incomparable to the Great Ming King's formation.

Within the formation, Dou Ke's body erupted with chaotic power, his formidable physical strength surpassing that of ordinary physical dao experts. Wielding a giant axe, he struck, sending a Nether Race Heavenly King flying, blood spurting!

The two Nether Race Heavenly Kings roared in fury.

They had been cautious, fearing issues if they stayed in the Nether Race, yet problems arose anyway!

Damn it!

...

At the same time.

In Ren Mountain, within the grand hall.

The various races were still discussing how many troops to send, who would lead, and how much resources the less contributing races should provide to compensate those contributing more.

In the midst of the discussion.

Suddenly, the Nether Race's Heavenly Sovereign frowned, abruptly standing up and looking westward, his expression changing. Before anyone could ask, this expert, shrouded in nether energy, coldly stated, "It seems... something has happened!"

Everyone was surprised. There was no commotion, was there?

The Nether Race's Heavenly Sovereign's expression fluctuated, quickly looking at a massive ancient beast on the third floor, speaking in a deep voice, "Rift Sky, help me open a teleportation channel to the Nether Race's arena!"

The massive Space Ancient Beast, seeing his murderous aura and the other Heavenly Sovereigns looking over, said nothing, quickly beginning to tear through the void, locating the Nether Race's arena.

The Nether Race's Heavenly Sovereign's expression was grim. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth, "Ming Le is dead!"

At these words, everyone was shocked.

Ming Le was a quasi-king realm expert of the Nether Race.

"Origin Saint!"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign shouted, and beside him, the Origin Saint Marquis said nothing, quickly taking out a series of portals filled with energy, directly placing them into the rift opened by the Space Ancient Beast, speaking in a low tone, "Quickly locate it!"

The Space Ancient Beast, immensely powerful, dared not delay in the slightest.

Regardless of willingness, the Heavenly Sovereigns were all filled with murderous intent. How could he dare delay?

Moments later, about 20 seconds, the atmosphere in the grand hall was oppressively tense.

The Space Ancient Beast was also emitting white smoke, panting, "Almost there, the distance is a bit far... maintaining a stable space for Heavenly Sovereign-level teleportation requires a more stable space to prevent collapse during transit..."

He explained that he wasn't deliberately delaying but had to reinforce the space.

The Nether Race's Heavenly Sovereign said nothing, his expression growing increasingly grim!

The second Heavenly King had died!

His face was ashen. "Ming Tu has fallen!"

He spoke in a low tone, "Without any anomalies, it must have been concealed by a formation. The opponent knows I would sense it... I wonder if it's too late!"

No one spoke.

At this moment, the torn space channel quickly stabilized, and the portals thrown by the Origin Saint Marquis instantly opened.

Without a word, the Nether Race's Heavenly Sovereign immediately traversed through.

The other Heavenly Sovereigns exchanged glances, and the Desolate Heavenly Sovereign quickly followed.

The entire space channel was somewhat unstable.

Dao Heavenly Sovereign glanced around, speaking in a low tone, "Let's go, head to the Nether Race's arena! Notify the others to converge at the Nether Race's arena!"

The teleportation could only maintain the passage for two Heavenly Sovereigns.

But that was enough!

At this moment, Ren Mountain was no longer a place to stay. Everyone was eager to know what had happened.

Had the Chaos Race made a move?

Had they struck first?

Such boldness was not ordinary.

Moreover, the Nether Race had two quasi-king realm experts on guard. Even with preparations, as in the previous surprise attack on the Source of the Dao, it wasn't so simple to be killed. This time, if the Chaos Race acted, how many experts did they deploy?

Last time, three died. To swiftly kill two quasi-kings, the incoming quasi-kings must number four or five.

How strong was this race?

At this moment, even the Heavenly Sovereigns were somewhat solemn. Perhaps they had underestimated the opponent!

...

March also had a peculiar expression, transmitting to Su Yu, "This..."

Su Yu remained silent.

It has nothing to do with me!

My people are all in the Iron Devourer Race, so it seems the true Control King's lineage has made a move.

The Nether Race... well, being so close to Chaos Mountain, if the Control King's lineage acted, the Nether Race would be the first target. If not the Nether Race, then who? Last time, Su Yu was also prepared to deal with the Nether Race, only choosing the Dragon Race later.

No one spoke, and the Demon Heavenly Sovereign shouted, "Everyone, move together, get on!"

He tossed down a massive golden shuttle-shaped weapon, and all the demon experts flew onto it. Su Yu and the others exchanged glances, seeing the others boarding, and they too jumped on.

Once all the experts in the grand hall were aboard, the golden shuttle traversed the void at incredible speed!

In the blink of an eye, it crossed the Divine Race's territory, swiftly flying towards the Nether Race's area.

Though slower than spatial teleportation, it was much faster than ordinary Daofuse flight.

Carrying so many people and still maintaining such speed was truly astonishing. Su Yu silently took note of this. Whether it was the spatial teleportation gate from before or the current golden shuttle, he needed to remember these things and be cautious in the future. He hadn't encountered them before because he had caught the other side off guard. Now, the myriad races were also adapting to their blitzkrieg tactics.

As Su Yu pondered these matters, not far away, the white-haired Destiny Marquis strolled over. He approached March, sighing, "The calamity of the myriad races has descended! First the Dragon Race, then the Nether Race... The grudges of a hundred thousand years might all end in this era!"

March glanced at him and said with a simple smile, "Destiny Dao Brother, what have you seen?"

"Blood and fire!" Destiny Marquis sighed softly, "Disaster, catastrophe! The fall of countless powerful beings!"

"The Fate Clan is neutral anyway... At worst, we can just side with the Chaos Clan. Your clan always follows the strong."

These words were not spoken quietly. March, with his simple demeanor, said it loudly and directly. In the distance, several figures, including Mo Tianzun, looked over.

Destiny Marquis had a peculiar expression on his face but smiled, "March Dao Brother, you're joking. When calamity descends, who can avoid it? The Fate Clan observes destiny from above and connects with the underworld below! Regardless of who wins or loses, the Fate Clan... will likely face calamity too! The Fate Clan hopes for peace among the myriad races..."

March chuckled, "So, Destiny Dao Brother means to side with whoever is stronger? Maybe we, the myriad races, are stronger. Is Dao Brother planning to help the Chaos Clan?"

Destiny Marquis laughed, "March Dao Friend, that's not what I meant. The Chaos Clan is bloodthirsty by nature. The Dragon and Nether Races have suffered calamities one after another. How could my Fate Clan be an exception? However, apart from me, the strength of the Fate Clan is ordinary. The three major clans are not worried about calamity. Although you and I are strong, it's hard to avoid our clansmen being buried in this Chaos Mountain... I was just thinking that we should look out for each other. The Iron Devourer Race is good at defense and attack, while my clan excels in observing the path of destiny... Perhaps we should cooperate more in the future."

Their conversation was open and unguarded. Destiny Marquis was clear in his words. The three major clans were self-contained, difficult to integrate, and easily used as cannon fodder. The Fate Clan also had strong members who needed to participate in the war. Since that was the case, cooperating with the Iron Devourer Race would be safer.

In the distance, Mo Tianzun and the others said nothing. These guys forming small alliances was normal. At least it proved one thing: these clans were still willing to participate in the war. Survival was a common goal.

Over there, Thunderstorm of the Ancient Giant Race heard this and his eyes flashed with lightning, "The Giant Race can also cooperate more with the Fate Clan!"

The Fate Clan's ability to observe destiny increased the chances of survival. Cooperating with the Fate Clan, even if their strength was average, was actually quite worthwhile. Seeing Destiny Marquis directly approach March, he couldn't help but interject.

Our Giant Race can cooperate too!

Destiny Marquis smiled, nodded slightly, and then looked at Su Yu, speaking softly, "April Dao Friend, we may not participate in the battle immediately. When my Fate Clan arrives, I hope April Dao Friend will take care of us."

Su Yu chuckled, "Destiny Senior is too polite. I'm just following orders."

Inwardly, he felt strange. Why are you looking for me? The Fate Clan is mysterious; could they have seen through something? That shouldn't be possible! Su Yu was highly vigilant about himself. If anyone tried to spy on him, he would notice. Even for a strong member of the Fate Clan, seeing through him wouldn't be easy unless they were truly a master of the power of laws.

Destiny Marquis didn't say much more, just sighed, "The calamity of the myriad races has descended... I hope this attack on Chaos Mountain goes smoothly..."

With that, he drifted away. The others also withdrew their gazes.

The golden giant shuttle was incredibly fast, traversing the dangerous grounds and arenas below in an instant! Soon, the Nether Race's arena was faintly visible.

At this moment, on the Nether Race's side, a formidable presence shattered the void with a single strike. Instantly, the power of laws erupted, and fireworks bloomed in the sky! This was the sign of a Daofuse Realm expert's fall! Previously sealed within a grand formation, now that the formation was broken, everyone could sense the changes here.

In the arena of the Shadow Race, three fireworks rose, two of which were exceptionally brilliant! That marked the fall of two top-tier experts from the Nether Race, along with a Daofuse expert from the Shadow Race. Above the Nether Race, three fireworks ascended. A total of six powerful beings had fallen!

"Damn it!" At this moment, Nether Tianzun was filled with boundless rage. Of the seven arenas, the Nether Race had been slaughtered in four, leaving only one Daofuse expert, gravely injured and barely surviving, to hold onto three arenas. They had arrived quite quickly, yet those people still managed to escape.

Archaic Tianzun's power of the Great Dao erupted, causing the entire land to boil. Without a word, he sensed briefly and shouted, "Chase, they've entered Chaos Mountain!"

Nether Tianzun coldly gazed in the direction of Chaos Mountain, his face dark. A Nether River appeared, and the two swiftly pursued Chaos Mountain! The other side hadn't gone far! This time, they had teleported directly, arriving much faster than the other side had anticipated. Even if they fled, they wouldn't escape quickly.

In an instant, the two powerful beings tore through the void, chasing towards Chaos Mountain!

"They came really fast. I underestimated the myriad races!" At this moment, Yuxi and her group were all covered in blood, not their own, but that of the Nether Race's experts. Dou Ke panted, "They teleported directly from Ren Mountain... and there's still a Daofuse expert we didn't kill!"

Yuxi wasn't concerned about the remaining Daofuse expert but frowned, sensing two powerful auras rising behind them, rapidly closing in. With some helplessness and a frown, she said, "The mission wasn't completed perfectly... Forget it."

"Hurry up!" She urged, and everyone quickened their pace. As they felt the auras behind them getting closer, Yuxi dropped a jade talisman, sneered, and quickly left.

Not long after they left, two figures appeared in the sky, one above and one below, moving at incredible speed. Just as they arrived, a loud explosion erupted! A powerful aura burst forth!

Nether Tianzun and Archaic Tianzun stepped back a few paces. Nether Tianzun frowned, a trap? The explosion's power wasn't too strong! However, he quickly frowned slightly, looking up. In the sky, where the explosion had occurred, a vortex suddenly rose.

The next moment, ancient beast roars echoed from all around! Just as the two were about to pursue again, in the blink of an eye, the auras of three or four ancient beasts rose and charged towards them at incredible speed!

Nether Tianzun frowned immediately. Below, Archaic Tianzun cursed, "They stirred up the chaotic power here. Those guys have studied this place too deeply..."

As he spoke, four massive ancient beasts broke through the air. Some ran across the barren land, while others flew with wings that blotted out the sky, all possessing Daofuse auras.

"Intruders... kill!" The ancient beasts, possessing some intelligence, sensed the rejection of the chaotic Great Dao towards intruders. At this moment, they showed no mercy, swiftly attacking the two powerful beings. Even though the two had formidable auras, the beasts were fearless!

Ancient beasts had existed since the opening of the heavens!

Boom!

A fierce battle erupted instantly, and Nether Tianzun was furious. A Nether River appeared, instantly enveloping an ancient beast. The Nether River corroded the heavens and the earth, shattering the void. The beast enveloped by the river had its flesh and blood instantly shattered, turning to dust.

Below, Archaic Tianzun stomped down. A giant beast resembling a fierce tiger was about to leap when the ground trembled. With a loud boom, a powerful explosive force rose from the ground.

With a thud, the ground shook, and the giant tiger beast was torn apart!

In the blink of an eye, two of the four ancient beasts were killed! They were truly ferocious!

The remaining two ancient beasts were shocked, hurriedly letting out loud roars, calling for reinforcements from the surrounding ancient beasts.

Archaic Tianzun frowned, looking into the distance, "Nether Tianzun, we should retreat. There are many ancient beasts here. If we continue, we'll be surrounded... and then we'll have no choice but to fight now!"

Starting a battle now, the myriad races hadn't even fully explored the area.

Nether Tianzun's face was grim. He gritted his teeth, "Let's kill these ancient beasts before leaving!"

Archaic Tianzun nodded slightly, not refusing the request.

Together, their combined strength was formidable. In less than ten seconds, the four ancient beasts that had just arrived were all reduced to corpses.

At this moment, from the direction of the primeval forest, a loud roar shook the heavens and the earth, "Intruders, seeking death!"

A black light pierced through the heavens and the earth, directly penetrating the void.

Nether Tianzun stirred the Nether River, instantly shattering the black light. Coldly looking in that direction, he said coldly, "Ancient Beast Lineage... you've interfered with us. Don't think Chaos Mountain can protect you!"

With a cold snort and boundless anger, he quickly retreated with Archaic Tianzun.

As for the one who had just attacked, possessing quasi-king strength, there was still a significant gap compared to them. If they weren't unwilling to start a battle now, even if this quasi-king ancient beast came, it wouldn't matter.

However, with powerful ancient beast auras converging from all directions, the two still chose to retreat.

"Very strong!" At this moment, Yuxi and her group, retreating from the chaotic forest, all looked back, their expressions slightly solemn.

Very strong! Both were extremely powerful. Four Daofuse ancient beasts were killed in the blink of an eye!

Even Dou Ke was no longer arrogant, speaking seriously, "In our clan, there aren't many who can match them! Is this the Tianzun level?"

Yuxi said solemnly, "Let's go back first. These Tianzun-level experts are not our targets! Uncle Yuehao and the others will naturally handle them!"

The group quickly retreated.

At this moment, Su Yu and his group also arrived. The scene was one of devastation! Corpses were strewn everywhere, rivers of blood flowed. The previous surprise attack on the Dragon Race had been swallowed by Jiuyue, so the scene wasn't tragic. But today, the Nether Race truly had corpses strewn everywhere, rivers of blood flowing, a scene of utter desolation.

"Torchbearer!" Someone said solemnly, and in the void, several large characters appeared, floating in the air.

"Where the Torchbearer goes, not a single piece of armor remains!"

Su Yu frowned slightly. Shifting the blame? Was this saying the Torchbearer lineage did it?

This was my strategy, my method for dealing with enemies and others. Yet today, I find myself being framed. Even the existence of these few words seems extremely deliberate!

At this moment, Lantian also sent a voice transmission, "It seems like we're being scapegoated!"

March transmitted back, "Are you sure... it wasn't us?"

He was somewhat uncertain himself.

Su Yu remained silent. Nonsense, how could it be?

Even a fool would know there's no need to do such a thing.

However... you can't stop everyone from being cautious!

There were many people around at this moment, making it inconvenient for Su Yu to open the Heaven Gate. Otherwise, he would have really wanted to see how many people from the Control King's lineage had arrived.

Their strength was certainly not weak!

"Trying to pin this on me... nice try, quick move, but unfortunately... I'm not from the Torchbearer lineage!"

Su Yu grumbled inwardly.

Of course, regardless of whether it was true or not, this time, the various powerful figures would inevitably discuss the matter of the Torchbearer lineage.

Even if they knew it was the work of the Control King's lineage, they would still have to consider whether the Torchbearer lineage existed or not.

It couldn't be ignored!

Because according to some previous rumors, the earlier incidents weren't actually the work of the Chaos Race but rather a setup. In fact, various races were also pondering whether the Chaos Race needed to expose themselves so quickly.

Moreover, after rescuing the Hundred Battle King, he didn't attack the myriad races but went to seek revenge on Moon Luo.

On that day, Su Yu had deliberately mentioned Moon Luo, planting the seed for the Hundred Battle King to seek revenge on her. If it was truly the work of the Chaos lineage, why claim it was Moon Luo who sent people to rescue the Hundred Battle King?

Meanwhile, figures like Heavenly Venerable Mo were swiftly investigating the situation and clues.

Everyone was very serious.

The battle hadn't even started, yet two quasi-kings had already died. These people acted too quickly!

Their audacity was astonishing!

"Chaos, Torchbearer..."

"The Human Race truly is full of hidden talents!"

Several powerful figures exchanged thoughts. If it weren't for the internal strife within the Human Race, perhaps they really wouldn't be able to match them.
