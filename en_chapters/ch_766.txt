Chapter 766: The Beginning of the Path

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with the Martial Emperor.

At this moment, he was leading hundreds of powerful beings toward the Land of the Abyss.

...

Deep within the Land of the Abyss.

In the Sealed Grounds, black pillars of light stood tall, each now displaying a human face, carrying a grave expression.

"Is the Realm of Living Beings preparing to wage war against us again?"

Recently, the Land of the Abyss had been far from peaceful. After the North King and his followers retreated to this place, they initially kept to themselves. However, it wasn't long before the North King's subordinate, the Dragonblood Marquis, clashed with them.

Over the years, they had controlled many powerful undead in the Land of the Abyss, but soon found themselves in conflict with the Dragonblood Marquis, who acted with impunity. Although aware of their strength, he also knew they couldn't break the seal.

In recent days, the pressure had been relentless, with many powerful undead being slain. Moreover, strong beings from the Celestial River of Death had awakened, and instead of confronting them, the Four Kings' Domain had driven them toward the Land of the Abyss, even opening a passage for them.

The Land of the Abyss, which had been quiet for countless ages, was now embroiled in one battle after another.

Just a few days ago, the Abyssal Realm fell into this place. And today, dozens of Daofuse Realm experts, led by several Heavenly Kings, were advancing toward here.

They were all powerful beings from the Realm of Living Beings!

No... the Realm of the Dead also had many strong beings following, with the undead marquises joining in, bringing the number of Daofuse experts to over a hundred!

A terrifying number!

"Are we going to war?"

Someone murmured, while another sneered, "If war is to be waged, it should be against Ming Douhe and the others! We are sealed; killing us will only give rise to stronger beings!"

Besides, breaking the seal might not necessarily be a bad thing!

...

At the same time.

In the area where the North King and his group resided.

At this moment, a large number of powerful beings had gathered. Several of the North King's original undead marquises had perished, but recently, powerful undead had awakened from the Celestial River of Death, and new members had joined.

Including the Dragonblood Marquis, the North King now had over ten Daofuse experts under his command.

At this moment, the North King wore a solemn expression.

Not far away, the Dragonblood Marquis also frowned. So many powerful beings.

The Realm of Living Beings still had so many strong individuals?

"Dragonblood!"

The North King looked at the Dragonblood Marquis in the distance, his gaze deep. "What do you think we should do?"

Recently, the Dragonblood Marquis had been very active, and his strength had advanced rapidly.

Now, even the North King was somewhat unsure of this fellow's true strength.

After all, they hadn't yet crossed swords.

Dragonblood was still his great general!

However, he also sensed something unusual. Many of the Daofuse experts from the Celestial River of Death had been following the Dragonblood Marquis into battle, seemingly more obedient to him than to the North King.

This was not a good sign!

Of course, the North King didn't say anything about it at this time.

Because they were currently beset by internal and external troubles.

Internally, there were the powerful beings from the Sealed Grounds, and externally, the formidable beings from the Four Kings' Domain, both of whom were not to be trifled with.

The Dragonblood Marquis wore a grave expression. "My lord, are they here to deal with us?"

It's possible.

But perhaps we're overestimating them.

There are probably over a dozen Heavenly King-level beings, right?

A group of undead quickly gathered, all looking heavy-hearted.

What should they do?

Escape?

They had already fled to the Land of the Abyss; where else could they go?

If they didn't flee... were they just going to wait here to be slaughtered?

A group of undead gathered together, one of them angrily saying, "If it comes to it, we'll fight them!"

Fight?

How?

The North King and the Dragonblood Marquis couldn't be bothered to respond; they couldn't win.

And the Dragonblood Marquis, his eyes flickering, said, "My lord, how about we feign surrender?"

"Feign surrender?"

The North King looked at him, and the Dragonblood Marquis smiled faintly. "It seems to be that human, Su Yu. Doesn't he want to conquer the Realm of the Dead? Why don't we feign surrender... divert the trouble eastward, and lead them to the Sealed Grounds to see if they'll deal with Dizhi Luo and the others!"

Dizhi Luo's side was very strong.

Moreover, there was a Death Emperor there.

Even the Dragonblood Marquis was extremely wary of that one, who might have truly reached the level of a ruler of laws. Whether or not that was the case, it was hard to judge since the other was sealed, but many years ago, that one was already extremely powerful.

The North King didn't speak, because those hundreds of auras were already approaching the Land of the Abyss.

The North King quickly said, "Let's go, move away from them. It's best to avoid conflict and see if they are indeed targeting us!"

If they deviated a bit and the others still pursued, then today would not be easy.

The group of undead didn't say much, quickly following the North King in retreat.

And the Dragonblood Marquis, turning his head to glance at Su Yu's side, felt a vague sense of something drawing him toward them.

...

On Su Yu's side.

The South King sensed a large number of undead auras moving away and said in a deep voice, "Shall we take the opportunity to eliminate them?"

The North King was no longer worth mentioning!

Not because he wasn't strong enough, but because Su Yu's side had too many Heavenly Kings.

Now, dealing with the North King didn't require the same pressure as before.

Su Yu's side had ten times the power of the other.

Su Yu glanced over there, looked at the retreating North King, and smiled. "Forget it, if they're running, chasing them would take time. Today isn't the day to waste time!"

With that, he looked toward the pitch-black depths. "Let's go over there and take a look. I vaguely sense the presence of some powerful beings over there!"

Perhaps they were the sealed strong ones.

Let's see the situation first!

As Su Yu walked, he said, "Now, the South King is only a step away from becoming a Heavenly Sovereign, and Marquis Lanshan is also a step away from becoming a Heavenly King!"

"If we kill a few more Heavenly King-level experts, perhaps both of you can successfully advance!"

"Of course, there's no rush... If I can resurrect everyone, at the moment of resurrection, when the undead become living beings, perhaps their strength will increase."

The South King remained silent, but Marquis Lanshan was excited. "Your Majesty, can we really be resurrected?"

"It's hard to say."

Su Yu smiled. "Although I want to give you a definite answer, life and death are unpredictable. I haven't experienced true death myself. Perhaps only by understanding true death will I have the chance to resurrect you!"

Marquis Lanshan was a bit disappointed and said no more.

She was somewhat disheartened, as she still wanted to be among the living.

And Su Yu, no longer concerned with the Dragonblood Marquis and his group, found the situation over there quite interesting.

Many strong beings had awakened from the Celestial River of Death, but even with the addition of the original strong ones, they should have surpassed twenty Daofuse Realm experts by now. Yet, despite the battles, their numbers hadn't increased.

In this, the Dragonblood Marquis had played a significant role.

That's good!

Let him quietly clean up the mess.

Soon, Su Yu and his group crossed the territory previously held by the North King. This place was filled with wandering undead, but now they all trembled in fear, as Su Yu's side had many undead experts, exerting a suppressive force.

They continued forward.

Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, and at this moment, what appeared before him were more than a dozen massive pillars of light.

Su Yu's heart trembled!

And those pillars seemed to sense something as well. Even though they were sealed, at this moment, in the deepest part, a face appeared on a pillar of darkness, its gaze fixed on Su Yu!

Just like when Su Yu had probed the Heavenly Sovereign in the Land of Dao Source, at this moment, he saw a being possibly even stronger than a Heavenly Sovereign, a true ruler of laws!

Su Yu's original direction was slightly off from that side, but now he directly changed course, flying toward it.

As they approached, the South King and the others also vaguely sensed something.

...

Soon.

A place shrouded in a light curtain appeared.

On the periphery, chains sealed the heavens and the earth, sealing all directions.

Inside, more than a dozen black pillars of light stood.

At this moment, a face appeared on one of the pillars, the same face that had communicated with the North King before, Dizhi Luo.

Dizhi Luo glanced at the South King, recognizing her, and sneered, "Yu Ziqi, you've found a new master again?"

The South King coldly stared at him.

And Su Yu, after carefully surveying the area, counted them. There were quite a few, a total of fifteen pillars, and their strength was formidable.

Dizhi Luo was not among the strongest here.

Those who were sealed were not weak.

If they were too weak, why bother sealing them?

If they were insignificant, they would have been killed outright, saving time.

Fifteen strong beings, the weakest among them were probably at the Heavenly King level.

Dizhi Luo was among the weakest, with about ten Heavenly Kings judging by the pillars, while the other five pillars were slightly stronger, with four of them possibly possessing Heavenly Sovereign-level combat power.

The last one... Su Yu judged, might truly have the power of a ruler of laws!

Back then, they had indeed sealed many strong beings.

Su Yu pondered this, hearing Dizhi Luo's words, but didn't get angry. Through the seal, he smiled and asked, "What's your name?"

"Are you asking your grandfather?"

Dizhi Luo sneered, "Dizhi Luo! Little one, are you here with so many people to kill us? Come on, break this seal first, come in and kill me!"

Breaking the seal would be their chance to be unsealed.

"Dizhi Luo?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Alright, I'll remember you! It seems that back then, the Martial King and the others chose to seal you... was not the right decision. If it were me, I would have killed you all, until the strongest emerged... No matter how strong, can you be stronger than the Lord of the Undead? Such a waste of time, causing trouble for us juniors!"

Back then, those who didn't listen should have been killed!

I don't know what they were thinking, leaving behind so many strong beings.

There are really a lot!

Beyond expectations, Su Yu had previously thought there might only be a few.

Of course, it's still manageable; it seems there's only one ruler of laws.

Su Yu smiled, "The one in the deepest part, words can bring disaster, you know? Your subordinate here is too unruly! Provoking a scholar with a not-so-big heart is not a good thing!"

Dizhi Luo wanted to retort, hoping Su Yu would break in.

But at that moment, in the deepest part, a handsome face appeared on the pillar.

It carried a certain softness, the softness of the undead.

Almost indistinguishable from the living!

Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.

Nanyuan City, Great Xia Prefecture.

Su Yu stood amidst a vast expanse, his gaze fixed on the ethereal face that had appeared before him. Unlike the South Heavenly King and the others, whose features bore a hint of withered yellow, this visage was devoid of any such hue.

"Dizhi Luo," the face intoned, its voice neither harsh nor gentle. Dizhi Luo trembled slightly and quickly fell silent.

The face turned its attention to Su Yu, a faint smile playing on its lips. "So, you are the Human Lord of this generation, Su Yu?"

Su Yu chuckled. "You could say that."

Curiosity piqued, he asked, "Can you battle against the rulers of the laws?"

"Are you curious?" The face maintained its friendly demeanor, as if they were merely two friends engaged in casual conversation.

Su Yu nodded. "A bit. Between you and the Martial Emperor, who is stronger? That lunatic from earlier—I can't be bothered with him. Can you defeat him?"

The face smiled. "The Martial Emperor should be slightly stronger. Among the rulers of the laws, there are varying levels of strength. The Four Extremes Human King was at the top, followed by the likes of the Battle King. The Martial Emperor's strength was comparable to theirs back in the day... Of course, now he might not be as strong, given how much time has passed."

The Martial Emperor had once been a top-tier ruler of the laws. However, he had been sealed for hundreds of thousands of years. While others fought and progressed, he remained sealed, and the gap only widened.

Back then, the Culture King might have still been using the pen dao, but now he had long abandoned it. Similarly, the Human Emperor might have used other paths before eventually creating his own heaven.

So many years had passed, and Su Yu realized he might have overlooked some things. Indeed, one couldn't measure these powerful beings by outdated standards. Perhaps some of the current rulers of the laws were as strong as the Four Extremes Human King of old.

"What is your name?" Su Yu asked. The face smiled again. "Names are merely labels used in life. In death, people like to call me the Death Emperor."

Su Yu laughed. "Emperor... quite a title!"

"Where are you headed?" the Death Emperor inquired, glancing over the group. "Are you planning to venture deeper into the chaotic lands?"

He didn't think Su Yu would attack them. After all, they were still sealed, and breaking the seal wouldn't benefit Su Yu.

Su Yu nodded, smiling. "Yes, I'm heading that way. You're sharper than the Martial Emperor. Who has the time to bother him? By the way, are you lonely? If you are, I could call the Martial Emperor over to keep you company."

The Death Emperor chuckled. "Can you really call him over?"

Su Yu grinned. "Hard to say! But you might be the only ruler of the laws he could meet, both of you sealed. Wouldn't it be nice to have some camaraderie?"

Jokingly, Su Yu continued, "Fifteen strong individuals, quite a force! If you could gather other Daofuse Realm experts, you might even rival the Hundred Battle King, perhaps even surpass him... It seems I am indeed the weakest in this world!"

He then asked, "You've lived long and are strong. Let me ask, are you from the ancient era or the era of the heavens' opening?"

Su Yu was curious. "Did you experience the era when the Lord of the Dead opened the Death Path? Were you among the first batch of undead?"

The face remained impassive, silent, and unresponsive.

Su Yu laughed again. "It seems you don't want to talk about it! No matter, let me ask another question. You might know about the Ancient Giant Race, do you?"

The Death Emperor finally responded, his tone indifferent. "The Giant Race, you mean?"

He omitted the "ancient" part, as in his eyes, there was no such thing as ancient.

Su Yu nodded. "Yes, the Giant Race!"

"I know a bit," the Death Emperor replied with a light chuckle. "The Giant Race rose during the ancient era. Initially, they weren't very strong, but they grew increasingly powerful, dominating for a time. They were one of the top races of that period... though not very numerous."

"I heard they are descendants of the Human Ancestor, is that true?"

The Death Emperor paused before answering, "Perhaps. The Giant Race is called such because they resemble humans greatly, with only minor differences. The most significant difference is their enormous size, likely due to their formidable physical dao."

"Have you seen the Human Ancestor?"

Nearby, hundreds of people, including Dizhi Luo, were speechless.

Are they really having a chat?

Speechless!

The Death Emperor thought for a moment, then said softly, "I once saw him from afar, but he was a supreme being, and I... was merely an observer."

Su Yu was shocked. "You really saw him? So, you are indeed quite ancient! Do you know how the era of the heavens' opening ended? Was it the work of the Human Ancestor?"

"Or was it the Lord of the Dead?"

The two were likely from the same era.

The Death Emperor chuckled. "As I said, I was just an observer, a weakling. How could I know such things? You overestimate me!"

"True, those who weren't weak wouldn't have been killed and become undead."

"......"

Beside him, the South King and the other undead glanced at Su Yu. Was he insulting them?

Did they die because they were weak?

Su Yu cleared his throat, not continuing the topic. Instead, he asked with a smile, "You're probably like the Martial Emperor. Once the Upper Realm opens and the power of the realm disperses, the rules fluctuate, and you might be unsealed, right?"

"More or less."

Su Yu continued, "Can I ask about your plans?"

With a sincere smile, Su Yu asked, "Will you join me and recognize me as your lord, or will you, after being unsealed, compete with me for control of the Death Realm?"

This time, before the Death Emperor could speak, Dizhi Luo angrily retorted, "Ridiculous! You think you're worthy? Once we're unsealed, it will be your end!"

Su Yu laughed, glancing at Dizhi Luo, then at the Death Emperor. "This guy is too reckless! Some like brutes, some don't. If it's your own brute, you have no choice but to tolerate it... but someone else's brute is just annoying! Moreover, he has a foul mouth! Death Emperor, if you want to join me, find an opportunity to kill him and use his death mark as a token of allegiance. I might consider accepting you!"

Silence.

This was the first time the Death Emperor had interacted with Su Yu, and he immediately felt Su Yu's cunning and dominance.

Arrogant fellow!

Is it because we haven't been unsealed yet?

As they spoke, Su Yu stepped forward, suddenly touching the chains. Instantly, a powerful force swept over him!

Su Yu carefully sensed it, then stepped back with a smile. "Interesting, this doesn't seem like a seal set by the Control King. It resembles the Culture King's... but not quite. Who set this?"

"The Radiant King," the Death Emperor replied softly. "The Radiant King set up this binding array."

Su Yu nodded. "I see! So it was the Radiant King."

He then asked, "By the way, above you is the Human Realm, right?"

"Probably," the Death Emperor replied softly. "We've never opened it. Would you like to try?"

Su Yu laughed. "Maybe someday, if I get the chance! Oh, by the way, the Human Realm will soon have strong individuals, perhaps as strong as you. If I get the chance, I'll lock him in here to keep you company."

Su Yu sighed. "What a troublesome era. Everything seems to be emerging in this era! You've been sealed for so many years, and it seems this era is about to unseal... The Martial Emperor is also being unsealed, and the Control King's descendants are emerging... Rising in this era, I am indeed... fortunate!"

Su Yu laughed heartily. "Alright, that's enough chatting for today! I'll come back to see you sometime. Maybe I won't need the Upper Realm to unseal you. I'll find an opportunity to help you unseal!"

Dizhi Luo sneered. "You?"

Su Yu laughed. "Once you're unsealed, I'll kill this guy first. I hope the Emperor won't mind! I'm not one to hold grudges; I usually settle them immediately! I've remembered the name Dizhi Luo, quite rare!"

After all, he couldn't kill him now.

"Everyone, see you later!"

Su Yu chuckled as he led his group away, the hundreds of strong individuals around him remaining silent.

Of course, some glanced indifferently at Dizhi Luo.

He's doomed!

Dizhi Luo felt uncomfortable under their gazes!

After the group left, he sneered. "A bunch of cowards! Emperor, why bother with him?"

In the depths, the Death Emperor glanced at him and said softly, "Why bother? He managed to make hundreds of strong individuals submit, even Yu Ziqi was willing to submit... Why make an enemy of him before we're even unsealed?"

With a sigh, the face disappeared.

Why bother!

If someone can subdue so many strong individuals, how could they not have some real skills?

Before being unsealed, there was no conflict. Dizhi Luo's words had made an enemy of the other party. Once unsealed... are you sure you can match him?

He was setting himself up as a strong enemy.

Dizhi Luo frowned slightly, then quickly sneered, not taking it to heart.

Once unsealed, would he fear him?

...

Ahead.

The South King frowned. "I didn't expect the Death Emperor to still be alive. I thought he had long perished."

Su Yu smiled. "It doesn't matter. There are quite a few sealed strong individuals. Besides him, there are probably four Heavenly Sovereign-level experts! They weren't killed back then, probably fearing that killing them would give rise to a Martial Emperor-level, or even stronger, Four Extremes Human King-level expert."

From what he could see, there was a significant difference in strength among the rulers of the laws.

However, early sealing wasn't a big issue. What puzzled Su Yu was why they weren't dealt with later.

Su Yu shook his head. "Back then, after the conquest, they didn't kill them, but why didn't they eliminate these beings in the later years? Even if a Human King of the Four Extremes level emerged, they could have just killed them if they disobeyed. It's not like they couldn't be killed!"

"If they kept killing, I don't believe they wouldn't eventually provoke the Lord of the Dead Spirits..."

As he spoke, Su Yu paused slightly. Perhaps... this was indeed what the Human Emperor and the others were concerned about. If they continued killing, perhaps the death of all these powerful beings would eventually give rise to an incredibly formidable existence.

The Lord of the Dead Spirits?

Shaking his head, he decided not to dwell on it. Su Yu continued to venture deeper, gradually sensing the aura of chaos. Indeed, in the depths, there were still areas of uncharted chaos.

...

Chaos seemed to be isolated by the Land of the Abyss. On one side was dense death energy, and on the other was the power of chaos. This was very similar to Chaos Mountain, where one side was source qi and the other was chaotic power.

When Su Yu and his group reached the deepest part, they saw two distinct worlds. There seemed to be a faint barrier between them.

At this moment, everyone was solemn. Wan Tiansheng spoke in a deep voice, "Should we open it here? If we open it here, the experts of the Death Realm might sense it and know about it. Could this cause trouble?"

Su Yu didn't respond immediately. He flew forward for a while and then reached out towards the chaotic region. As his hand extended, he quickly felt the familiar power of chaos.

Frowning slightly, Su Yu said in a deep voice, "The danger of opening a path doesn't need much explanation. I'm worried about one thing!"

Everyone looked at him.

Su Yu gazed into the depths of chaos. "I'm wondering if there are ancient beasts here?"

At these words, those who had been to the Upper Realm frowned slightly.

Ancient beasts!

Ancient beasts lived in chaos and rarely crossed boundaries. It was unclear whether they were restricted or for some other reason. Even powerful beings like the Desolate Beast had to transform the Chaos Dao into a physical path when entering the Myriad Realms. Perhaps they were repelled!

The Myriad Realms had the Time Dao, the Upper Realm had the Human Emperor's Dao, and the Death Realm had the Death Dao. Perhaps, if ancient beasts entered, they would be suppressed. Thus, ancient beasts were not seen in the Death Realm.

However, if a path was opened in chaos, would it attract ancient beasts?

Ancient beasts were not bound by realm restrictions. Those who had lived long enough could become powerful beings at the level of the rulers of laws.

Wan Tiansheng frowned. "It's indeed possible! I'm even considering whether chaos is interconnected. Could the chaos here connect to the endless void of the Myriad Realms or the depths of Chaos Mountain?"

"If they are connected... that would be troublesome. Even if there aren't any here, there are plenty of ancient beasts in Chaos Mountain."

Su Yu nodded slightly and soon smiled. "It's not a big deal. This is the boundary between realms. At worst, we retreat to the Death Realm. Ancient beasts generally won't come out."

No one spoke.

That's what they said, but if Su Yu were to open a path in chaos and a powerful ancient beast appeared, what would Su Yu do?

Taking a deep breath, Su Yu realized there was no turning back at this point. If he didn't open a path, with his current strength, how could he talk about contending for supremacy? How could he compete with others?

Opening a path was a necessity.

"Wan Prefect, keep an eye out... If an ancient beast appears, anything below the level of a ruler of laws can be dealt with. But if a ruler of laws appears, then retreat to the Land of the Abyss!"

Even if a Heavenly Sovereign appeared, it would be a death sentence. The fear was that more than just a Heavenly Sovereign would come.

In chaos, time was meaningless. Who knew if some ancient giant beasts were lurking in the shadows?

...

Su Yu wasted no more time and took a step out of the Land of the Abyss. He emerged from the death energy and stepped into chaos.

Su Yu continued forward. Being too close to the Land of the Abyss wasn't ideal. Going deeper would prevent anyone from accidentally stumbling upon him and disrupting his path-opening.

Behind him, Wan Tiansheng and the others were about to follow when Su Yu turned back and said, "No need to follow. Just observe from a distance! Too many people will make the aura of myriad paths too dense, which isn't good!"

However, Lantian ignored him and followed directly, with a faint aura of chaos emanating from him. Fat Ball, wagging its tail beside a little girl, said, "Tea Plant, you go too!"

Tea Plant looked back, and Fat Ball transmitted, "You go. You're considered part of the Chaos Race. If there really are ancient beasts, maybe you can chat with them and avoid a fight!"

Tea Plant was puzzled. Could that work? Well, if Fat Ball said so, I'll believe it.

Tea Plant quickly followed, and unlike the others who felt oppressed, Tea Plant seemed to enjoy itself, rolling around in chaos and quickly catching up to Su Yu, giggling with apparent delight.

Su Yu glanced back but said nothing.

Tea Plant indeed walked the path of chaos, which explained why it could swim in the River of Time.

They continued forward, traveling several tens of thousands of meters. Looking back, the boundary was visible, and Wan Tiansheng and the others were silently watching from afar.

This distance seemed about right. Any further, and they might not be able to clearly observe the process of opening a path.

Beside him, Lantian chuckled, "You open the path, and Tea Plant and I will protect you. We can easily handle ordinary ancient beasts."

Protecting the path!

When he opened his path, his protectors were Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng. Now that Su Yu was opening his path, he had to be there to protect it, no matter what.

Tea Plant played behind them, rolling around and enjoying itself.

Hearing Lantian's words, it giggled, "Lantian, will there be ancient beasts coming to fight?"

Lantian chuckled eerily, "Who knows."

There was a possibility.

He pulled Tea Plant along and quickly disappeared from the original spot, moving ahead of Su Yu just in case.

Su Yu said nothing.

At this point, there was no need for pretenses.

A book appeared, the Mark of Civilization. Soon, another book also appeared faintly, the Book of Time. Then, the Starry Sky Seal and the Human Lord Seal appeared one after another, floating around Su Yu.

This time, he might need to use them all.

The Mark of Civilization opened, and pages flipped rapidly. From the River of Time, Su Yu retrieved the pages of the Great Dao, which had been nurtured for only a few months!

A total of 3,000 pages!

Some were strong, like the Demon Race page, with its shadow possessing the power of a third-tier Daofuse. Others were weak, like the Fire Pig page, with its shadow barely possessing Skysoar power.

Too weak!

The imbalance of power was also a problem, but Su Yu had some plans.

The power of the Book of Time was actually more balanced than Su Yu's Mark of Civilization. This was due to the accumulation of time. Su Yu's accumulation was too short, even though he had nurtured them in the Great Dao for only a few months.

Taking these out wasn't enough. A large number of treasures, source qi, Sunmoon Profound Yellow Liquid, and others were placed aside by Su Yu.

One by one, divine characters leaped out from the sea of will, merging into the corresponding pages.

At this moment, the Mark of Civilization appeared particularly sacred and mysterious.

Su Yu's energy, spirit, and essence began to erupt, brewing to reach their peak!

...

Behind them.

Wan Tiansheng and the Heavenly Kings were all worried. The Great Zhou King also frowned and transmitted, "He's not fully prepared yet. The time is too short! Give him a few more decades, and he might open the heavens smoothly. But now... it's too soon!"

Su Yu was a prodigy, an unparalleled prodigy. But it was really too soon. His understanding of the Great Dao wasn't deep enough, and his nurturing of the myriad paths had only just begun. In this situation, Su Yu choosing to open the heavens was unimaginably risky!

Wan Tiansheng sighed and transmitted, "There's no choice! Time is pressing. The Upper Realm has erupted into war, and here in the Lower Realm, Hundred Battle has returned! Even if he walks the pen dao, it's hard to reach the Heavenly Sovereign level in a short time! As for the Human Emperor's Dao you mentioned... that was opened by the Human Emperor. If the Human Emperor returns, what then?"

The Human Emperor wasn't dead!

This was the path opened by the Human Emperor, the core path, unlike the pen dao, which could be abandoned.

When the Human Emperor returns, will you yield the path or not?

If you yield... then what will Su Yu cultivate?

If not, taking over a path half-opened by the Human Emperor is also a problem.

Now, rulers of laws have appeared, and there's no time for Su Yu to slowly cultivate.

The Great Zhou King remained silent.

If Su Yu's ambition wasn't so great, even if he returned the path to the Human Emperor, Su Yu could still cultivate by relying on the Human Emperor's Dao, becoming a powerful being with the strength of a ruler of laws.

After all, both the physical path and the Death Dao could give birth to beings with the strength of a ruler of laws.

The Human Emperor's Dao would be no exception!

But... would Su Yu be content?

Perhaps Su Yu didn't inherit the Human Emperor's Dao for this reason. If the Human Emperor were dead, Su Yu might have inherited it. The key was that the Human Emperor wasn't dead; he was still alive!

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath and said no more.

Everyone looked towards Su Yu in the distance. At this moment, the only thing they could do was pray for everything to go smoothly. As for those like Heavendoom, who blindly trusted Su Yu, there was nothing they could do.

In the distance, Su Yu's aura gradually rose, becoming increasingly powerful!

Clearly only at the Sunmoon Realm, at this moment, it seemed that even Daofuse might not be able to match him!

At this time, no one opened the Heaven Gate. Otherwise, they would see in front of Su Yu, on the Mark of Civilization, thousands of Great Dao powers faintly appearing, all virtual daos, not the power of the Great Dao from the River of Time.

Chaos began to tremble.

The power of chaos was repelling these Great Dao powers, and the pages of the book began to move without wind.

"Settle!"

A soft command echoed, and two seals fell into the void, suppressing the somewhat turbulent power of chaos.

The opening of the heavens was about to officially begin.

Everyone watched with bated breath, their eyes filled with complexity.

Would he succeed?
