Chapter 754: Reunion (Subscription Requested)

To stay or to leave? Who will go, and who will remain? Should one choose the Hundred Battle King, or should one choose Su Yu?

On one side is a top-tier powerhouse comparable to the ancient Human Emperor, with some ancient marquises following him. On the other side is Su Yu, who has just suffered a crushing defeat, exhausted his resources, and is preparing to retreat to the Death Realm.

Both are peerless geniuses, both are leaders of their generation. The Hundred Battle King is somewhat known; perhaps the foreign races fear him, but it is said that he treats the Human Race well. Of course, six thousand years ago, the Hundred Battle King was also defeated once. But now, hasn't Su Yu also been defeated?

In the grand hall, no one had left yet. Everyone was communicating through voice transmission.

"Old Liu, what do you think?" someone asked the Great Han King.

The Great Ming King and others were gone—whether they were dead or, as Su Yu claimed, their sea of will still existed but was hiding somewhere, was hard to determine. Zhu Tiandao and Marquis Xia Hou remained calm, believing that perhaps they were still alive. But... who knew if they were just putting on a show with Su Yu? Su Yu had no reason to fake such a crushing defeat, right? The Human Realm was about to be abandoned!

Previously, there were 43 Eternals in the Human Realm, including 26 prefects. The rest, like Xia Longwu, were late-stage advancements. Not counting Marquis Xia Hou and Zhu Tiandao, there were 45 Eternals in total. Now, with the Great Zhou King and four others gone, along with Xia Longwu, Yun Chen, Nan Wujian, the Extermination King, and Zhou Tianyuan, nine more powerhouses were lost, leaving 36. However, recently, a few had advanced, bringing the number of Eternals in the Human Race back to 40. Four had advanced in these few months, which wasn't too few, and with Zhu Tiandao and others, six had advanced in total.

Forty Eternals! None had stepped into the Daofuse Realm. Many turned their gaze to the Great Han King, the Great Tang King, and the Great Shang King. After the disappearance of the Great Ming King and others, these were the strongest, all nearing the Daofuse Realm. Additionally, the newly advanced Heavenly Casting King, due to forging many weapons, was also nearing the Daofuse Realm.

At this moment, everyone's gaze was fixed on them. How should they choose? And what about the foreign races, how should they choose?

The Space Beast Emperor looked at June, who remained silent, sitting still as if turned to stone. Others looked at the few Daofuse Realm experts in the Human Race, like Tian Yue and Chongming, left behind by the Marquis of Dingjun. The Marquis of Dingjun seemed to have perished as well. So, what path would Chongming take? Tian Yue wasn't even from this tide of the Human Race, what about him?

Duobao, from the foreign races, had previously joined Su Yu due to his overwhelming power. But now, with Su Yu preparing to retreat, what about Duobao? The Guardians would likely follow Hongmeng. Would Hongmeng follow them?

Thoughts flickered through everyone's minds. The Death Realm was not suitable for living beings. No matter how Su Yu managed, it wasn't a long-term solution. Moreover, it seemed Su Yu's life was nearing its end.

At this time, Zhu Tiandao stood up, smiling lightly, "Everyone, there's no need to overthink. Leave if you wish, stay if you wish! Everyone has their own choice, and no one will force anyone to die!"

"Guarding the Human Realm for hundreds of years, it's normal to feel reluctant to give it up! Whoever becomes the Human Lord might not make a difference to us!"

The Great Tang King looked at him and suddenly asked, "Is your father truly dead?"

Zhu Tiandao shook his head, "Not too sure. Something happened in the Upper Realm. My father and I don't cultivate the same path, so I might not sense it. Unless we cultivate the same path and have a bloodline connection, maybe I could sense it. But now... it's hard to say! The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King have changed their bloodlines, and I see that Xia Xiao'er doesn't feel anything!"

Marquis Xia Hou was speechless for a moment before nodding, "I haven't felt anything."

Zhu Tiandao continued, "To be honest, even if they're alive, the result is still the same. If Emperor Yu wasn't defeated by the Upper Realm, wasn't defeated by the Hundred Battle King, he wouldn't choose to retreat. Who would give up the newly conquered territory? Perhaps this departure... is a one-way trip!"

"Everyone should think it over. Xia Xiao'er, come with me to inventory the supplies. Also, spread the news, recall all the armies, and inform the troops. Those willing to leave can leave, those unwilling, we'll arrange for them to stay and guard!"

Zhu Tiandao said calmly, "The Hundred Battle King may be ruthless, but we cannot be unrighteous. After all, it's all for the Human Race! Handing over a complete Human Race to him won't cause turmoil! Keeping the governing structure intact will allow him to take over smoothly, otherwise, it will be hard on everyone!"

Marquis Xia Hou nodded, and the two left instantly.

In the grand hall, the Hou Pseudo Emperor sighed, "I have no way out. My race is not like yours... Well, going to the Death Realm is better than staying here. The Hundred Battle King... no matter how strong he is, he's not our reliance!"

He left to prepare for the retreat, abandoning the Hou Realm. The Hou Race wasn't strong in the Upper Realm. He had helped in battles several times. The Iron Devourer Race had March and the Marquis of Giant Bamboo, the Space Race had the Marquis of Cracking Space, the Fate Clan had the Marquis of Destiny. What did he have? He had nothing. Staying was useless.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor broke through the air, taking several Eternals of the Hou Race with him, having no other choice.

At this moment, Chongming also stood up. He had previously brought back over a thousand subordinates of the Marquis of Dingjun, including many Eternals. Now, he needed to go over there and see.

Tian Yue saw him rise and quickly followed, transmitting, "Chongming, are you... going to stay?"

The Marquis of Dingjun had perished. The Marquis of Dingjun had been a supporter of the Hundred Battle King in the last tide. If Chongming stayed, it would be a good choice. Moreover, Chongming had some strong subordinates in the Dingjun Guard.

Chongming walked and said, "I don't know. I'll ask everyone's opinion! The Marquis is gone... I'll ask everyone what to do next! If they think we should continue to follow Emperor Yu, I'll continue to follow. If they think we should stay and wait for the Hundred Battle King... then we'll stay!"

He asked, "Tian Yue, what about you?"

"Me?" Tian Yue said softly, "I'll follow Emperor Yu. I'm from the Culture King's lineage. The Hunting Heaven Pavilion was originally the Heaven Monitoring Pavilion. Now, the Culture King's lineage is with Emperor Yu, so naturally, I'll follow."

Chongming nodded, feeling a bit distressed and despondent, "You say... how did it come to this? Did the Marquis really perish? We just saw hope... and it quickly turned to despair!"

He was filled with indescribable helplessness and sorrow.

Tian Yue was also speechless for a moment. He didn't know why it suddenly turned out like this.

...

That day, the news began to spread in the Human Realm. The invincible Emperor Yu, who had taken many powerhouses to the Upper Realm, was defeated there, suffering heavy losses. Now, the ninth-generation Human Lord, the Hundred Battle King, was about to return. Emperor Yu chose to retreat, planning to withdraw to the Death Realm, intending to rise again. He and the Hundred Battle King were destined not to cooperate or work together. Su Yu had scorned the Hundred Battle King more than once, something many were aware of.

Now, some ancient marquises were still alive, choosing to support the Hundred Battle King's restoration. Su Yu's strength was greatly diminished, his lifespan short, choosing to withdraw from the Human Realm and relinquish his territory, causing a massive uproar!

...

Great Ming Prefecture.

The streets were bustling, and a storyteller was spreading the news, speaking with excitement, "Everyone, the Prefect has ordered that those willing to follow Emperor Yu should gather at Starfall Mountain within ten days! Leaving home... alas, this might mean never returning to our homeland!"

"I heard the Hundred Battle King treats the Human Race fairly well. But who knows if he'll treat us kindly upon his return."

"Going to the Death Realm... I heard it's like the underworld, no sunlight, let alone enjoyment. Even food and drink are a problem. I heard that over there, you can only eat corpses and rotten meat..."

"Really?"

"Truly!"

"My neighbor's neighbor, Old Wang's son, serves in the army. I heard they had contact with the undead last time... my heavens, they drink blood and eat rotten meat..."

"That bad?"

"That bad!"

"How did Emperor Yu get defeated? Alas, now we've lost the Myriad Realms... We had just conquered the Myriad Realms, and I was thinking of taking my wife to travel the realms, but now it's gone?"

"Do you think this new Hundred Battle King is as powerful as Emperor Yu? I heard he was also defeated thousands of years ago, losing many powerhouses..."

"......"

The discussions were endless.

To stay or to leave, this question sparked heated debates throughout the Human Realm.

People were unfamiliar with the Hundred Battle King. They were somewhat familiar with Su Yu, at least knowing that this new Human Lord had led them to the pinnacle of their lives, with the Myriad Realms submitting!

Of course, now he was defeated.

The Death Realm... if it were in the Human Realm, people would still support Su Yu. After all, even in defeat, Su Yu still had the people's hearts. The main issue was the unfamiliarity with the Hundred Battle King.

But going to the Death Realm, truly a separation of life and death, made countless people reconsider.

This... was not something they could follow!

In the civilian world, the military, various academies, and families, discussions, deliberations, and decisions were being made.

Meanwhile, Zhu Tiandao and others were quickly gathering all resources, leaving behind food and basic supplies, but not sparing any secret realms or high-level resources they had just plundered for the Hundred Battle King.

The Hundred Battle King couldn't have nothing. Over the years, although he was sealed, he wasn't without subordinates.

...

The entire Human Realm was in turmoil.

But Su Yu had no time to worry about these matters.

At this moment, he led a small group to the Abyssal Realm, consisting of himself, Hongmeng, Fat Ball, the Fate Emperor, and Marquis Tongtian.

The Fate Emperor stepped into this realm, feeling nostalgic, "Back then, the Abyssal Race's betrayal was much like the current Human Race. It wasn't really a betrayal, just a difference in ideology that led us to part ways!"

It was very similar to the current situation with the Human Race.

Su Yu, somewhat like the Abyssal Race of old, was leading some people to retreat into the Death Realm.

Su Yu chuckled, "I don't want to become like the Abyssal Race!"

He looked around, seeing the devastation. Not only had the Great Zhou King and others bombarded this place, but there had also been a massive influx of undead, triggering a rules punishment that swept through the entire Abyssal Realm.

The race was truly exterminated!

In the vast Abyssal Realm, there was not a hint of life; only ruins and desolation stretched as far as the eye could see. From the distant depths, a faint aura of death seemed to seep through.

The Fate Emperor gazed into the distance. "Find the core of the Abyssal Realm and merge it into the Death Realm. It will be like creating a small realm within the Death Realm, similar to the Myriad Realms."

Su Yu nodded. The Myriad Realms were formed this way; initially, there were no small realms until someone created them, leading to the existence of the Myriad Realms.

"Creating a realm isn't difficult," Su Yu agreed. "As long as one possesses Daofuse Realm strength, they can open a realm. The strength of the realm varies, though. The Abyssal Realm is quite strong, so we don't need to create it ourselves. The key is how to prevent the invasion of death aura after merging."

That was the real challenge!

The Fate Emperor chuckled. "For that... we'll need the Petrification Art! Back in the day, King Gong's Petrification Art was quite effective at blocking death aura. Just look at those guardians; they haven't been invaded for a hundred thousand years..."

Su Yu was slightly taken aback. The Petrification Art!

Right!

Moreover, I seem to have mastered the art from someone skilled in it—Qi Rong!

A pseudo-king, yet still a king!

It doesn't need to last a hundred thousand years; a few hundred years should suffice, right? If not, then a few decades?

"Petrify the entire realm from the outside..."

Su Yu murmured, but the Fate Emperor shook his head. "No need. Just petrify the weaker points. The Abyssal Realm isn't weak; its barriers can resist. Not every part will be permeated by death aura."

Su Yu nodded. However, if the entire realm could be petrified, that would be ideal!

Qi Rong!

Su Yu wasn't adept at the Petrification Art, but thinking of this, he immediately summoned Qi Rong.

The Fate Emperor's mouth twitched!

Damn you!

Didn't you say your subordinates were all defeated?

This... this is a king, isn't it?

Damn liar!

Su Yu explained, "I picked her up along the way. Do you know Lady Qi Rong?"

"Lady Qi Rong?"

Wuming was slightly stunned, looking at the now more vibrant Qi Rong, vaguely recognizing some past traces, surprised. "Lady Qi Rong... still alive?"

"Wuming?"

Qi Rong also saw Wuming, surprised, and glanced around curiously. "This is..."

"The Abyssal Realm!" Su Yu laughed. "I was defeated in the Upper Realm and am considering taking the Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm to escape! But I'm worried about the death aura invading the Abyssal Realm. Lady Qi Rong, you're skilled in the Petrification Art. How does it compare to King Gong's?"

Qi Rong was filled with questions but didn't ask. She quickly replied, "To put it simply, it's the difference between true and false. If King Gong were here, I could devour him!"

"......"

Wuming's mouth twitched again. That sounded... so awkward!

Qi Rong ignored this, looked around, and then at the depths, nodding. "I can petrify it, but I'm not a master of laws. I can't resist for too long! After three to five hundred years, it must be reinforced!"

Su Yu smiled. "Then there's no problem!"

Lady Qi Rong, this bone I picked up, is still useful!

The Petrification Art seems quite impressive.

"Then let's find a way to sink this place into the Death Realm! Merge it, seal the exit, and move the thirty-six cities here to rebuild..."

As he spoke, Su Yu added, "I forgot to mention, if this place sinks into the Death Realm, will it sever its connection with the Myriad Realms, no longer affected by the Great Dao, and thus no longer suppressed?"

Su Yu pondered, "Suppression is still not ideal! After all, it's not just one race entering. If the Human Race isn't affected but other races are suppressed, that's not good!"

Generally, it should sever the influence. The suppression within a realm is related to the realm's master, the strong one who opened it!

Sinking into the Death Realm, the rules established by those who opened the realm should dissipate.

The Fate Emperor nodded. "It should sever. Otherwise, you see, the undead, regardless of race, aren't suppressed in the Death Realm! Because the entire Death Realm is governed by a single power of laws..."

He hesitated slightly. "Emperor Yu, how will we ensure everyone's cultivation? That's a problem! Below the Eternal Realm, one can cultivate with source qi, but above that, one must comprehend the Great Dao!"

Su Yu was also troubled. After thinking for a while, his eyes lit up. "Let's open a small passage! Like the Human Emperor, open a small passage in the Abyssal Realm, draw a part of the Time Dao over..."

It sounded like a heavenly book!

Even Hongmeng couldn't help but ask, "Is that... possible?"

Can it be done?

Qi Rong was also astonished. Is it possible?

Su Yu nodded. "If we find the entry point, it should be operable! Of course, the premise is that I can break through the River of Time, which I think is quite challenging!"

This is akin to digging a hole in the River of Time.

Opening a Dao is opening a specific tributary.

Digging a hole is digging a tributary of myriad Daos; the two are different.

Su Yu stroked his chin. "Moreover, the hole must be stabilized. Otherwise, if everything gushes out at once, it could turn chaotic, which is unacceptable. It must be sorted out gradually, stabilized, and a channel constructed to temporarily accommodate the power of the River of Time... that's the challenge!"

Everyone inhaled sharply, frowning.

This might be the biggest challenge to maintaining cultivation after merging into the Death Realm!

Su Yu's eyes flickered slightly. "To be honest, this is actually a good way to comprehend the Great Dao, to truly touch the power of myriad Daos. Of course, there's danger! But I have the Starry Sky Seal, which should allow some control. Moreover, I don't need to dig as big a hole as the Human Emperor or the Lord of the Undead!"

The Lord of the Undead dug a millstone-sized hole in the River of Time, while the Human Emperor dug a pond-sized one!

Su Yu's requirements weren't high; a bowl-sized hole would suffice!

Enough for everyone to cultivate temporarily!

Unless later, when there are more strong individuals, even a master of laws appears, by then, I'll have fought back, so why care about this?

"The power of myriad Daos flows, and we must sort, integrate, and stabilize it... this is indeed a good way to comprehend the Great Dao!"

Su Yu murmured, "So, this time, I might bring some people with me to dig the hole!"

"......"

Everyone was speechless. You... are really bold!

The Fate Emperor hesitated. "Can it be dug? The River of Time, everyone has encountered it. Even if we can't see it as clearly as Emperor Yu, just diving to the riverbed is a challenge, something ordinary people can't do! Moreover, intercepting the river, that impact force isn't something anyone can withstand; even Daofuse cultivators would be washed away!"

Su Yu laughed. "With the Book of Time and the Starry Sky Seal to stabilize, temporary stabilization is possible! I'll figure it out. What you need to do is simple. I'll dig a hole inside to let the water in, but you need to sort out the river water below, preventing it from mixing, or it will become chaotic power!"

The Fate Emperor suddenly sighed. "Is this a gift for us?"

Just sorting below!

Suddenly, he felt that Su Yu was sometimes truly generous and righteous!

He would dig the hole, allowing everyone to sort the Great Dao below, but the danger levels were different.

Su Yu laughed. "Don't overthink it; it's very challenging! Sorting myriad Daos isn't simple! Moreover, it definitely requires a strong individual to oversee, control, and Blue Sky is needed..."

As he spoke, Su Yu tossed something, and a small girl appeared, her aura weak, with a hint of resentment, looking at Su Yu. "Brother Emperor Yu, I'm done for!"

The Fate Emperor held his forehead!

Damn!

Blue Sky?

I knew Su Yu's words were nonsense!

This is called dead?

Though... pathetically weak, this avatar might only have Sunmoon Realm power, but isn't it still alive?

Su Yu laughed. "Stop whining. Here's your chance to recover! I want to dig a hole in the River of Time. You can catch some of the power of myriad Daos, strengthening your Path of All Beings. This way, you should recover quickly!"

He continued, "I'll find a way to fish out Old Wan. He masters the Human Dao, the seven emotions and six desires. If he can sort out his Human Dao and comprehend the myriad Daos, he might recover quickly..."

"......"

The Fate Emperor looked indifferent.

He actually wanted to ask, who really died?

Don't tell me who didn't die; I know there are many. I just want to know how many truly died!

Su Yu, stroking his chin again, said, "To be honest, if I dig a hole and let everyone sort the power of myriad Daos, maybe everyone can take the opportunity to recover a bit and comprehend the Great Dao. Without the physical body, they won't comprehend the physical Dao but truly comprehend their own Dao... in this way, it's actually a good thing, eliminating the interference of the physical Dao!"

Because the physical Dao has too much influence.

Whether it's the Great Qin King or the Great Xia King, they say they practice spear or knife techniques, but ultimately, they return to the physical Dao. Now, without the physical body, without its influence, it might be a good thing!

Of course, normal people wouldn't do such a thing, blowing up their physical body for better Dao comprehension. How many have cultivated their physical body for countless years? Who would willingly blow it up?

Crazy!

If there's no gain, wouldn't that be a huge loss?

Blue Sky giggled. "Digging a hole? Sounds fun, I want to dig too!"

"Dig what?"

Su Yu retorted. "With your current strength, if you go down, you'll be washed away by the river!"

Su Yu was different. With two treasures, he had hope of diving down, intercepting the river, and digging a bit. Others, even Heavenly Sovereigns, without these treasures, would probably be washed away after a while!

Su Yu cursed under his breath, then quickly smiled and said, "So, if everything goes smoothly this time, everyone's understanding of the Great Dao should improve substantially! Then, those who haven't entered the Dao yet can go and comprehend the map of the Great Dao, and perhaps they'll make some progress too!"

"The only issue is..." Su Yu frowned, "The physical body is hard to restore. It's not that it can't be restored, but it's difficult to return it to its previous state! No matter how strong a cultivator is, even if they don't walk the path of the physical body, their body won't be weak, as it's the vessel of their power! But restoring the body requires the power of the physical body's rules to supplement it..."

Suddenly, Su Yu cursed, "That bastard Hundred Battle has monopolized the path of the physical body. As a result, the physical power we can draw upon is limited, making the restoration quite challenging! Otherwise, the body would be easier to repair!"

Nearby, the Fate Emperor couldn't help but ask in a low voice, "From what Emperor Yu is saying... does that mean everyone's physical bodies have fallen, but their seas of will... are still intact?"

Su Yu looked at him, squinting with a smile, "What do you think?"

What do I think? I think, perhaps, not a single one of them is dead. Damn! They're not human! I had previously assumed that with such a tragic battle, surely some would have died. But it turns out... none of them did?

The myriad races and the Hundred Battle King were all played by you?

As these thoughts raced through the Fate Emperor's mind, Su Yu waved his hand, and nearby, clusters of light appeared. They were all seas of will!

Soon, one shadow after another emerged, looking at each other with a mix of helplessness and sadness.

We're done for! We've all become seas of will! Where are we now?

Good heavens, everyone saw familiar faces; they were all still alive.

Among these shadows, Marquis Dingjun spoke with a heavy voice, "Emperor Yu, what about the others?"

He didn't see many people! He didn't see Wan Tiansheng, nor those ancient marquises and powerful figures; he only saw a few, like General Yingwu and Marquis Huoyun, but not Shadow, Yunshui, or the later four.

Su Yu calmly replied, "Don't you already know?"

A look of pain flashed in Marquis Dingjun's eyes, and his shadow wavered slightly, "I..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "Alright, most of them are probably still alive, though it seems some have died. Shadow might be dead, but it's unclear. Perhaps Hundred Battle has a chance to save them!"

Marquis Dingjun remained silent.

Nearby, Lantian looked at Su Yu in surprise, "This guy knows too?"

He just found out!

Su Yu chuckled, "Even if he didn't know, after so many years, he must have guessed something, right? Marquis Dingjun might be straightforward, but that doesn't mean he's a fool. If he were truly foolish, how could he have survived when so many others died?"

Su Yu mocked, "Heavendoom, that guy, seems reckless, but he's as cunning as a fox. Let alone Marquis Dingjun!"

Over there, the shadow of Heavendoom glanced around, as if to say, "Are you talking about me?"

Do you think I'll respond to you? Impossible!

And Marquis Dingjun, his shadow wavered for a moment, then he said dejectedly, "I... just had some suspicions because the Hundred Battle King... isn't someone who can be easily tricked... Before this, we were undefeated in a hundred battles!"

Yes, undefeated in a hundred battles, and even if we didn't win, it was the allied races' strongmen who died.

Yet, in one fell swoop, everyone was lost!

Moreover, before this, those who went to their deaths were all Hundred Battle's direct subordinates. Some things, after all, can be seen through, especially after six thousand years. Over these six thousand years, they've guessed some things, even if they didn't know at the time.

Su Yu said indifferently, "So, you didn't know about the plan?"

Marquis Dingjun awkwardly replied, "I didn't know."

"Heh!"

It was a mocking laugh, and Marquis Dingjun understood!

Marquis Dingjun helplessly said, "At that time, my strength was somewhat weaker, and... my personality was rather straightforward. Perhaps the Hundred Battle King thought that if he told me, I... I might leak it, or inadvertently expose it?"

After saying that, he looked hopeful and asked, "Emperor Yu, since you can fake our deaths today, then back in those days... were those comrades, those colleagues, truly dead or just pretending?"

Since Su Yu could disguise their deaths, what about Hundred Battle?

This, he wasn't too sure about.

Su Yu calmly replied, "Not too sure. Some definitely died! If I were Hundred Battle, those who didn't listen, who didn't obey, I wouldn't care if they lived or died. Dead is dead. It's impossible for none of them to have truly died; that would be too abnormal!"

Nearby, the shadow of Marquis Huoyun spoke heavily, "A batch must have died. If I remember correctly, a batch of people died in battle later. Most of them are probably truly dead, but those who died to pave the way earlier are likely still alive! Because later, when the Hundred Battle King was sealed, he didn't have enough time to arrange for their rescue... Of course, someone might have secretly collected the bodies."

Su Yu was surprised, "You don't know either?"

That can't be right?

He thought Marquis Huoyun might know the plan.

But Marquis Huoyun sighed and shook his head, "I am a direct subordinate of King Yue. My loyalty lies with Lord Yue, and I don't walk the path of the physical body, so there might have been some barriers..."

"Nonsense!"

Su Yu laughed, "Yunshui and Shadow didn't walk the path of the physical body either, nor were they direct subordinates of King Dou! It can only be said that you few weren't entirely loyal to Hundred Battle! You people... each one of you, there's nothing more to say."

These people didn't know Hundred Battle's plan, which only meant they weren't completely loyal to Hundred Battle.

Those loyal to Hundred Battle, Su Yu believed, should know the situation.

Marquis Huoyun didn't argue.

Perhaps!

Complete loyalty?

Sometimes, it's not that simple. The more straightforward one is, the harder it is to transfer loyalty from a former benefactor to a new one.

Marquis Dingjun and Marquis Huoyun both had their own benefactors, and it wasn't easy to just pledge loyalty to someone else.

And Su Yu, glancing at the silent Great Zhou King, said nothing.

Soon, he briefly mentioned his plan.

"The physical body isn't easy to restore to its previous state, but you can comprehend the Great Dao, get closer to it. Even if the physical body's strength doesn't fully recover, it should regain some. Plus, if the power of the Great Dao's rules becomes strong, your combat power might not be lower than before!"

"Then, once the physical body is restored, your strength might even improve!"

In the crowd, General Yingwu suddenly asked, "Yunshui... did she deceive me?"

Su Yu laughed, "What do you mean by deceive? Her admiration for the Culture King might be genuine, her disdain for Hundred Battle might also be genuine, but later she was subdued by Hundred Battle. How can that be called deception? Besides... if she did deceive you, what can you do about it?"

"......"

General Yingwu was extremely depressed and fell silent.

The Great Ming King hurriedly asked, "What about Wan Tiansheng?"

Is he truly dead?

"Director Wan... I still need to take a trip to the River of Time to check!"

Wan Tiansheng's opponent was a Heavenly Sovereign, so it wasn't easy for his sea of will to escape, and it was hard to fake it, because at that time, Yue Hao and the others were all watching, and the battle reached its final stage.

So Wan Tiansheng was truly shattered.

But Old Wan had made preparations, leaving some things in his own Great Dao, so he should be retrievable.

Su Yu didn't say much more and quickly said, "I'll first retrieve Director Wan, then I'll find a way to open a passage, merging the Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm. Everyone can comprehend the Great Dao, sort out the Great Dao. This is an opportunity! No destruction, no construction. Break and then establish! Usually, your physical bodies hinder your observation of the Dao. Later, I'll find a way to restore your physical bodies... If that doesn't work, we'll kill Hundred Battle and seize his path of the physical body!"

Su Yu's smile was radiant.

And beside him, Qirong suddenly spoke in a low voice, "Su Human Lord..."

"I'm no longer the Human Lord!"

Su Yu smiled lightly, "Just call me by my name!"

"Su... forget it, I'll call you whatever they call you."

Qirong quickly adjusted her mindset and said, "Emperor Yu, restoring the physical body doesn't necessarily require the human path of the physical body. All paths lead to the same origin. The path of the physical body isn't limited to the human path of the physical body! I see these two seem to be walking a different path of the physical body..."

She pointed at the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, her eyes sharp, as these two currently lacked physical bodies.

"This path, I think, might be possible to split, so everyone can walk it together, restore some physical power... It doesn't necessarily require fusion, but rather extracting some physical power..."

She suggested, "The world's Great Daos, as I mentioned before, of the same origin and kind, can ultimately be merged..."

Upon hearing this, the Great Zhou King, who had remained silent, suddenly looked at Qirong and after a while said, "Are you the Consort of King Qi?"

Qirong looked at him, frowning slightly.

The Great Zhou King softly said, "The Consort of King Qi is indeed learned and knowledgeable! The same origin and kind of Dao can be merged. Emperor Yu should have seen this too. The non-human path of the physical body is also a path of the physical body, only modified in ancient times to better suit a certain race! The path of the Desolate Beast that the Great Qin King cultivates is also a type of physical body path, and some physical power can be extracted from it... But doing so will weaken this path, and Old Qin and Old Xia might have to change paths again!"

Su Yu stroked his chin and smiled, "Well... that might not be a bad idea. I see these two are progressing too slowly on the path of the physical body. They might as well walk the path of the blade and spear. They don't necessarily have to walk the same path as Xia Longwu; they can walk a different one! Any path of the blade and spear will do, because the ultimate goal is to unify the paths!"

Of course, that's a matter for the future.

At this moment, the Great Qin King grumbled, "Alright, I also feel I'm not quite suited for the path of the physical body. Old Xia and I are more suited for the path of the blade and spear!"

That's great!

The path of the Desolate Beast wasn't wasted, at least now it can be shared among everyone!

Together, they can restore their physical bodies!

In this way, everyone's strength will recover even faster. As for what was lost... perhaps nothing was lost, just some people who weren't trustworthy.

Su Yu chuckled, "Then let's get moving! Wrap everything up quickly, focus on cultivating, and let them fight it out! If everyone wants to play the turtle, we'll play along for a while too. Once we've gathered enough strength, we'll have nothing to fear!"

As for Su Yu himself, he needed to consider the matter of opening his own path.

The pen dao... it was just that!

Su Yu wasn't particularly keen on merging with the pen dao. Of course, if the opportunity arose, he could seize all the power of the pen dao. No, there was no need to seize it; it was already his!

Why not just strip the power of the pen dao entirely and integrate it into his Mark of Civilization? What could the Culture King do about it?

He didn't want it anymore; he passed it on to me, so isn't it mine now?

Honestly!

With that thought, Su Yu rubbed his chin. It made sense; this dao should indeed belong to him!

From the Culture King's pen dao, it would authentically become Su Yu's pen dao.
