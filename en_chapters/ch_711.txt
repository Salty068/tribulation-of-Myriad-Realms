Chapter 711: The Chaos Clan (Subscription Requested)

Escape, impossible to resist!

This was the only thought in the mind of Marquis Blood Dragon. In an instant, three Daofuse Realm experts had been slain. This was unimaginable, indicating the presence of a top-tier powerhouse capable of crushing them. Otherwise, no matter how weak a Daofuse expert might be, they should at least be able to delay a top-tier opponent for a while. But now, there was no delay at all. It was too fast, incredibly fast.

The opponent must have used spatial teleportation. Otherwise, even a Heavenly King couldn’t have crossed the distance between the three Dragon Cities so quickly to kill three Daofuse experts.

Who was it?

In the next moment, he knew.

At that moment, above the second Dragon City, an enormous golden dragon appeared in the sky. Its tail swept across the heavens, seemingly breaking through the sealing formation, roaring in fury, "It's Dingjun, it's Marquis Dingjun!"

Marquis Dingjun!

Marquis Blood Dragon, who was battling Lantian, trembled slightly. It was that mysterious group!

Damn it, it was them.

Meanwhile, on the side of Marquis Golden Dragon, the chief steward under Marquis Dingjun, Steward Chongming, could no longer hold back. His aura erupted, rumbling as waves of the power of laws surged, advancing!

He had long been capable of advancing but had refrained due to concerns about causing too much commotion. Today, however, he advanced freely!

Because Marquis Golden Dragon was being suppressed, the entire Dragon Clan was being suppressed, and no one cared whether he advanced or not.

Marquis Blood Dragon glanced over, gritting his teeth, and roared, "Escape!"

Escape was the only option!

The Phoenix Clan seemed to be sending reinforcements. He could even sense the aura of a Phoenix Clan expert. However, this group moved too quickly. Even if Marquis Fengqi, a quasi-king realm expert, were to rush to the Dragon Tail region, it would take at least three minutes.

That was the minimum!

And it would require full effort.

The two clans were somewhat distant from each other, not entirely together. If they were, it would be too dangerous in the event of a war. This was also a precaution each clan took against the others.

But now, it became an obstacle to rescue.

More than three minutes—could the Dragon Clan hold out?

Could anyone besides himself hold out?

Moreover, it would take time to move from the Dragon Tail to the Dragon Head.

Marquis Blood Dragon roared, his entire body surging with blood energy. With a claw, he tore Lantian apart!

However, in an instant, another Lantian appeared.

At this moment, the new Lantian carried a certain holy radiance, his face gentle as he said, "My people, merge with me! I am the Path of All Beings, and all beings are me!"

The Path of All Beings!

At this moment, Lantian's Path of All Beings finally unleashed its true power!

Marquis Blood Dragon felt his own power of the Great Dao being compressed. Simultaneously, it seemed as if some force was trying to merge him, to make him one with it. His power of the Great Dao was being infused with countless powers of laws.

Marquis Blood Dragon felt a bit dazed. So warm!

It was the scent of a mother!

No, it was the scent of a dragon egg.

At this moment, he seemed to return to the dragon egg, back to that carefree time, playing and amusing himself, the most innocent and carefree period of his life.

"Come back!"

That holy Lantian, with a warm smile, said, "The Path of All Beings, all beings are me, and I am all beings. We are one, aren't we?"

Marquis Blood Dragon shook his massive head, suddenly roaring again.

On the Great Dao, a blood dragon roared madly!

No!

This was interference with the Great Dao. The opponent was interfering with his Great Dao.

He struggled, but Lantian's power of the Great Dao instantly transformed into a net, enveloping his blood dragon's shadow, gentle, soothing, majestic, and reproachful!

It was as if a father was scolding a disobedient child.

"Blood Dragon, how could you!"

At this moment, one Lantian after another appeared, one dragon-shaped Lantian after another, with a majestic dragon saying, "Obey!"

A dragon roared angrily, "How dare you disrespect your ancestors?"

"Impudent, surrender now!"

"Brother Blood Dragon, stop fighting, okay?"

"Daddy Blood Dragon, stop fighting, I'm scared..."

One Lantian after another, eerily powerful, with strands of the power of laws continuously eroding the power of Marquis Blood Dragon's Great Dao.

This powerful Dragon Clan expert, at this moment, his eyes flickered between daze, fear, terror, and love...

Marquis Blood Dragon, who had been roaring, now shook his massive head continuously, disturbed!

The terrifying aspect of the Path of All Beings was now fully revealed.

And one Lantian after another slowly approached. In the next moment, dozens of Lantians suddenly closed in and erupted!

Boom!

They attacked simultaneously, pounding Marquis Blood Dragon until he was drenched in blood!

"Roar!"

A painful roar echoed through the heavens. At this moment, Marquis Blood Dragon regained clarity, dragon blood splattering through the void, filled with endless pain and struggle, suddenly roaring, "Kill, kill him!"

He wasn't speaking to Lantian but to the Eternal experts in Blood Dragon City.

There were many!

The Dragon Clan had no shortage of Eternals. Even under Marquis Dingjun, there were many. In his city, there were dozens of Eternals.

Come quickly, rescue!

One or two were useless, but with enough Eternals, all mastering the power of laws, they were technically on the same level as Daofuse experts, just with less mastery of the power of laws.

Coming to the rescue could still have some effect.

And at this moment, the Dragon Clan in the city panicked. After a moment of hesitation, some Eternal Dragons flew rapidly in this direction.

However, they hadn't flown far when suddenly many dragons appeared around them.

These Dragon Clan experts were slightly taken aback.

In the next moment, suddenly a dragon they recognized went berserk, charging at them, and with a rumbling explosion, the heavens and earth shattered, dragon blood splattering through the void.

In an instant, two or three of the seven or eight dragons that had just flown out died, including the one that had just attacked.

But at this moment, the remaining dragons were suddenly terrified!

They looked at each other with extreme vigilance, quickly separating.

Was there a traitor among us?

Impossible!

Why would this happen?

But Marquis Blood Dragon saw clearly and roared, "That's his avatar, a disguise, not betrayal!"

Lantian was stirring the waters!

His avatar, disguised as a dragon, slaughtered, instantly instilling fear in the Dragon Clan experts. They worried that the dragon beside them might raise a butcher's knife against them in the next moment.

"Little darling, shut up!"

Lantian chuckled softly, too talkative.

Poof!

Lantian transformed into a giant dragon, battling Marquis Blood Dragon in the sky.

At this moment, this giant dragon exuded strands of chaotic aura. Marquis Blood Dragon, upon clashing with the opponent, suddenly changed color!

"Who are you?"

He roared, "Chaotic aura! Are you human or an ancient beast?"

"Are you from Chaos Mountain?"

Chaotic aura!

Yes, at this moment, Lantian also exuded a faint chaotic aura.

Marquis Blood Dragon was horrified, realizing something.

As Su Yu had thought, these top experts of the myriad races knew some things, even if they didn't know before, they learned after the last tide.

It seemed that the Myriad Realms still hid a group of experts.

However, they didn't seem to get along with the Human Clan.

Similarly, these people were also human.

For example, the one who rescued Hundred Battle thousands of years ago, the one who tricked Hundred Battle at the end of the last tide.

Some of these people also possessed some chaotic aura.

He was filled with terror. It was this group!

Damn it, this group had emerged.

Whose side were they on?

Filled with confusion and doubt, he no longer wished to fight, the giant dragon's tail sweeping, shattering the void, fleeing rapidly, impossible to resist!

Just facing this guy, he was already struggling.

Moreover, there were still strong opponents over there.

And just as he was about to flee, boom!

Another loud explosion rang out. In the distance, Su Yu and the Great Zhou King had caught up with the fourth Daofuse expert. At this moment, Su Yu, like a primordial beast, tore the fourth Daofuse Dragon Clan expert in half!

Dragon head and dragon tail separated!

With a bite, truly ferocious beyond compare, like a beast just released from its cage, exuding a savage aura, biting the opponent's sea of will into shreds!

Boom!

The loud noise was caused by the massive overflow of the power of laws, the Great Dao directly torn apart!

Dead!

The fourth Daofuse expert!

Ninety seconds.

At this moment, not even two minutes had passed.

The fourth Daofuse expert had fallen!

And the fifth, the only one without an opponent, not weak, at the third-tier Daofuse level, was fleeing madly, already far away.

This Dragon Clan expert had only one thought, escape!

He didn't head for the Dragon Head or the Dragon Tail.

He was fleeing south, in the opposite direction of the Dragon Clan!

Over by the Dragon Tail, Su Yu and his group were killing their way through. At the Dragon Head, both Marquis Golden Dragon and Marquis Blood Dragon, these two peerless experts, were entangled and unable to break free. How could he run in that direction?

The only option was to flee south!

He fled frantically, burning blood essence, burning flesh, his aura incredibly powerful. He didn't care about anything else, only knowing that if he couldn't escape, he might die!

It was that simple!

When Su Yu killed the fourth Daofuse expert and glanced over, he was slightly stunned.

Wow!

Really fast!

In just this short moment, this guy had already fled over ten thousand miles!

If they pursued, it might take two or three minutes to catch up, even if the Great Zhou King could teleport, it would require one or two teleports. Returning, turning back, would take at least three or four minutes, and killing him might delay things, taking five or six minutes.

Five or six minutes... forget it, too long.

Su Yu chuckled, looked at the Great Zhou King, and quickly said, "Marquis Golden Dragon!"

The Great Zhou King didn't even need his reminder; he knew Su Yu wouldn't pursue.

If they pursued, they could kill.

But... if it took too long, something might happen.

Forget it, if one escaped, then one escaped.

In an instant, the two teleported towards the second city, teleporting two or three times in succession, and only then did Su Yu and the Great Zhou King arrive at the second giant city.

At this moment, Marquis Golden Dragon was roaring madly!

Five Daofuse experts were besieging him!

Though powerful, Marquis Dingjun was no weakling either.

Fortunately, September, to avoid exposing his identity, was mainly playing a supporting role. Otherwise, Marquis Golden Dragon would be in even more trouble.

When he sensed someone arriving above, despair flashed in Marquis Golden Dragon's dragon eyes.

They had arrived!

Too fast!

He hadn't yet shaken off these two ruthless individuals, who had just slain four Daofuse Realm experts, and now they had arrived. With a slight sense, he knew that these two were not weaker than him. Among them, the Great Zhou King was even stronger.

"You bastards, if I die, don't think you'll have it easy!"

Before the two could reach him, a fierce look flashed in the eyes of Marquis Jinlong. Suddenly, he let out a furious roar, and boom! A deafening explosion echoed!

Bang!

Marquis Dingjun's face changed dramatically. At this moment, his spear erupted with an incredibly powerful aura, and he shouted, "How dare you!"

Marquis Jinlong, a top-tier existence, had actually self-destructed! His purpose was nothing other than to kill!

In his final moments, he wanted to take someone down with him. With Su Yu and the Great Zhou King arriving, he knew he was doomed! Moreover, with these two here, killing him wouldn't even require much effort. Since he couldn't escape, he chose to self-destruct and take an enemy with him. Killing one would be worth it; killing two would be a profit!

That was his thought, but Marquis Dingjun was anxious!

He was the strongest here, leading the team. Su Yu had instructed them not to be careless, with the sole purpose of entangling Marquis Jinlong, not killing him, and no one was to die. If anyone died, they would have to answer for it!

At this moment, Marquis Jinlong's self-destruction was unexpected. The decisiveness of this ancient dragon marquis surprised even Marquis Dingjun. It was too decisive! There wasn't even a hint of struggle, which created a huge problem for Marquis Dingjun!

Boom!

The continuous explosions shattered Marquis Dingjun's spear, and the powerful blast instantly shattered most of his body. Marquis Dingjun roared madly, and at this moment, others also took action!

Su Yu and the Great Zhou King also changed their expressions and quickly acted!

Rumble!

Under a series of attacks, the aftermath of Marquis Jinlong's self-destruction dissipated completely. The others were mostly unharmed, but Marquis Dingjun was left with only half of his body. At this moment, his spear was shattered, his face pale, and he looked at Su Yu with some helplessness and disappointment. "I didn't expect him to self-destruct... I was careless!"

A second-tier Daofuse expert, damn it, just self-destructed like that!

If it weren't for the fact that they had more people on their side, they might not have been able to stop him, and he might have been blown to pieces. If he hadn't been in front, others, especially the newly Daofuse Chongming, would have been blown to bits!

Even though he blocked it, he was still seriously injured.

Su Yu frowned slightly but quickly relaxed. "You did well. Self-destruction is something no one wants!"

Self-destruction is something that can't be stopped unless you're much stronger than the opponent.

"Can you still move?"

"I can..."

Marquis Dingjun barely recovered his body, feeling somewhat weak. "It's just that my strength has dropped significantly. I'm afraid... I can't even handle a fifth-tier Daofuse now!"

He was still heavily injured!

"No matter!"

Su Yu said, quickly adding, "Clear out the Eternals here, destroy the city, and seize the treasures!"

With that, Su Yu grabbed the Great Ming King and quickly teleported to the dragon's head. He didn't bring others, as they were there to set up formations on the periphery.

To deal with the Heavenly Kings, others shouldn't get involved, as it could easily lead to accidents. With him, the Great Zhou King, and Lantian, it was enough.

At this moment, only two minutes had passed.

There was still time!

Marquis Jinlong's self-destruction had saved him quite a bit of time.

...

"Jinlong!"

Marquis Xuelong roared with some unwillingness and despair.

It was over!

Marquis Jinlong was dead!

And he couldn't shake off this freak in front of him.

The seven Daofuse experts stationed in the dragon territory, including Heavenly Kings and peak Daofuse, had their defenses breached just like that!

Except for the Wind Dragon Dao Master, the others were all dead.

At this moment, Marquis Xuelong was extremely unwilling.

He wanted to escape, but he couldn't.

Although Lantian had just opened his path, it was already at its peak. Lantian's path was too long and too far-reaching. Even after opening his path, he had the combat power of a Heavenly King, showcasing the strength of the Path of All Beings.

Marquis Xuelong felt that his own power of the Great Dao had long been entangled, even merging with Lantian's.

At this moment, he couldn't escape, and in battle, he shattered one clone after another, while that freak quickly produced more clones, as if he could never be killed!

"Who are you?"

Marquis Xuelong's voice was filled with exhaustion and some unwillingness.

He had already sensed spatial fluctuations.

Sure enough, moments later, he saw three people.

One person entered the void, quickly setting up a grand formation to intercept his escape, though it wasn't even necessary.

That grand formation... was it to block the aura?

Was it necessary?

Marquis Xuelong and Lantian were entangled, and he shouted again, "Who are you?"

Before Su Yu and the others could answer, he suddenly shouted, "Are you from Chaos Mountain?"

"Are you the same group that dealt with Hundred Battle and rescued him?"

"You've finally shown your fangs. Do you think the myriad races are truly unaware of your existence? Self-deception! We never knew your whereabouts, but today you've exposed yourselves, and sooner or later, you'll die!"

He shouted with anger, unwillingness, and a last glimmer of hope, "Let me go, and I can cooperate with you! My Dragon Clan has formidable power both in the Dao Source Land and the lower realms!"

"As long as you let me go, the Dragon Clan can cooperate with you!"

"The Dragon Clan is not like the gods or demons. We don't aspire to be the overlords of the heavens. Serving one is serving all. Let me go, and my Dragon Clan can submit!"

To save himself, he was willing to submit to these people.

But Su Yu, walking step by step with a mocking smile and arrogance, said indifferently, "No need! Trash is trash! My clan is destined to unify the Myriad Realms and recreate the heavens and earth! We are not the foolish Human Clan. Call us the Chaos Clan!"

Chaos Clan!

Marquis Xuelong's heart trembled. This person was Human Clan; he could feel it. But the other party claimed he wasn't Human Clan but Chaos Clan.

Who was he?

Marquis Xuelong looked at the grand formation on the periphery, then at the chaotic aura on Su Yu and Lantian, with some seriousness. He gritted his teeth and said, "Chaos Clan? Ridiculous, you're just traitors of the Human Clan, just like us. A laughable Chaos Clan..."

Su Yu coldly said, "Ignorant fool! You pathetic creature, you'll never understand the greatness of my lineage! Even in ancient times, my lineage was incomparably noble. Who in heaven and earth today is greater than my lineage?"

"Kill!"

After saying a few words, Su Yu gave a low shout. The Great Zhou King's power of the Great Dao was unleashed, and Su Yu quickly attacked without any fancy moves.

A direct assault!

He and Lantian quickly surrounded Marquis Xuelong, while the Great Zhou King continuously interfered from the periphery. The battle was extremely intense.

Killing a Heavenly King was truly not easy.

Su Yu and Lantian went all out, fighting fiercely.

Marquis Xuelong bled continuously, his dragon claws and tail were broken, and his dragon body was covered in wounds. Yet, his combat power remained extremely strong, shattering Lantian's clones and severely injuring Su Yu's body!

But Su Yu didn't care about these, waiting all the while.

After waiting for a long time, his eyes suddenly lit up. In the next moment, amidst Marquis Xuelong's roars, a pen silently appeared in his hand.

Marquis Xuelong was battling Lantian when he suddenly froze. In the next moment, his large eyes showed anger and terror, "No, you tricked me!"

Culture King!

This was the legacy of the Culture King's lineage!

He wasn't from the Chaos Clan!

After fighting for so long, he knew he wouldn't survive today. In a special way, he left some information here.

Chaos Clan, chaotic aura, a shielding grand formation...

He left information about these. If a strong Dragon Clan member came to investigate, they could find some clues.

Of course, outsiders couldn't see it.

But at this moment, when Su Yu's pen dao appeared, he immediately realized he had been fooled!

These people might not be from the Chaos Clan but from the Culture King's lineage. They had deceived him, deliberately letting him leave some information with his life.

"Too late!"

As Su Yu's pen dao emerged, his strength increased. After a long battle, Marquis Xuelong was already extremely weak.

At this moment, Su Yu pointed with his pen!

Crack!

It struck right at Marquis Xuelong's Great Dao, which Su Yu could see clearly. He directly pointed at the Great Dao, creating a crack.

The Great Dao quickly shifted, but in Su Yu's eyes, it was too slow.

There was no concealment!

Another stroke, followed by dozens of strokes!

Boom!

A thunderous explosion echoed, and with a rumble, the Great Dao shattered!

Marquis Xuelong's body couldn't withstand such a powerful backlash and exploded. His sea of will turned into a shadow, trying to escape through the void. At this moment, the Great Zhou King smiled, extended his hand, and directly broke through the void, grabbing the sphere. With a bang, the sphere shattered!

Boom!

The entire northern region was now displaying a shocking phenomenon!

Countless powers of laws exploded!

Like a firework illuminating the heavens!

Killing a strong expert in the Upper Realm was more like setting off fireworks. The stronger they were, the more brilliant they became!

...

In the distance.

A Phoenix Clan expert who had just flown to the dragon's tail showed a look of fear in her eyes. In the next moment, she turned around and flew away!

This top-tier Heavenly King-level expert quickly flew towards Phoenix City.

If Marquis Xuelong wasn't dead, she would dare to fight.

But with Marquis Xuelong dead, she'd be crazy to go over there.

A sharp cry echoed throughout the Phoenix Clan's territory, "All Daofuse, gather! All Eternals, converge! Quickly!"

Defend!

Something big had happened!

The Dragon Clan had instantly lost six Daofuse experts. Except for the Wind Dragon who escaped, even Marquis Xuelong was killed. Such a major upheaval left the Phoenix Clan experts in extreme fear.

The Dragon Clan was strong!

Stronger than the Phoenix Clan, and now they were finished just like that!

...

But Su Yu didn't care about the Phoenix Clan.

The Mark of Civilization devoured the heavens and earth!

He glanced coldly at the fleeing Dragon Clan members, "Kill, kill every one you see, kill them all, quickly plunder the entire Dragon Clan's wealth, hurry!"

In an instant, the experts dispersed.

Soon, the sound of tragic screams echoed continuously.

A group of top-tier Daofuse experts, killing Eternals, was too easy!

Boom!

Moments later, the massive Blood Dragon City was leveled!

See a dragon, kill a dragon!

Treasures were also plundered in large quantities, countless treasure troves opened, and treasure light illuminated the heavens.

Countless Dragon Clan members fled in all directions, escaping!

Chapter 1: The Chaos Unleashed

In the blink of an eye, September arrived, and with it, a devouring force that consumed everything in its path. The massive Blood Dragon City was swallowed whole, leaving nothing behind. The Golden Dragon City had long since vanished.

A group of Daofuse cultivators began to converge, led by the Great Zhou King, who continued to teleport them from one city to the next—third, fourth, fifth... In a mere eight minutes, nine cities lay in ruins, and the Dragon Clan's territory had all but disappeared.

Su Yu gazed into the distance and shouted, "Retreat!"

There was still one Dragon City standing, and many Eternals remained alive, but staying any longer would be courting death. Su Yu had already spotted several towering pillars of light rushing towards them from afar. Heavenly Kings! They had to be Heavenly Kings, and they felt even more formidable than the Blood Dragon Marquis!

Not just one, but three pillars of light. Coupled with the nearby Phoenix Clan experts, that made four Heavenly King-level powerhouses. Staying would be suicidal.

The Great Zhou King, panting heavily, quickly initiated a teleportation. Su Yu, meanwhile, took out a stone to suppress the spatial fluctuations, laughing as he did so, "Stop panting..."

"I'm really... exhausted!" The Great Zhou King was genuinely tired. It wasn't an act. Damn it! How could you not believe me? I've teleported so many times already. Do you really think I'm made of iron?

At this moment, everyone else was also panting heavily. September's belly was swollen from overeating. As he opened his mouth, a dragon flew out, which he quickly bit in half before clamping his mouth shut again. "I'm stuffed. I can't go on. Emperor Yu, let's run. I need to find a place to digest!"

The Marquis of Dingjun was severely injured but extremely excited, looking at Su Yu and the others with eager eyes. Su Yu ignored him and quickly said, "Let's go!"

Boom!

The teleportation activated, and in an instant, they vanished. The spatial fluctuations were swiftly suppressed.

This time, the Great Zhou King seemed genuinely exhausted. During the teleportation, his breathing was as loud as a bellows, continuously gasping and teleporting.

They didn't head directly to Chaos Mountain. Instead, they teleported over a dozen times, taking a circuitous route before finally arriving in the Chaos Mountain region.

Su Yu quickly instructed, "You all head back to Dao Origin Mountain first."

"What about you?"

"I'll take a different path, leave some traces and noise!"

Su Yu glanced towards the depths of Chaos Mountain and smiled, "I'll stir up a few ancient beasts. Stop talking and go back first. If the myriad races manage to track us, follow my route and delve deeper into Chaos Mountain!"

The others didn't argue further. The Great Zhou King advised, "Be careful!"

"Don't worry!"

Su Yu had cooperated well with him this time, so he was more polite than usual. He quickly departed, leaving a trail of chaotic energy as he flew deeper into the mountain.

The myriad races might not dare to pursue them into Chaos Mountain, but it was best to be thorough. If there were any experts skilled in tracking, they might find some clues along his escape route.

As he sped along, a few ancient beasts were startled. However, sensing the chaotic aura, they didn't interfere.

Su Yu continued to race forward until he reached a primeval forest. He didn't enter but lingered on the outskirts for a moment before swiftly retreating, concealing his aura.

Time to return!

They had killed six Daofuse cultivators, including a Heavenly King. Not a bad haul. That was enough for today.

The night view of Chaos Mountain was quite beautiful, and Su Yu was quite satisfied. Since arriving in the Upper Realm, he had taken down eight Daofuse cultivators. None of his own people had died, though the Marquis of Dingjun was seriously injured. Lantian's avatars had exploded a few times, but with some time to recover, it wasn't a big issue.

Su Yu continually weighed the pros and cons in his mind. Overall, this surprise attack was executed perfectly. The only downside was that there wouldn't be another opportunity like this. After today, the myriad races would surely regroup quickly.

But it was enough!

As for the situation at Divine Fire Mountain, the smaller clans' Daofuse cultivators wouldn't go there again, that was certain. As for the larger clans' Daofuse cultivators... it was hard to say.

The fate of the Marquis of Huoyun was uncertain. Su Yu could only leave it to luck.

...

As Su Yu and his group fled, the entire Upper Realm was on the brink of chaos!

In the Dragon Clan's territory, powerful figures arrived swiftly. The void was continuously torn apart. Immortals, demons, gods, phoenixes, and apes... all the major strong clans sent their top experts.

Seven or eight Heavenly King-level experts arrived, their auras shaking the heavens and earth. The entire northern region was filled with their presence, causing the local power of laws to explode continuously.

Six Daofuse cultivators had just died!

This place was already a chaotic mess of rules.

Moments later, a bloodied giant dragon flew back. It was the fleeing Wind Dragon, who, sensing the arrival of many powerful figures, returned. Its body was covered in blood, its aura weak.

The Wind Dragon glanced towards the direction of Dragon City. Of the nine giant cities, only one remained. A wave of sorrow washed over it.

"Our Dragon Clan... is finished!"

The Wind Dragon wept bitterly!

The quasi-king was dead, and the five Dao Masters had perished with him. The Heavenly Dragon Marquis was still in the Lower Realm, at the Source of the Dao. The Dragon Clan had other experts, but not many. The Wind Dragon wasn't sure how many, but it knew that after this, the Dragon Clan would fall from being one of the top five dominant races to somewhere below the top ten.

The losses were too severe!

Not only that, but a heap of powerful figures had died, not to mention the four or five dozen Eternals. Below the Eternal level, they were nearly wiped out. Only that one Dragon City still housed fifty to sixty thousand giant dragons.

Previously, the Upper Realm's Dragon Clan numbered over a million!

Now, not even one in ten remained!

Such losses were unimaginable.

The top experts remained silent, their expressions grave. At this moment, the Marquis of Blood Severance, the Immortal Battle Marquis, and others had all arrived, even neglecting the situation at Divine Fire Mountain.

Compared to the fate of the Marquis of Huoyun, the near-extinction of the Dragon Clan was the real issue!

If they could wipe out the Dragon Clan, they could wipe out the Phoenix Clan, or any race other than the top three!

This was a force capable of altering the entire Upper Realm's balance!

Everyone was deeply concerned.

They continued to observe, investigate, and track.

After a long time, the Marquis of Blood Severance said darkly, "It's the same group as last time!"

The same group that had struck ten days ago!

These people were too reckless, committing crimes repeatedly within ten days, killing eight Daofuse cultivators, four or five dozen Eternals, and nearly wiping out a million dragons!

At this moment, the heavily injured Wind Dragon roared for a while before gritting its teeth and saying, "It's the Marquis of Dingjun! The Golden Dragon Marquis saw them and shouted out. It's them!"

It was the same group as last time!

Now, the others' faces turned grim. The Marquis of Dingjun, it really was him.

Even a Heavenly King had been killed!

A quasi-king was considered the highest level of existence. Of course, in the Upper Realm, quasi-kings varied in strength. Those close to the realm of the Master of Rules were also called quasi-kings, as were Heavenly King-level figures.

The Blood Dragon Marquis wasn't particularly strong among them.

However, being able to kill a quasi-king represented supreme combat power, meaning this group posed a threat to anyone.

The group quickly turned to the Wind Dragon. The Immortal Battle Marquis asked heavily, "How many of them were there? Did you see?"

The Wind Dragon quickly replied, "From the time Dragon Extinction was killed, there should have been two people. I saw what seemed like two people! The one who ambushed the Blood Dragon Marquis seemed to be alone... As for the Golden Dragon Marquis, I don't know how many there were exactly. The Marquis of Dingjun was among them, and there was another, who seemed to be the Marquis of Dingjun's subordinate, Chongming, who took the opportunity to reach Daofuse..."

"The Marquis of Dingjun isn't a match for the Golden Dragon Marquis. If you couldn't tell how many there were, there must have been at least three or four Daofuse cultivators!"

The Immortal Battle Marquis said heavily, "This group, along with the Marquis of Dingjun and his people, probably numbers seven or eight!"

"One quasi-king, at least two top-tier Daofuse cultivators!"

To quickly slay four Daofuse cultivators, if there were only two people, they must be top-tier!

This was an extremely powerful force!

The Marquis of Blood Severance said coldly, "It's impossible for so many powerful figures to appear out of nowhere. Otherwise, we would have known something. So where did this group come from?"

At this moment, in the distance, a Phoenix Clan expert flew over.

The Marquis of Fengqi said solemnly, "I sensed something from afar. It seemed... there was some chaotic energy!"

At this time, an old man flew over from the shattered Dragon City, nodding, "I also found some clues. There was chaotic energy present! After Dragon Extinction and the others died, the shattered rules and great paths contained some chaotic energy!"

"Ancient beasts?"

The Immortal Battle Marquis frowned, but the Marquis of Blood Severance was furious, "How could it be ancient beasts! These people each excel in various methods. Chaotic energy... is just one part of it, and it's very likely they're humans!"

The group looked at each other.

Suddenly, someone said, "Remember... the one who wanted to unseal the Hundred Battle King back then?"

Instantly, everyone's expressions changed.

At this moment, the Wind Dragon's bloodline suddenly surged, and it hurriedly said, "The Blood Dragon Marquis, the Blood Dragon Marquis's aura..."

Everyone turned to look at it.

The Wind Dragon hurriedly said, "It's a secret technique of the Dao Treasury. Lords, follow me. It seems the Blood Dragon Marquis left something behind."

Everyone's eyes lit up, and they quickly followed.

Soon, they arrived at the scene where the Blood Dragon Marquis had fought.

The Wind Dragon continuously emitted waves of energy. Moments later, something seemed to appear in its eyes.

Not only it, but the others also gradually sensed something.

In the originally empty void, where only shattered rules existed, faint remnants of will began to appear.

"Chaos Race..."

"Concealment Array..."

"Human race... claiming to be Chaos Race!"

"Claiming to have an extremely noble identity."

"..."

Incomplete pieces of information appeared in everyone's minds.

Everyone's expressions changed slightly.

These were messages left by the Blood Dragon Marquis using a special secret technique before dying.

Did the other side think that by killing the Blood Dragon Marquis, no traces would be left?

Of course, if they weren't of the Dragon Clan, they wouldn't be able to sense these messages.

Now, everyone's expressions changed again.

Chaos Race!

A branch of the human race!

But it seemed they weren't aligned with the current human race.

The group looked at each other. After a long pause, the Marquis of Blood Severance said coldly, "It's that group! Back then, I wondered who those guys were. When the Hundred Battle King was sealed, I wondered what they were trying to do... Over the years, we haven't been able to track them down... But everyone has their suspicions, don't they?"

The Immortal Battle Marquis said solemnly, "Chaos Mountain!"

Everyone's hearts tightened!

Yes, Chaos Mountain.

Chapter 728: The Chaos Clan

The so-called Chaos Clan hails from Chaos Mountain!

Looking at the devastation of the Dragon Clan, Marquis Blood Severance gritted his teeth and said, "What are they trying to do? First, they killed two of our Demon Clan's Daofuse experts, and now they've annihilated the Dragon Clan's quasi-king. Aren't they afraid of being besieged by the myriad races?"

In the distance, a Heavenly King-level expert from the God Clan sighed softly, "Afraid of what? Would you dare to besiege them in Chaos Mountain?"

At this moment, Marquis Blood Severance's face was extremely grim as he said coldly, "Chaos Mountain... it's not truly invincible! Those ancient beasts on the periphery, though strong, can be easily slaughtered if we join forces! Haven't we explored it before? Twenty to thirty Daofuse ancient beasts—can't we kill them?"

Kill them, they certainly could.

The key issue was the unknown situation deeper within, which remained unclear to everyone.

Moreover, how many powerful beings did this self-proclaimed Chaos Clan have?

At this time, Marquis Feng Qi sighed, "This time, a quasi-king has appeared. Back when they went to the Source of Dao to unseal, it was also a quasi-king. The one who plotted against Hundred Battle was also a quasi-king... If they all belong to this clan, then at least... three quasi-kings!"

At least!

These words caused a slight tremor in everyone's hearts.

Perhaps there were even more!

Who exactly were this clan?

Noble in status, the Chaos Clan, plotting against Hundred Battle, rescuing Hundred Battle...

"Now it seems that Marquis Dingjun has been subdued, which suggests this clan might also be a lineage of ancient human experts. Everyone... does anyone come to mind?"

Suddenly, everyone looked towards the Demon Clan. The Immortal Battle Marquis said coldly, "If I remember correctly, in ancient times, the Human Clan's Control King and the Demon Clan's Demon Emperor... had a good relationship."

Marquis Blood Severance said coldly, "What do you mean?"

"What do I mean?"

The Immortal Battle Marquis said sharply, "If we're talking about noble status... I can think of one, the Control King! Shielding formations, sealing the Great Dao, these are all things the Control King was skilled at!"

Everyone had a peculiar expression.

The Control King!

Since ancient times, this Control King seemed to have left no trace.

The Immortal Battle Marquis continued coldly, "Moreover, before the lower realm, we had contact once. There were some issues within the Human Clan, with traitors targeting the so-called multi-divine character faction... Isn't that the lineage of the Culture King?"

Everyone fell silent.

The Control King!

Could it be that this Chaos Clan is the lineage of the Control King?

At this moment, communication between the upper and lower realms was not smooth.

Otherwise, as long as it was confirmed that the traitors in the lower realm were from the Control King's lineage, they could pinpoint that this suddenly emerging, suddenly erupting Chaos Clan was indeed the Control King's lineage!

Marquis Blood Severance frowned and quickly said, "Is this the time to investigate these things? I'm asking you, what do we do now?"

The sudden emergence of so many powerful beings was too worrying!

With the Dragon Clan as a cautionary tale, what should everyone do?

All the powerful beings fell into deep thought.

After a long time, someone sighed, "Convene a Myriad Races Conference, negotiate, station forces near Chaos Mountain, or even... invade Chaos Mountain. Otherwise, this Chaos Clan will become the most destabilizing factor in the upper realm! We don't know their exact strength, their numbers, or their hidden locations. We know nothing about them!"

The unknown is what's terrifying.

Otherwise, if everyone is happily fighting, exterminating the Human Clan, waging wars among themselves, and then the Chaos Clan suddenly wipes everyone out, what then?

The Immortal Battle Marquis said coldly, "Put the matter of Divine Fire Mountain aside for now. If we lose a few more Daofuse experts there, it will be even more troublesome! These Chaos Clan members and the remnants of the Human Clan may not be in cahoots. Hundred Battle was tricked by them, and that fool Marquis Dingjun might have been duped too!"

Silence fell over the group.

Marquis Huoyun, should we put it aside for now?

If not, no one had the mind to besiege it now.

The sudden emergence of the Chaos Clan had put everyone under immense pressure!

At least three quasi-king experts, only the three great clans could match that!
