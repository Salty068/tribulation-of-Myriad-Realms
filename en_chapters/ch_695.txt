Chapter 695: The Scholar's Chain of Contempt

"Terrifying!"

As Su Yu flew out of the Human Realm, he let out a sigh of relief. Truly terrifying. No wonder they insisted on him returning to the Great Xia Prefecture. These people were truly something else, even preparing to leave a legacy for him. It was frightening!

Turning his head to look back at the Human Realm, Su Yu chuckled. "Let my descendants fight another tide? Forget it! I've suffered enough. Why should my descendants have to quell chaos too?"

If he could handle this tide himself, it would solve these problems. If not, there might not even be another tide.

"Time to nurture my path!" Su Yu laughed, disappearing swiftly from where he stood.

...

The Broken Mountain Ox Realm.

This was a race Su Yu was particularly familiar with, though he had never visited before. The race's innate skill was the Mountain Shattering Strike, a technique Su Yu had used many times, even sketching it into his divine text.

At this moment, Su Yu stealthily entered the realm. The Human Race had yet to conquer the Broken Mountain Ox Realm, but it was close. Once the new year passed, the war would resume, and this race would surely be doomed. Of course, they might surrender, as many races were doing now. Only a few stubborn ones refused, having shed too much blood with the Human Race.

At this moment, Su Yu tore through the River of Time, slipping into the void. The only Eternal Realm expert of the Broken Mountain Ox Race quickly arrived, scanning the surroundings with a sense of unease. Could it be that the Human Race had come to attack their realm?

Recently, the Human Race had been attacking the myriad races, plundering resources and slaughtering countless, causing many small realms to suffer greatly. It was truly a time for settling old scores and grievances.

The Broken Mountain Ox Race had also fought against the Human Race. At this moment, the Eternal was filled with worry but was helpless. The Human Race, unrestrained, could invade at will, and the various races had no means to resist.

"Hopefully, they won't attack our realm too soon!" With a hint of trepidation, the Eternal expert took another look around before leaving.

Meanwhile, Su Yu had already stepped into the River of Time. This was the domain of the Broken Mountain Ox Race's River of Time, a place the Human Race couldn't normally enter freely. Each race had its own node in the River of Time.

However, in the Broken Mountain Ox Realm, Su Yu could see the path of this race. Knowing the Mountain Shattering Strike, Su Yu could tear through this race's River of Time.

At this moment, Su Yu cautiously approached a nearby tributary. He intended to steal the power of this race's path, letting their experts nurture his path.

It wasn't feasible to deal with each one individually, and with so few Eternals in this race, Su Yu considered a different approach. Could he directly place a page of his book into the path to steal its power?

Otherwise, how would he steal power from races without strong experts?

"Perhaps by embedding the page directly into the path, it might work!" Su Yu thought, deciding to use the Broken Mountain Ox Race as an experiment.

Standing within the River of Time, Su Yu began to practice the Mountain Shattering Strike. This was the technique and innate skill of the Broken Mountain Ox Race. As Su Yu punched, a divine text appeared, the "Break" character, capable of destroying everything.

The page of the book slowly manifested. The divine text merged into the page, and it seemed as if someone was practicing on it. At this moment, the path of the Broken Mountain Ox Race trembled slightly, as if attracted, wanting Su Yu to merge with it. Su Yu was delighted; it seemed possible!

If this method worked, he would need to learn the techniques of the myriad races, sketch their divine texts, and integrate them into his book. Then, he could use the pages to steal the power of the paths.

"It's just that relying on myself is still not as satisfying as merging into someone else's path and having them nurture it for me!"

There were pros and cons. For instance, by embedding seeds into the paths of Marquis Longblood and others, someone would help Su Yu nurture them, and he wouldn't have to worry. However, it was also easier to be discovered or even backfired upon.

By understanding it himself and then sketching the divine text to integrate, it was a pseudo-merging of paths. The speed wouldn't be too fast, and it would require gradual integration.

Absorbing the power of the path!

"There are pros and cons. These small races are easy to merge with and steal from. But small races also mean fewer strong experts. Even if you embed into their path, an Eternal helping Su Yu merge might not be as fast as Su Yu comprehending it himself."

After all, he was a peerless genius, something the likes of the Broken Mountain Ox Clan's leader couldn't compare to.

"Little Stone... I hope you can be of use!"

Stealing power wasn't about truly merging into the path; otherwise, the conflict between paths would be too great. Su Yu's idea was to use Little Stone to calm the path, suppress it, and then smuggle his book page in, silently integrating it into the path.

At this moment, he took out Little Stone from his pocket. Looking at the path before him, he grimaced, hoping for success. Little Stone could suppress the power of the path.

Taking a deep breath, Su Yu tossed Little Stone towards the tributary. The originally turbulent tributary seemed to sense something, and the power of the path surged, the river boiling, the water violently fluctuating.

But then, Little Stone suddenly emitted a brilliant light!

The turbulent tributary suddenly calmed down.

Su Yu was overjoyed!

He quickly crossed over with his physical body, stepping into the tributary without a word, carefully hiding the book page in a spot, worried that some top experts might sense it.

Although it was almost impossible to see without opening the Heaven Gate, he still had to be cautious. For instance, the Martial Emperor had opened it. If that bastard saw it, what if he tried to steal his book page?

After placing the book page, Su Yu quickly retreated, grabbing Little Stone.

As Little Stone was taken away, the tributary path suddenly shook.

It seemed to sense that something foreign had entered its tributary.

Yet, it also seemed like nothing had entered!

At this moment, Su Yu's book page was like a thief, quietly lurking inside, absorbing the power of the path, rather than merging into it normally.

If Su Yu had forcibly thrown himself in, the path would have retaliated.

But by using Little Stone to suppress the path momentarily, the path didn't sense anything sneaking in. Moreover, the book page itself had some insights into merging, making it seem naturally integrated, quietly slipping in.

Su Yu let out a sigh of relief!

He quickly retreated, wanting to see if this counted as merging. If it did, he should face some punishment.

That would mean the power of the path had actually discovered him.

If not, it meant the infiltration was successful, and the power of the path hadn't noticed his book page slipping in.

Stepping out of the River of Time, Su Yu sensed his surroundings, finding nothing unusual.

No tribulation descended.

Su Yu was overjoyed!

Nothing happened!

Great, this meant he could indeed steal the power of the path.

Opening his Heaven Gate, he looked towards the sky. At this moment, he could vaguely see a path, the path of the Broken Mountain Ox Race. He could also see some small paths surrounding it.

Clearly, this race had more than one Eternal!

But most likely, they were in the Upper Realm. In this realm, there was truly only one Eternal Ox.

Su Yu ignored this, beginning to search for his book page. With his Heaven Gate fully open, Su Yu searched for a long time. On that path, he could vaguely see a page, very small, almost imperceptible.

If it weren't for Su Yu's own senses and his deliberate search, it would be nearly impossible for anyone to notice.

"The only ones to guard against are those who've opened the Heaven Gate!"

"Without opening the Heaven Gate, even if the path senses something amiss, they wouldn't think someone is smuggling in to steal the power of the path!"

"Martial Emperor..."

Su Yu muttered again, feeling the urge to kill to silence him.

He was worried that if the Martial Emperor saw something, once exposed... it wouldn't make a difference. Su Yu mused, whether exposed or not, the myriad races would still want to kill him.

Really!

At this moment, Su Yu stopped thinking about it, looking at the power of the path in the void. With a faint sense of the book page, Su Yu was delighted. After some time, once the Mountain Shattering Path had been absorbed by his book page, he would retrieve the page.

The myriad races, he could try them all!

Visit each one!

In this way, once the Mark of Civilization was unified again, his Mark of Civilization would undoubtedly be terrifyingly powerful.

"Once the Mark of Civilization is powerful, and I merge with the Book of Time, then I'll have enough strength and capital to open my own path!"

How to open it?

Su Yu actually had an idea, not to open it within the River of Time, but separately!

Of course, he had another idea.

To open it on the River of Time, but like the ink path on the Death Path, secretly open a tributary, stealing the power of the River of Time. At a critical moment, he could sever the path, yet still maintain the integrity of his own path!

"The River of Time... the Celestial River of Death... fundamentally, they are the same, interconnected... the Celestial River of Death connects the dead..."

In fact, at this moment, Su Yu had a vague idea.

The Celestial River of Death might not be completely detached from the River of Time!

Perhaps, it was still somewhat connected.

The powerful figure who opened the path back then might have also stolen the power of the River of Time, only to sever it later, treating his own path as the main path.

The reason he thought so was because Su Yu planned to do the same!

"In this way, the strength of the Death Path can be understood. The owner of the Death Path stole the power of the River of Time!"

"And for so many years, why has no one reached the realm of the Lord of Rules... could it be that the River of Time is absorbing the power of the path to repair itself? Or perhaps, the Lords of Rules are still alive?"

These were some of Su Yu's speculations, but he set them aside for now.

He had many tasks ahead.

Visiting each race, he had to be cautious.

Running to ten races a day, visiting a thousand races would take a hundred days.

Time was pressing at this moment.

So, Su Yu had no interest in interacting with the experts of the small realms, even those conquered by the Human Race. He couldn't be bothered to show himself, as it would waste time.

...

Outside.

New Era Calendar Year One.

At this moment, the Myriad Realms were almost devoid of Eternal battles.

In the endless void, a grand hall drifted through the darkness.

Atop the hall, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis sat on the roof, sipping tea and lost in thought, his white robes as pristine as snow. Those who had frequent contact with the Culture King might have picked up this habit, but it was the Topsoil Spirit who was most influenced by the Culture King. In fact, he was the first, or perhaps the only, non-human to serve as a marquis under the Culture King.

A corner of the void was torn open by force.

A cautious head peeked through, and a voice chuckled, "Heavenly Overseer Marquis, enjoying some tea?"

"Rodent."

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis glanced at him and uttered a mild curse. The newcomer, Duobao, wasn't offended. He laughed, "I am indeed a rodent. A Treasure Mouse is still a mouse! If I weren't timid and cautious, how could I have survived until now?"

Duobao chuckled, then quickly added, "Marquis, the Human Race is now dominant. We're both like rats crossing the street, everyone wants to beat us! The Humans come to exterminate us every now and then. I want to surrender, but I can't find a way!"

He continued with a smile, "Marquis, you're an old friend of the Culture King, and you know Doubao too. We're all old friends! The God Devourer Race has a good relationship with the Human Race. Why not act as a mediator and talk to the Humans? Now that the Upper Realm is open, the Humans don't have the upper hand. Why must they drive us to extinction?"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis sneered, showing disdain.

Duobao laughed, "Don't be like that, Marquis. Don't you want to surrender? We can't win, are we just going to our deaths? Since Su Yu became the Human Lord, things have changed rapidly. The Human Race's strength is growing. The Great Zhou, Great Ming, Great Xia, and Great Qin have all reached Daofuse! If this continues, I'm worried the Human Race will produce more Daofuse experts... Su Yu is not someone to be trifled with."

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis sneered again, indifferent.

Duobao sighed, "Marquis, don't just mock. We need to survive! Who's nobler between us? Yes, you're a bit nobler, being a marquis, while I'm just a general. But now, we're both down and out, aren't we?"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis took another sip of tea and calmly said, "The Human Race is strong, and Su Yu is very talented and fortunate! Some things may not have been revealed yet. Recently, I observed the Human Race's fortune... it's terrifyingly strong! The Death Realm has been quiet, perhaps something has happened there too!"

He chuckled lightly, "Not only that, but I've observed the fortunes of other races, and they all seem to be declining. This tide, perhaps the Human Race can truly turn the tables."

"Then why not join me in surrendering to the Human Race, Marquis?"

"Surrender to the Human Race?"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis said flatly, "You wouldn't understand even if I told you... forget it, I won't say more. You can surrender to the Human Race, but I cannot."

"Marquis, are you going to resist to the end?"

Duobao was surprised, then quickly said, "The Hunting Heavens Pavilion doesn't have an irreconcilable enmity with the Human Race! Su Yu dislikes you only because you opposed him. You're powerful, not weaker than anyone. If you were to join Su Yu, he might not hold past grudges against you, especially since you haven't killed any Human experts."

Duobao was still puzzled and thought for a moment before saying, "Are you worried that when the Upper Realm opens, the Humans won't be able to hold their ground, cutting off your retreat? If so, there's no need to worry! Even if the Humans are destined to lose, just the two of us wandering the void might not survive until the Upper Realm opens. We might die in a few years."

"You don't understand!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis shook his head again.

Duobao was confused, "Why?"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis sipped his tea and chuckled, "Do you know why, among the many beings under the Culture King, I alone was appointed as the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, in charge of the Hunting Heavens Pavilion that monitors the heavens?"

"Because you're powerful, Marquis?"

"No, that dog might be stronger than me, yet the Culture King didn't appoint it as the Heavenly Overseer Marquis."

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, "Because I am the Topsoil Spirit! The Culture King... he had plans long ago. If I don't die, how can a new emperor emerge in the Myriad Realms?"

Duobao was still puzzled. What did that mean?

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis took another sip of tea and smiled, "Forget it, you wouldn't understand even if I explained! Originally, I didn't understand either, but later I did! Su Yu won't let me go! Maybe he doesn't understand now, but he will eventually! If he doesn't kill me, how can he become emperor?"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis's smile was radiant, "I've feared the Culture King all my life, even after he's been gone for a hundred thousand years. In the end, I still can't escape his schemes. Scholars, none of them are good!"

He cursed with a smile, "If I don't die, the Human Race... will still lose! If I die, then it's hard to say! If I die, I hope Su Yu can one day meet the Culture King and give him a piece of his mind!"

After laughing for a while, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis didn't explain further. He soon said, "In the short term, I won't die! You, however, should be careful and find a chance to surrender to the Human Race! Don't be clever, hanging around me all the time, thinking that by sticking with me, you won't go wrong. You're overthinking it."

Duobao was embarrassed.

Those words... were true.

He had survived from ancient times to the present, not because of any great skills, but because he had latched onto the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. He always watched where the Heavenly Overseer Marquis leaned and stood on that side.

He was always a winner!

Even if he didn't win, he never lost.

How many ancient marquises were there back then?

How many are still alive today?

And he, a titled general, has lived until now, which is a skill in itself.

Duobao was still somewhat reluctant, "Really not going to surrender to the Human Race with me? Together, we can look out for each other. If you don't go, I don't have the confidence! I've been secretly following you for a hundred thousand years. Except for the first tide when I was unlucky and got severely injured by that bastard Hetu, nothing has happened until now. That's partly thanks to you. If we go together, Su Yu might not refuse us!"

"Idiot."

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, "I told you, you wouldn't understand! You should obediently surrender to the Human Race. This tide, the Human Race has a good chance of winning. Even if they lose, as long as Su Yu is alive, there's still hope!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis thought for a moment and said, "Su Yu is also eyeing the Hunting Heavens List in my hand. According to the legend of the pen, ink, paper, and inkstone... I hold the paper dao! Unfortunately, the Culture King is unwilling to give it to me, and forcing it is meaningless."

With a sigh, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis quickly smiled and said, "We've been old friends for many years. You can't go to the Human Realm empty-handed! I'll give you the Hunting Heavens List. Present it to Su Yu, and even if he doesn't like you, he won't target you anymore!"

With those words, a golden compendium floated towards Duobao.

Duobao was stunned, truly stunned.

"This..."

Are you serious?

He was incredibly surprised. The Hunting Heavens List was the most precious item of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, and he was giving it away. Was there some conspiracy?

Duobao found it unbelievable!

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis chuckled, "You don't understand! Since Su Yu appeared and inherited the pen dao, it was destined that I wouldn't be able to refine this item! How could the Culture King allow an outsider to control his great dao? Impossible! It was my own folly, blinded for several tides! No matter how strong the Culture King's dao is, it's still his dao. Why pursue it so stubbornly?"

With a sigh, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed again, "Giving it to you is also a way to end our many years of friendship! Tell Su Yu that if he wants to kill me, he should come himself! No one else may have the chance to kill me!"

Duobao furrowed his brow and said solemnly, "Marquis, is it really necessary?"

"I told you, you wouldn't understand!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis said impatiently, "It's not like I have no chance! It's not certain that I'll be the one to die. If Su Yu loses, I might have a chance to break free and start anew! However, he and I are destined not to walk the same path. Even if I were to surrender to him... it might be bad for both of us!"

Duobao said nothing, holding the Hunting Heavens List, feeling its mysteriousness, and couldn't help but ask, "Although I don't fully understand, I can sense it's related to fortune! Now that you've given up the Hunting Heavens List, won't your fortune decline further?"

"Perhaps it will be better!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, "Everything has its destiny. This item has actually blinded me for many years. Without it, perhaps... I can soon step into the Heavenly King level!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis chuckled, appearing somewhat carefree, "Both I and Old Turtle, as well as Tiangu, have reached a limit! Su Yu thinks Tiangu is hiding his strength, but I don't think he's hiding it. I think, like me, Tiangu is too obsessed! Of course, he might succeed, but I... am destined to have no hope!"

"Tiangu has been obsessed with the Immortal Emperor's dao for too many years! Back in ancient times, he was a genius of the world, otherwise, everyone wouldn't know Tiangu. Unfortunately, all these years, he's been fixated on it..."

With a laugh, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis continued, "And Old Turtle too, he hasn't seen through it. But with Su Yu around, maybe he'll see through it soon!"

At this point, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis added, "Tell Su Yu, if he wants to kill me, it's best to do so before the Hundred Battle King appears! He's a smart person. Convey my words to him today, and he should understand! The Human Race in this tide has been slow to produce Daofuse experts, their strength has been suppressed. The Human Race is the favored child of the Myriad Realms, how could it be like this? Some things aren't about the great dao..."

After speaking, the Hunting Heavens Pavilion vanished into thin air, leaving behind a group of people.

The voice of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis echoed from afar, "The Western Pavilion Master, the Southern Tower Master, and all the Human members of the Hunting Heavens Pavilion, I return them to the Human Race! No need for suspicion, no need for overthinking. From now on, they have nothing to do with me! The Hunting Heavens Pavilion... should disappear!"

"Marquis!"

Duobao shouted, but in the dark void, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis had long disappeared.

Only a group of unconscious members of the Hunting Heavens Pavilion remained, along with the Hunting Heavens List that the Heavenly Overseer Marquis had pursued for a hundred thousand years.

Faintly, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's sigh could be heard, "Over a hundred thousand years, and only today do I know who I am. How sad, how lamentable. It's better to be a bit foolish. Duobao, I truly envy you fools!"

"......"

Duobao was speechless. Even at the end, he cursed me. Am I foolish?

If I were foolish, could I have survived until today?

What a joke!

Today's Heavenly Overseer Marquis was very strange. Perhaps he really had seen through something. Was this meeting with him a way to end their long-standing friendship?

General Duobao held the Hunting Heaven List in his hands, feeling a momentary urge to embezzle it. The Great Dao! The Paper Dao! This was a path to the Great Dao. However, even the astute Heavenly Overseer Marquis chose to abandon it. Taking it for oneself might mean having it but not living to use it!

"He actually gave it up..." Duobao mused. Could it be that by relinquishing this, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis could truly become stronger? If so, that would be impressive.

"Su Yu must be the one to kill him..." Thoughts swirled in his mind. Forget it, some things were beyond his comprehension. Since the Heavenly Overseer Marquis made such a choice, he might as well follow suit. Perhaps it would indeed save his life.

With a large hand, he grabbed those around him and flew towards the Allheaven Battlefield to find Su Yu. Delivering the Hunting Heaven List should count as a gesture of allegiance, right? Previously, when he wanted to surrender, the Human Race didn't even accept him. He had never seen such an arrogant Human Race. In the Ninth Tide, even Daofuse cultivators were accepted when they surrendered, yet Su Yu was even more arrogant than the Hundred Battle King!

...

Su Yu was unaware of all this. Even though Duobao had come to surrender to the Human Race, and the Human Race had sent several messages to Su Yu, they all vanished without a trace. Su Yu hadn't responded at all.

At this moment, Su Yu was very busy. He continuously infiltrated various small realms, smuggling pages of the Great Dao into the Daos of different races, stealing the power of the Daos.

1,480 pages!

This meant he could steal the power of 1,480 different races. In the Allheaven Battlefield, there were many small races, some so obscure that one wouldn't even know they existed because they were too weak, so weak that they might never have left their realm. They might not even have discovered the passage to their realm.

Currently, Su Yu was in such a small realm. It was very weak! The entire realm didn't even have a Shanhai Realm cultivator; the strongest was at the Lingyun Realm, and even this realm's strongest was unaware of Su Yu's presence nearby. Yet, this realm did possess the power of the Great Dao. Clearly, this might be a newly emerged race, and the Dao might not belong to this race but was left by a previous strong entity of this realm.

For example, in the Fire Pig Race, the previous tide's overlord of the Fire Pig Realm was destroyed, and in this tide, the foolish Fire Pigs became the overlord of that realm. The Fire Pigs were native creatures and occupied the Dao of that realm, but the chances of producing an Eternal were very slim because the Dao didn't quite match their race.

At this time, Su Yu observed this newly discovered race. He had followed the power of the Dao to find them; otherwise, it would have been difficult to discover that there was a small realm in this desolate place. This race resembled gorillas and had developed their own rudimentary civilization. There were remnants and traces from the previous tide or even earlier times, indicating that it was once quite prosperous. However, the race was wiped out, and it was unclear whether these gorillas were newly born or remnants of the original race.

Su Yu wasn't particularly interested in these matters. If the Human Race were to be wiped out, perhaps after many years, it would be the same—a new race occupying the Human Realm, unaware of the past glories. Civilization would start anew, perhaps discovering some relics to accelerate the process and embark on the path of cultivation. But without inheritance, it would be like this realm, where a group of Lingyun could become the rulers of the world, unaware of the strength of the outside world or the myriad powerful races.

The tremors of the heavens might be seen as nothing more than the wrath of the heavens, a natural disaster rather than a man-made calamity.

"It seems pitiful, but as the saying goes, 'If you are not a fish, how can you know the joy of a fish?'" Su Yu chuckled. Perhaps, for them, it was a blessing. Unaware of the myriad realms, they lived their small lives. Even if the powerful of the heavens discovered this realm, they would probably ignore it, just like him. No resources, no strong beings—who would care about this realm?

"Planting the Dao of this realm will use up my pages... It took three months!" This was probably the longest Su Yu had ever spent focusing on one task.

Three months!

Now, it was already the end of March in the first year of the New Yu Calendar!

"I've planted 1,477 seeds, waiting for the harvest!" Su Yu, like a farmer, planted the last page. Of course, there were still three pages left that he couldn't plant—those of the gods, demons, and immortals. These would have to wait.

"Finally done!" Su Yu was exhausted, wanting nothing more than to collapse and sleep. Three months without rest, traversing over a thousand realms, constantly opening the River of Time, contending with the Great Dao, smuggling, stealing—Su Yu was very tired. On busy days, he could traverse 30 realms in a day!

In and out of the River of Time, Su Yu's understanding of the Great Dao had deepened significantly. Now, even without opening the Heaven Gate, he could judge where the Great Dao was, what kind of power it was, and what its general rules were.

His knowledge had grown, experiencing the power of rules in different small realms, witnessing different races, and understanding different cultivation methods. Each smuggling was a process of comprehending the Great Dao for Su Yu.

Planting over a thousand pages into the Great Dao, he had to comprehend an initial Great Dao each time before integrating it. This required understanding and talent. This task was something the Martial Emperor probably couldn't do, even if he had the idea. Not that Su Yu looked down on him, but that person simply didn't have the talent.

"Once I walk the Pen Dao, I might have a breakthrough!" Su Yu chuckled. This was a rare experience, traversing over a thousand realms, practicing over a thousand cultivation methods, witnessing over a thousand races. If he didn't make any progress, it would be unreasonable!

After a brief rest, Su Yu once again tore open the River of Time. He wanted to comprehend the Pen Dao, enhance his strength, and then return to the Human Realm. In the future, the Pen Dao would be his apparent path, while he secretly cultivated myriad Daos.

As Su Yu headed towards the Pen Dao, he thought to himself that if he ever met the Culture King, he would show him the Pen Dao. The Culture King would see it and think, "Oh, just a Pen Dao, too weak. I can take it anytime." Then he would take it, and Su Yu would suddenly reveal his myriad Daos... and with a snap, make the Culture King cry. That would be interesting.

"A great idea!"

"Stick to it!"

"A scholar without trump cards or disguises is nothing!"

"And Dragonblood Marquis, truly impressive. How many death spirits has he devoured? I feel like my Death Spirit Dao is almost stronger than my Pen Dao!"

In just three months, Su Yu sensed a bit. Was Dragonblood Marquis in the Death Realm going mad? Su Yu felt that if he took back the Death Spirit Seed Dao now, he might be stronger than he currently was. That child of destiny in the Death Realm, Dragonblood Marquis, might be close to the Heavenly King level!

He chuckled. Indeed, ambition was the path to becoming a strong individual. Dragonblood Marquis, who was previously at most a fourth-tier Daofuse like Su Yu, now seemed close to second-tier, possibly not weaker than Marquis Lanshan, perhaps even stronger. The number of death spirits devoured was not small!

...

While Su Yu was contemplating these matters, in a dark void, a man in white stood out starkly in the darkness, panting heavily, exhausted yet with a smile. He suddenly turned back, chuckling softly, "The inheritor of the Pen Dao... seems to be thinking nothing good about me..."

With an indescribable elegance, even though he was drenched in sweat and his white clothes were stained with blood, he still wore a radiant smile.

"Only recently inherited the Pen Dao... Indeed, throughout countless eras, they were all fools. Only I am uniquely gifted!"

A soft laugh, carrying a hint of disdain for the world. Throughout countless ages, only now has someone inherited his Pen Dao. Truly wasteful. Unfortunately, it's too late. Only recently inherited the Pen Dao, and although it's not weak, it's not particularly strong either. Even if the other party quickly masters the Pen Dao, it might be too late.

"Too late... To enter the door of my Pen Dao is already a sign of great talent, but alas... too late!"

The man in white chuckled. It would have been better if they had mastered it earlier; perhaps there would have been a chance. Now, it's too late.

"When I developed the Pen Dao to that extent, it took 170 years... Can this person match me?"

He smiled. From the initial opening of the Dao to developing it to immense strength, it took 170 years. The Pen Dao, even among the rulers of rules, could kill most weaker ones. And this person, having only recently merged with the Dao, how many years would it take to master it? Even if mastered, it would only make them a ruler of rules, too weak to be noteworthy.

As he pondered, he suddenly paused. He vaguely sensed something. Oddly, the other party seemed to have suddenly gained insight, and he vaguely sensed that the Pen Dao was suddenly largely mastered by the other party!

Strange!

Apart from the day of merging with the Dao, there had been no movement. Why suddenly gain insight today?

"Could it be that he had set aside my Pen Dao and only thought of it today, then went to merge with it? Impossible... Perhaps he encountered a great opportunity and gained some insight."

The man in white smiled and paid no more attention. He didn't care anymore! Too late! Too slow! It could only be said that the new master of the Pen Dao was unlucky to appear at this time. If they had appeared earlier, there might have been a chance.

"In this myriad realms, no one is more talented than I am. I took 170 years to open the Dao. Even if he doesn't open the Dao, just merging with it, it would be difficult to master it in less than a hundred years!"

With a soft laugh, the man stepped into the void, sweat pouring down, blood gradually staining his clothes red. After fighting for so many years, he was tired, exhausted. That fool Taishan had really screwed him over this time. Indeed, cooperating with fools, pig teammates are always a pitfall.

"Martial fool... trash!"

A low laugh echoed in the darkness, carrying an indescribable arrogance, yet also a hint of helplessness. Trash, but still a teammate, better than none.

...

At this moment, Su Yu's physical body stepped into the Pen Dao. Various insights became clear in his heart, and he moved forward smoothly. On the day he merged with the Dao, he had integrated about 30%, just stepping into the fourth stage of the Eternal Realm. Today, however, he instantly progressed significantly. His "Pen" character divine text covered the Great Dao, 35%, 40%, 50%...

Su Yu's aura grew stronger and stronger! The three-month journey through the myriad realms had finally borne fruit.

Chapter 712: A New Realm

Su Yu had been enveloped in the power of laws, covering over 60% of the Great Dao, before he finally stopped. With a chuckle, he turned and stepped out of the tributary of the Great Dao.

Eternal Seventh Stage!

At this moment, Su Yu had reached the Eternal Seventh Stage in terms of cultivation level. Previously, if he was considered a fourth-tier expert, now he was at least at the peak of the third tier. He wouldn't be weaker than the likes of the Great Qin King!

Reaching the second tier would put him on par with figures like Tiangu, though perhaps trailing slightly behind. However, Su Yu was in no rush.

The Great Dao was about comprehension. His talent far surpassed others, and his insight was exceptionally sharp. With his vast knowledge, it was only a matter of time before he surpassed these old veterans!

"Even if I were to face Tiangu alone now, I could fight him. I might lose, but at least I have the strength to engage in battle!"

Su Yu laughed as he emerged from the River of Time. With another round of accumulation and comprehension, he might formally step into this realm.

"Once I reach 70%, I might possess the power of a second-tier Daofuse. At 80%, perhaps the strength of a Heavenly King? At 90%, a quasi-king? Surpassing 90%, could I contend with some of the ancient physical Dao Human Kings?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. If that were the case, the pen dao wasn't weak at all. Even if it couldn't match the physical Great Dao, it was still quite formidable.

This was merely his own assessment, but Su Yu felt the difference wouldn't be too significant.

"The Great Zhou King and others have sent messages several times, urging me about Duobao's allegiance. Is it really necessary to keep pushing over such a trivial matter?"

Su Yu was speechless, not particularly concerned about Duobao's allegiance. A fifth-tier Daofuse, or even sixth-tier, wasn't something to be overly concerned about. 

Duobao, he had once said, was someone he intended to defeat!

"It's time to return!"

Su Yu wasn't worried about Duobao; he was more concerned about matters in the Upper Realm. After several months, there should be some news about the passage.

This return was more about that concern.

At this moment, Su Yu, dressed in white as pure as snow, carried a hint of fatigue, yet his spirit was high. With an air of elegance, he broke through the boundary and left!

Time to go!
