Chapter 732: Ascending Once More

The first time I ventured to the Upper Realm, it was merely to scout the terrain. The killings were just incidental. But this time, my purpose is clear: to stir things up. Therefore, I need to bring not just any experts, but the elite among the elite.

My goal is to bring all the Heavenly King-level experts with me. However, Old Turtle probably won't be able to join us. Besides, we still need to guard against the Three Realms and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, so some experts must remain to hold the fort, just in case. The Myriad Realms is my foundation, and I cannot afford to lose it.

Thus, I have carefully curated the list of those who will ascend with me this time.

...

In the blink of an eye, three days passed. During these days, everyone was on edge, especially Heavendoom, who was almost burning with impatience. Although he was somewhat weaker, he was a fierce fighter. To prove his strength, he had sparred with Grandstar dozens of times over the past few days. The results showed that he was indeed quite formidable, as Grandstar couldn't gain any clear advantage over him.

On the third day, at the Eastern Rift Valley, within the Emperor Yu's Hall, a group of powerful figures gathered. Compared to a few days ago, their auras had changed, growing even stronger. The map of the Great Dao and the abundant power of laws had not gone to waste.

Naturally, I hadn't been idle these past three days. I took people on walks along the River of Time. Marquis Huoyun, I took him for a stroll. The Great Ming King, I showed him around. Even Doubao was dragged along by me for a spin, though the gains were minimal.

After three days, those who needed to see things had seen them. The map of the Great Dao had been comprehended. At this point, it was up to one's fate. If they could progress, they would; if not, they would have to slowly comprehend or wait for that moment of sudden insight.

In the hall, some were eager to go, some indifferent, some anxious, and some calm.

On the high platform, I glanced around and announced, "Director Wan, Lantian, Great Zhou King, Fat Ball, Marquis Huoyun, all of you will accompany me!"

At these words, many drew in a sharp breath. Taking them all? Had Marquis Huoyun also stepped into the Heavenly King level? Otherwise, I wouldn't have listed him.

General Yingwu and others looked at Marquis Huoyun. He hadn't appeared in the past three days, only showing up today, and his aura did seem stronger. Had he advanced?

Seeing the gazes of his ancient friends, Marquis Huoyun transmitted, "I've barely crossed over. I walk the path of fire, a common Great Dao. After years of accumulation, I've made some gains this time."

After all, he was an ancient figure. At the Divine Fire Mountain, he could battle Heavenly Kings. Now, with the insights from the map of the Great Dao and the journey along the River of Time, I not only showed him his own path but also other fire-related paths.

Marquis Huoyun's gains were decent, but stepping into the Heavenly King level was likely the limit of his years of foundation. Further progress would be challenging.

Hearing this, the other ancient marquises felt a tinge of envy. Marquis Yunshui had also stepped into the second tier, but she was still far from the first-tier Heavenly King realm. At this moment, she transmitted, "It seems Emperor Yu doesn't favor females much."

Her combat strength wasn't weak, but it seemed I preferred Yingwu more. Otherwise, she might have had a chance to step into the Heavenly King realm this time.

I hadn't taken her along the River of Time, which left Marquis Yunshui a bit disappointed.

General Yingwu consoled, "Don't worry. Huoyun only got close to the Heavenly King realm. It's not like a trip along the River of Time guarantees entry into the Heavenly King realm. Look at Doubao; he's not a Heavenly King either."

Well, that was some consolation.

While they chatted secretly, Fat Ball, who was busy knocking on Doubao's head, was a bit anxious. "Do I have to go too?"

I smiled, "Of course!"

"But..."

"No buts!"

I laughed, "I've left the Human Lord Seal behind. Big Wood, Book Spirit, and Tea Plant, I've sent them back. With three Daofuse experts and Big Wood, four Daofuse experts working with my Human Lord Seal, they can hold the fort for three to five months without issue. There are people to water the flowers for you."

Fat Ball wagged its tail, a bit reluctant. It wanted to stay and guard the house!

I chuckled, "If you don't go, it'll be hard for you to grow stronger. Don't you want to one day find your master yourself?"

"…"

Hearing this, Fat Ball was momentarily stunned. I continued, "The Myriad Realms can't be unified anytime soon. I'm afraid I won't have enough time and energy to find the Culture King and the others. The gap in strength is too vast, and even if I search, I won't find them."

Hearing this, Fat Ball nodded reluctantly. Fine, I'll go then.

I smiled, counting Fat Ball and myself, there were now six Heavenly King-level experts!

"Additionally, Doubao, Marquis Yunshui, Shadow Marquis, Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Marquis Dingjun, and General Yingwu, you seven will also accompany me!"

Seven people, all with second-tier Daofuse strength.

As for those not mentioned, like the Fate Emperor, it meant I wasn't planning to take them. The Fate Emperor wasn't surprised; it was normal. Besides, the Fate Realm was also a crucial place, and I definitely needed someone to guard it.

"For the third-tier Daofuse realm, Flatbread, Great Ming King, Marquis Tongtian, and Grandstar, you four will join me!"

Seventeen experts!

Heavendoom was eagerly anticipating, only to hear me laugh, "As for the others, Senior Hongmeng, please oversee the Myriad Realms, guard it with everyone, and take extra care!"

"Fate Emperor, you all stay and guard your realms!"

"As for the Human Realm, Tian Yue and Chongming, your strength isn't too high, but... for now, the Myriad Realms is relatively peaceful. Guard the Human Realm well. If there's trouble, notify the Fate Emperor and Senior Hongmeng promptly."

"If you need to inform me, it's simple..."

I left behind some pages. "If there's danger, break the pages immediately. The Mark of Civilization will have a faint response. Don't use it unless it's urgent!"

Heavendoom was truly anxious, "Emperor Yu, is that all?"

I looked at him.

Heavendoom hurriedly said, "What about below the third-tier Daofuse realm?"

He added, "I'm at the fourth tier now, and I don't feel much weaker than the third tier!"

I laughed, "Your temperament is too impatient. I'm worried you'll cause trouble if you go up."

"I won't!"

Heavendoom quickly said, "Take me! I'll behave!"

I chuckled, then said, "You're not going up there to play. Why are you so eager?"

After thinking for a moment, I said, "Alright, I'll include you. Counting myself, that's 18 Daofuse experts, which should be enough! There's still Jiuyue up there. Too many Daofuse experts leaving the lower realms is already somewhat risky."

I've practically emptied the top-tier experts.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng also spoke, "Emperor Yu, if we draw away all the experts, and if there's a change in the Death Realm, General Hongmeng will have to handle both sides. If Tiangu, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, and others join forces to attack... it could be very dangerous!"

There are still quite a few Daofuse experts left behind. The key is that most of them are guards and some from the myriad races. On the human side, there's only Tian Yue and Chongming.

Doing it this way leaves the defense too weak.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis should have crossed into the Heavenly King realm. Tiangu's side is uncertain, but Jiwu and Demon Halberd are not weak, and there's also the former consort of the God Race, though she might not be able to leave the realm.

I've taken away about 80% of the strength. If something happens, the lower realms might not be able to respond in time.

The Great Zhou King also said, "Your Majesty, perhaps it's better to leave a Heavenly King to guard the Human Realm."

Hongmeng is strong, but he might not be able to free himself.

I pondered for a while and shook my head, "No, the chances of a battle breaking out in the lower realms are low. The upper realms are more likely to see conflict, and it's more dangerous there!"

"As for the lower realms..."

After considering for a moment, I said, "Isn't the Fate Emperor still here?"

Everyone looked at the Fate Emperor, feeling a bit... uneasy!

The Fate Emperor is strong, but the key is... he might not really help the humans in a critical moment.

Seeing the others' gazes, the Fate Emperor slightly bowed and said, "Wuming will do his best!"

I smiled, "General Hongmeng, your main focus is on the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. Fate Emperor, you need to keep an eye on the Three Realms. If there's a change, the Fate Clan might have a way to notify the upper realms and inform me promptly!"

I exhaled, "There aren't enough experts, so this is the best we can do. Without bringing a full team, we might not gain an advantage in the Chaos Mountain turmoil."

Clearly, everyone understood my intentions. I wanted to get involved in the Chaos Mountain battle! And not just in a small way; this time, I might stir up something big.

Six Heavenly Kings, seven top-tier Daofuse experts, and four third-tier Daofuse experts—this force is equivalent to ten Heavenly Kings!

I didn't say anything more and looked at one person, "Duobao!"

"Here!"

General Duobao looked apprehensive. Why call me? My strength is average! And I'm not even human.

I looked at him, "How many council tokens have you collected?"

"Reporting to Emperor Yu, I've collected 11!"

He quickly presented the tokens, and I grabbed them. Now, I had a total of 38 council tokens!

Currently, the three major clans and the Giant Clan haven't been taken down yet. These four, the three major clans, have quite a few council tokens. Together, they might have 20 tokens.

If I collect them all, I'll have more than half.

"Well done!"

"Thank you for the praise, Emperor Yu."

Duobao sighed in relief. I smiled, "Apart from the sealed realms, there might not be any more council tokens in the lower realms."

I looked at General Duobao, thought for a moment, and said, "Your strength isn't great, but your luck is good. Duobao, I have a task for you!"

Duobao was apprehensive, but he braced himself and said, "Emperor Yu, please instruct!"

"If the Heavenly Overseer Marquis doesn't make a move, the forces I've left behind should be enough to guard the Myriad Realms. But if he does, it might not be enough."

"If the Heavenly Overseer Marquis makes a move, it's up to you to delay him, at least until I return, before you can retreat."

"…"

Duobao's face turned a shade of disbelief. Are you serious? Can I really hold off the Heavenly Overseer Marquis? Don't joke!

I laughed, "Don't worry. I see your fortune is prosperous, so it shouldn't be a problem! If you die, it means the Heavenly Overseer Marquis has made up his mind, breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats, because you're destined not to die now."

Is that true?

Despite his doubts, Duobao had no choice but to respond dryly, "I will follow orders!"

"Then it's settled. In two days, we'll ascend to the Upper Realm together!" Su Yu announced to everyone present. "In these two days, go where you need to go, visit who you need to visit. This time, we're going to stir things up in the Upper Realm, and after that, the Myriad Realms might not be as peaceful for us anymore!"

"Understood!"

The crowd dispersed quickly, leaving the grand hall empty.

Su Yu then took out his Mark of Civilization. At this moment, it held many suppressed individuals: the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, the Phoenix Emperor, the Ape Emperor, the Kunpeng, Wen Qi, and the willpower of Marquis Zhennan. As for the various Eternal beings from different races, Su Yu hadn't brought them along; they were still being held elsewhere.

Without addressing the others, Su Yu remained silent for a while. The Mark of Civilization trembled slightly, and soon, the frail figure of Marquis Zhennan appeared.

Marquis Zhennan glanced around, hesitated for a moment, and asked, "This is...?"

"The Lower Realm, East Rift Valley," Su Yu replied.

A hint of nostalgia appeared in Marquis Zhennan's eyes as he looked at Su Yu. After a moment of thought, he asked, "What happened to the Hundred Battle King?"

"He broke free. Whether he escaped or was suppressed again... I'm not sure. At the time, three Heavenly Sovereign-level experts went to deal with him."

Marquis Zhennan took a deep breath. "If he managed to escape, there's hope!"

He didn't dwell on the Hundred Battle King any longer and instead turned his attention to Su Yu. After sensing his surroundings, he was somewhat shocked. "The Lower Realm... seems to have more experts than I imagined."

Su Yu nodded slightly. "It's decent! But compared to the Upper Realm, there's still a gap."

"The Human Lord released me... for what purpose?" Marquis Zhennan inquired.

Su Yu looked at him and asked, "In your eyes, what have we been fighting for over these past hundred thousand years?"

Marquis Zhennan was taken aback.

Su Yu spoke softly, "Is it for the Human Race, for the glory of ancient times, or for the Hundred Battle King?"

Marquis Zhennan remained silent for a long time before he replied, "Half for the Human Race, half for ourselves! As for the Hundred Battle King, he was merely the Human Lord of the Ninth Tide, but his talent was unparalleled, and his strength formidable. He represented the hope of the Human Race at that time!"

Su Yu chuckled, "I'm going to ascend to the Upper Realm again to participate in even greater battles. However, the Human Realm currently doesn't have many strong defenders! Just in case, I want to hide you in the shadows as a trump card. Are you willing to lend a hand at a critical moment?"

Marquis Zhennan squinted. "Aren't you afraid that after you leave, I might..."

Su Yu exhaled lightly. "I am, but... I want to say that the Human Race is not my Human Race!"

"The Human Race is not my everything!"

Su Yu stated calmly, "I protect the Human Race, guard the Human Race, not purely for the so-called responsibility of the Human Emperor. I have my pursuits, my thoughts. If the Human Race truly perishes, or if it perishes at your hands... perhaps, for me, it would also be a kind of relief!"

Marquis Zhennan was stunned, looking at him for a long time before he said bitterly, "You... you're not like the Human Emperor, or... you're not even like the Hundred Battle King."

Su Yu replied calmly, "Perhaps! They were born with certain responsibilities, taught by people like you on what to do next, how to protect the Human Race. The Human Race was their everything. But for me, I'm just fulfilling my responsibility... the responsibility of being born human!"

Su Yu was calm and candid, even somewhat self-deprecating. "A savior, a saint? Sorry, I'm not! It's just that when you have the ability, and your kin are living in misery, facing the threat of extinction, it softens my heart! If I were a bit more ruthless... I wouldn't have to consider so much right now!"

Marquis Zhennan took a deep breath. "My physical body has exploded, and my strength has greatly diminished. Even if I hide in the shadows, it will be difficult to deal with top-tier Daofuse experts."

Su Yu smiled. "Reforming your physical body is all it takes. I'll grant you some power of laws, but... I must remind you, unless the Myriad Races invade the Human Realm, you must not leave the Human Realm! You must not reveal yourself!"

Marquis Zhennan was silent for a while before nodding. "Alright!"

At this point, he looked at Su Yu. "And Wen Qi..."

Su Yu chuckled. "Him? He's just a scheming advisor. If I leave and release him, he might incite you to do something. For now, I won't release him. Isn't he fond of being an advisor? I think he might have some wisdom... If I encounter the Hundred Battle King, or if the Hundred Battle King escapes, I'll let him find the Hundred Battle King!"

"......"

Marquis Zhennan smiled wryly. "You... you want him to find the Hundred Battle King?"

Su Yu nodded slightly. "He might not have many great abilities, but he has plenty of bad ideas, a belly full of schemes, which is a good thing! The Hundred Battle King is too naive. Even if he escapes, he's easily tricked! Bringing along a scheming advisor might stir up some trouble!"

Marquis Zhennan sighed. "Wen Qi isn't a bad person."

Su Yu smiled. "Perhaps you think so, but I don't want to create a rift with the Iron Devourer Race because of this Wen Qi. Do you understand what I mean? Including you, it's the same! Likewise, I want to set an example, to tell the Human Race, to tell our allies, that in my eyes, ability is most important, and being Human doesn't necessarily mean being more important than our allies!"

Marquis Zhennan thought for a moment and nodded. "I understand the Human Lord's thoughts."

"Understanding is best. If not... it is what it is!" Su Yu laughed, casually tossing out some power of laws. "Go to the Human Realm and find a place to hide!"

Marquis Zhennan took it in hand and was about to leave when Su Yu suddenly said, "Wait!"

Marquis Zhennan stopped and looked at Su Yu.

At this moment, Su Yu produced a large sphere. Marquis Zhennan looked at it and was shocked.

"Death aura?"

He looked at Su Yu, noting the immense amount of death aura.

Su Yu nodded. "The necromancer passage in the Human Realm should lead to the Land of the Abyss! Just in case, if something really happens, open the necromancer passage. Even if you're dying, drag the enemy down with you! Now, in the Land of the Abyss, even if those necromancer experts aren't unsealed, there are still dozens of necromancer marquises, and the North King and those Heavenly Kings... they should be able to kill top-tier experts!"

Marquis Zhennan suddenly felt a bit overwhelmed!

He didn't dare to accept it!

He suddenly realized that this Human Lord, whom he hadn't met many times, was truly a madman.

Terrifying!

He even planned that if the Myriad Races truly attacked the Human Realm, he would drag them down with the Human Race.

He swallowed hard, and Su Yu smiled. "What's wrong? Oh, when you open the passage, remember to block the Human Realm's exit, turning it into a dead zone! If that doesn't work, try self-destructing to see if you can collapse the passage from the Human Realm to the Myriad Realms... let all invading enemies die in the Human Realm!"

"......"

Marquis Zhennan's heart was in turmoil. "You... you..."

Su Yu smiled. "What's wrong? I said, when it's a dead end! When it's a dead end, since death is certain, why care so much? Are you going to tell me why we should annihilate the Human Race? Nonsense, it's already a dead end, certain death, isn't mutual destruction better?"

"I'm not crazy!"

Su Yu chuckled. "If I were truly crazy, I would have opened the Human Realm long ago, let the Myriad Races' experts invade, then block the Human Race's exit, open the necromancer passage in the Human Realm, and let the Myriad Races and the necromancer realm battle it out! If the Myriad Races fight me, it's best if I win. If I can't win... the Myriad Races shouldn't expect an easy victory either! Better to be shattered like jade than to be whole like pottery!"

At this moment, Marquis Zhennan was genuinely a bit afraid of this person.

He carefully accepted the death aura, suddenly feeling it as heavy as Mount Tai.

His hands trembled slightly!

He was afraid of breaking the sphere and releasing the countless death aura, leading to the opening of the necromancer passage in the Human Realm, unleashing countless necromancers... that would be the apocalypse!

Marquis Zhennan swallowed hard, looking at Su Yu again, this time with a hint of fear that wasn't obvious.

This guy, if he wins, everyone will be happy.

If he loses... Marquis Zhennan suspected that the Myriad Races would suffer!

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "Marquis Zhennan, the safety of the Human Race in the Lower Realm is entrusted to you! I hope you won't disappoint me! We're not familiar, and I'm entrusting the future of the Human Race to you! Of course, if the Human Race truly perishes... I won't return, and perhaps I can finally break free from this shackle."

At this moment, Marquis Zhennan suddenly said, "You... you might actually hope I'm a traitor, right? The Human Race has now become your burden, hasn't it? If the Human Race perishes, you won't have to guard this weakness anymore..."

"You're wrong!"

Su Yu smiled. "I don't have that thought. I'm just thinking, human strength is limited, and I can't distrust everyone, thinking they're not good people, right?"

Marquis Zhennan smiled bitterly.

Perhaps, Su Yu really hoped he was a traitor.

If the Human Realm were wiped out, Su Yu wouldn't need to care so much. If he wanted to kill, he'd come out and kill a few. If not, he'd find a place to hide, and who could catch him?

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "That's it, go! I'll take my relatives and friends, send them to another realm, open a research institute, do some research, and leave the rest of the Human Race to you!"

"......"

Marquis Zhennan's face grew paler. "This... the Human Lord plans to take his family away?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu smiled brightly. "Would I leave my relatives and friends to you? If you open the necromancer passage, wouldn't they be in trouble?"

"......"

Marquis Zhennan felt even more bitter. "I understand. Rest assured, Human Lord, unless the Human Race truly can't resist and faces extinction, I will never open the necromancer passage!"

Too treacherous!

"Go!"

Marquis Zhennan had no choice. His figure flickered and disappeared from the spot.

Moments later, Wan Tiansheng entered, smiling. "You scared him terribly."

He then asked meaningfully, "You wouldn't... really have that plan, would you?"

This kid, Su Yu, had a dark heart.

If he really had that plan... he couldn't help but ask, "That sphere, it won't explode on its own, will it?"

Su Yu rolled his eyes. "Principal, what do you mean by that?"

"If Marquis Zhennan heard this, wouldn't he be scared to death?"

In the distance, Marquis Zhennan, who had just left, suddenly twitched his ears, his face turning pale. He quickly glanced at the sphere and, gritting his teeth, absorbed it into his sea of will. If it exploded in there, it would first blow up his sea of will! Terrifying! He realized that this current Human Lord was truly fearsome, a devil!

...

Once Marquis Zhennan had completely disappeared, Su Yu chuckled. Wan Tiansheng also laughed, "You really scared him! Now, whether he leans towards the Human Race or anyone else, he probably won't dare to act rashly. The Human Race has become a shackle that restrains us."

Su Yu grinned, "I don't think that way. I believe he's a good person. I trust him!"

Wan Tiansheng smiled without commenting further. Even if Marquis Zhennan was aligned with the Control King's lineage, he likely wouldn't dare to make any reckless moves now.

Wan Tiansheng didn't dwell on the topic and asked, "Are you serious about the research institute?"

Su Yu nodded, "Of course! I'll establish two, one in Grand Dream City and another in the Death Realm. I want everyone to help me deduce the Great Dao: one becomes two, two becomes three, and myriad paths converge into one. The students of the Culture King will be stationed under Grand Dream City, led by Hetu. As for the institute above, I'll gather some Human researchers to work on it..."

"My teacher Bai Feng, as well as Wu Lan and Master Hong Tan, are all skilled in such research."

Su Yu smiled, "Researching the Great Dao is also a form of cultivation. Placing them in Grand Dream City is somewhat safer."

"Arrange it as you see fit!"

Wan Tiansheng pondered for a moment and said, "I have a question. Think it over carefully and give me an answer."

"Please go ahead, Principal."

"How do you plan to deal with Hundred Battle?"

He looked at Su Yu, speaking solemnly, "You haven't helped other Humans switch paths. Those who walk the path of the physical body are mostly still on that path! You haven't mentioned switching paths or how to advance to the Daofuse Realm... What are your thoughts?"

Su Yu laughed, "The old path of the physical body was enough to accommodate multiple Human Lords. One Hundred Battle is not even on par with a Human Lord... So the physical body path itself is severely damaged and needs to be repaired."

Wan Tiansheng said seriously, "Speak honestly, don't brush me off! Are you planning to kill Hundred Battle? If you kill him, those on the physical body path might instantly step into the Daofuse Realm. Is that your intention?"

Since Su Yu stopped mentioning Hundred Battle and how to deal with him, Wan Tiansheng had been pondering whether Su Yu had made up his mind to kill Hundred Battle. Otherwise... Su Yu hadn't really talked about how to help other Humans advance to the Daofuse Realm.

Was he waiting for such an opportunity?

Su Yu was silent for a moment, "It's hard to say now. I don't necessarily want to kill him! But... even if I don't kill him, Hundred Battle had better be sensible and yield the power of the Great Dao to me! Whether he switches paths or does something else, I don't care! But since he made a grave mistake, he needs to take full responsibility! His path was given to him by some Daofuse experts back then, so he needs to give it up again!"

Yes, that was Su Yu's intention. Even if he didn't kill him, his path had to be relinquished! Relinquish it so others could step into the Daofuse Realm! One Hundred Battle occupied a significant amount of the power of the Great Dao. Giving it up might allow ten or even more to enter the Daofuse Realm.

Wan Tiansheng exhaled, "Even if he relinquishes it, and others enter the Daofuse Realm, they might not be as strong as him."

"That's not important!"

Su Yu shook his head, "Even if ten Daofuse experts aren't as strong as him, or even if ten Heavenly Kings might not be able to match him... so what? He is him, and my people are my people."

"Alright, I understand your thoughts now!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "I know what to do. This matter... you don't need to mention it yourself. I'll convey it to some people."

Su Yu said nothing, merely nodding slightly.

Wan Tiansheng soon disappeared.

...

In the following two days, Su Yu was extremely busy. On one hand, he needed to establish the research institute, and on the other, he had to arrange various matters across different realms. Additionally, he had to walk through the River of Time and bury some pages.

...

It wasn't until the third day that Su Yu barely finished these tasks.

Torchbearer Passage.

Including Su Yu, a total of eighteen top-tier experts were present.

"This time, there's no need to leave anyone to guard the passage!"

Su Yu smiled, "If this place gets blocked, whoever comes to block us from the lower realm will die! If there's really no other way, we can leave through other means!"

Unlike last time, Su Yu was worried about accidents. This time, with preparations in place, he didn't plan to leave anyone to guard the passage. It would be a waste of combat power!

Everyone was excited, especially Heavendoom, who eagerly asked, "Can we start killing as soon as we go up?"

"......"

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to respond to him. He glanced at the passage entrance, which appeared only once a month. It had been almost a month since he last entered the Upper Realm. Of course, in reality, it was still a few days short. But for Su Yu now, he didn't need to wait for the passage to appear.

Less than a month later, returning to the Upper Realm marked a new beginning for Su Yu.

The Starry Sky Seal emerged, striking towards the sky.

Soon, a passage appeared in the air.

"Let's go!"

Su Yu stepped in, and the others followed suit. This time, they were all top-tier experts, and the minor dangers within the passage were not significant to them. They easily passed through.

...

At the same time Su Yu and his group ascended to the Upper Realm again.

Bamboo Mountain.

Marquis Giant Bamboo and others once again looked towards September.

Ten days!

It had been ten days since Su Yu and his group disappeared.

There was no news at all!

And during these ten days, the Upper Realm had been somewhat chaotic.

The first Myriad Race Conference had already been held, but it wasn't very successful.

At this moment, several Iron Devourer Beasts looked towards September, and Marquis Giant Bamboo said gravely, "March is about to return. In recent days, the Myriad Races have been pressuring March to take a stand, even inviting our race to participate in the Myriad Race Conference several times! If Su Yu and his group don't return soon... if something really happened, the Iron Devourer Race might have to make a different choice under these circumstances!"

September was also anxious. Ten days had passed, and Su Yu and his group hadn't appeared. Where had they gone?

He was certain they were alive, but where were they?

Just as he was about to speak, outside Bamboo Mountain, a powerful Immortal Marquis called out loudly, "The Myriad Race Conference invites the Iron Devourer Race to participate! Three days from now, the second Myriad Race Conference will be held at Ren Mountain! Will the Iron Devourer Race attend?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo soared into the sky, looking outside the mountain, and said foolishly, "Well... we'll decide when our March Clan Leader returns."

After speaking, he chuckled foolishly, "By the way, which races haven't confirmed their attendance yet?"

The Immortal Marquis replied indifferently, "The Fate Clan, Ancient Giant Race, Iron Devourer... only a few races haven't confirmed yet! Marquis Giant Bamboo, I still have to notify other races. Your race... take care!"

With that, the Immortal Marquis vanished instantly!

Marquis Giant Bamboo's foolish smile disappeared, replaced by a heavy expression.

Watching the departing figure, April said solemnly, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, that guy is quite arrogant..."

Marquis Giant Bamboo replied gravely, "It's not about arrogance. I'm worried."

"Worried about what?"

"I'm worried that if our race doesn't go, they might target us before dealing with Chaos Mountain..."

"My father is still here..."

Marquis Giant Bamboo sighed, "Don't be naive. If the Myriad Races truly reach a consensus to deal with Chaos Mountain, and the strength of Chaos Mountain is still unclear, they won't allow us to sit back and watch. They won't permit us not to participate."

"Then let's participate!"

April said solemnly, "We'll attend the conference!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo said helplessly, "If we participate, we'll be the vanguard!"

April's face changed as he looked at Marquis Giant Bamboo, who nodded, "Don't look at me. That's the result! The Myriad Races aren't fools. If our race goes to muddle through, will they agree? Not just our race, those who have had close dealings with the Human Race, even if they participate, are likely to be the vanguard!"

"Now we're in a dilemma!"

With a sigh, Marquis Giant Bamboo said helplessly, "Our strength isn't enough. Not participating is dangerous! Participating is also dangerous! Not to mention, the three major races are much stronger than ours! Now, the three major races are leading the Myriad Race Conference. Even if other races are unwilling, if the three races make our race the vanguard... those guys would be eager for it, as it would avoid some losses!"

At this moment, they were truly in a dilemma!

Marquis Giant Bamboo sighed again, "The Human Race... I don't know what's going on. If Emperor Yu doesn't come, we won't know how to proceed! March is also being watched by several other Heavenly Sovereigns. March can't act rashly. Any slight movement... might trigger the nerves of the three major races."

Now, April was also filled with melancholy.

Soon, the mood spread, and May also sighed, while Full Moon looked worried. By the time it reached September, he was also full of helplessness. Three days later... if Emperor Yu doesn't come, the Iron Devourer Race might have to be the vanguard!

Otherwise, the Myriad Races might first eliminate the Iron Devourer Race as a hidden threat.

September was extremely troubled, "If Emperor Yu doesn't come, why doesn't Hundred Battle come either? If Hundred Battle comes... we could coax him into attacking Ren Mountain! If he attacks Ren Mountain, the conference won't be held, and it might buy us some time!"

"......"

Several Iron Devourer Beasts looked at him.

What a scoundrel!

Such a black-hearted guy!

How did our Iron Devourer Race produce such a black-hearted fellow?

He hoped for Hundred Battle to come, just to coax him into attacking Ren Mountain. This... was truly black-hearted!

...

At the same time.

On the edge of Chaos Mountain, beneath a desolate land, Hundred Battle King was healing, trying to break the seal. Yet, a chain always appeared, entwining his power of the Great Dao.

Hundred Battle King's eyes blazed with fury!

Moon Luo!

Why can't I break this chain?

Hundred Battle King gritted his teeth, his eyes flashing with cold light.

Moon Luo, you vile woman!

I'll kill you!

And those bastards of the Myriad Races, if it weren't for my sealed strength and the inability to fully exert the power of the Great Dao, could those like Demon Heaven even hurt me?

Hundred Battle King was seething with anger. At this moment, a faint sense of crisis arose in his heart. He snorted coldly, "Who dares to think of harming this king? Come if you dare!"

...

Meanwhile, several hundred miles away, a figure emerged. Clad in a black robe that concealed everything but a pair of eyes, the figure exuded an aura of endless fragility.

"Hundred Battle... Moon Luo misses you."

A gentle laugh echoed softly, carrying an indescribable mix of delicacy and allure.

Hundred Battle King seemed to be nearby.
