Chapter 788: Siblings Reunited

With the capture of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, Su Yu felt a sense of relief. Others might seek to break the seal and ascend to the rank of a ruler of laws, but they would have to find their own way. There were certainly more than one path to take. Could they emulate Xingyue and directly reverse the flow to break through the seal? Or perhaps, like Su Yu, create their own world to shield themselves from the influence of the River of Time? Alternatively, they could walk the path of chaos to avoid it altogether. There were many possibilities!

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis was not the only route. However, killing him was the simplest and most direct approach.

The South King and others ventured deep into the chaos, exploring the path to Chaos Mountain. Su Yu, not wanting to delay, decided he must also go and see for himself. He was certain he could reach it, though he was unsure of the dangers along the way.

Soon, Su Yu bid farewell to Wan Tiansheng and the others, taking a step into the chaos to seek the path to the Upper Realm.

...

At the same time, within the River of Time.

Xingyue, having broken through, found her strength increased by threefold. She continued forward, uncertain of where her brother and the others were, but she felt she was close to seeing them again.

It had been so many years!

Since becoming a necromancer, her power had been sealed, and her memories were fragmented. Now, perhaps, she would meet them once more.

As Xingyue felt both excitement and worry, she recalled the moment of her rebirth when her bloodline sensed that her brother's true body seemed gravely injured. How had he survived all these years?

And what had happened to Wenyu back then? Why had he suddenly vanished, falling into peril, causing the Culture King and others to leave, plunging the Myriad Realms into chaos?

Wenyu, the Time Sage, was also her playmate. Wenyu was even younger than her, and they had known each other for many years, long before the unification of the realms, often playing together. Later, she fell, losing her memories, and she wasn't sure what had become of Wenyu.

However, as a necromancer, she knew some things about the Time Sage. Su Yu seemed to be the heir of the Time Sage, meaning Su Yu was essentially Wenyu's successor.

With these thoughts in mind, Xingyue pressed on. As a healer, if she could find the Human Emperor and the others, she might be able to buy Su Yu and his group some time. Otherwise, if they returned too early, all being rulers of laws, how could Su Yu's group, not yet fully grown, contend with hundreds of rulers of laws?

She moved forward, suppressing her despair. How had she not reached them yet? The Xingyu Imprint had already run out of energy! Without this seal, she wouldn't have been able to come this far. But now, the seal's energy was depleted, and Xingyue could only continue extracting life force to pave the way forward. Otherwise, she wouldn't reach the end.

As a healer, her other methods were limited. Xingyue thought that if Su Yu were here, he would surely have many methods. That guy always had strange and varied techniques.

"If I can't find them soon... I might be swept back downstream!"

"If I get swept back, I might be severely injured, sealed again, or even fall... Then this rebirth would have been in vain!"

Moreover, if she fell here, Su Yu's path of life and death would be severed.

As these thoughts flickered through her mind, Xingyue felt exhausted and desperate. Had she not reached them yet? She had already crossed her brother's sealed area. Why hadn't she arrived yet? How far away were they?

Was Su Yu's information reliable? He said the Human Emperor and the others were upstream. That was what Su Yu said. Was he reliable? Could it be that they weren't upstream at all?

Just as Xingyue was feeling utterly worn out, a low voice echoed in all directions: "Who goes there?"

Xingyue's spirit lifted!

Someone was there?

She looked up into the distance, where the power of numerous great daos stood tall. In the distance, the River of Time had also undergone some changes, becoming solidified, even turning into land!

Xingyue instantly understood!

They had solidified the River of Time to slow down the return to the Myriad Realms. So, this was how they had been fighting all these years. They had sealed the River of Time, preventing others from returning.

As she pondered this, three incredibly powerful auras rose up in an instant. This was the rear! This was also a defensive line! To prevent anyone from coming from behind, and to prevent anyone from deserting!

Who had arrived?

At this moment, Xingyue was shaken, and the owners of those three beams of light were also shocked.

Someone had come from the rear!

This meant that this place might not be too far from the Myriad Realms. If they delayed any longer, they might completely merge with the Myriad Realms, and there would no longer be any separation. Once that happened, the blockade would be useless!

Because at that moment, the River of Time could be torn apart at will.

Now, it was impossible to casually become a necromancer. With the Myriad Realms not aligned, tearing the river would lead one to an unknown destination, likely falling into endless chaos, completely disappearing or perishing.

Both sides stood in confrontation!

In an instant, three great powerhouses descended, two men and one woman, all appearing very old.

They might have been young once.

But after years of fierce battles, they had no strength left to maintain their youthful appearances. Their life force and power of laws were being consumed, and the three top-tier powerhouses appeared somewhat aged.

The three looked at Xingyue, frowning slightly.

Among them, a man with long green hair looked at Xingyue, frowning slightly. She seemed familiar, but he couldn't recall who she was at the moment.

It had been too long!

Xingyue had fallen so many years ago, so long that even some of the Human Kings didn't recognize her. Xingyue was one of the earliest powerhouses, from the era when the Human Emperor first rose to power.

At this moment, Xingyue also looked at the three. She didn't know two of them, but she recognized the green-haired elder at a glance. Her expression was complex as she spoke after a long pause, "General Xuantian!"

What a distant term!

What a distant title!

General Xuantian!

At this moment, the green-haired elder was in a daze. In an instant, he remembered!

His memories resurfaced.

He recalled events from many, many years ago. That day, he saw her hiding behind the Human Emperor, timidly greeting him, "General Xuantian!"

That smile, he still remembered.

"Your Highness..."

The green-haired elder murmured, suddenly losing control, his eyes filled with complex emotions. "You... you are Your Highness? No, impossible! Your Highness died in battle. Who are you? Speak, who are you!"

Her Highness had died in battle!

The Human Realm had just been unified, and peace had not yet been achieved when she died in battle, assassinated!

The princess who sometimes came to the barracks to aid wounded soldiers died on the eve of victory.

Most of the old soldiers from that period had died in battle. There weren't many left who remembered the princess.

Xingyue had been dead for many, many years!

"It's me!"

Xingyue's emotions were also complex. "General Xuantian, I... have been resurrected!"

"Impossible!"

General Xuantian was somewhat out of control. Beside him, the female powerhouse couldn't help but say, "King Xuan!"

General Xuantian instantly regained his composure!

The next moment, his eyes turned cold and sharp. "Who are you really?"

After so many years, someone dared to impersonate the princess!

Xingyue was a bit helpless. "It's me, I really am Xingyue, I've been resurrected!"

Seeing his disbelief, she had no choice but to say, "I don't remember how many years ago... It was probably when you were attacking the western lands of the Human Realm. You were injured once, shot through by an arrow... in the thigh. I was the one who saved you. Do you remember?"

General Xuantian recalled, his eyes showing a strange light. Xingyue, seeing his silence, grew anxious. "It was that time when the arrow pierced your thigh, the arrowhead was slightly off, and it pierced through your buttocks... I didn't want to save you. My brother said to treat it like pork, and that's why I saved you that time..."

"......"

King Xuan's face changed, disbelief written all over it. "You... really are the princess?"

"It's me!"

Xingyue was helpless. "If you don't believe me, let me think if there's anything else..."

"No need!"

King Xuan stopped her!

But Xingyue softly continued, "Yes, there was another year when General Xuantian was attacking the southwest and was bitten by a poisonous insect. You were on the verge of death, and when you saw me for the last time, you actually... actually asked me to find you a woman, saying that if you slept with someone before dying, it wouldn't be a loss... After I saved you, you denied ever saying that. Do you remember that time, General?"

"......"

King Xuan's face stiffened, and he dryly said, "No, right? Your Highness, you must be mistaken!"

The next moment, he didn't let Xingyue speak any further and suddenly shouted, "The princess has returned!"

His voice was like a great bell!

Whether true or false, he decided to call the emperor first. Damn it, stop talking.

I don't know you!

You've got the wrong person!

Beside him, the two top-tier powerhouses looked at him with some strangeness. General Xuantian!

That was indeed King Xuan's title from long ago!

However, since he was crowned king many years ago, almost no one called him General Xuantian anymore.

The key was, were the words of this woman true or false?

Two injuries, one piercing the buttocks, and one asking to sleep with a woman before dying... Was this really King Xuan?

In their eyes, King Xuan was a big brother figure.

He had always been serious!

King Xuan was an old subordinate of the Human Emperor from the early days. Most of the old soldiers from that period had died in battle. A few, like the Human Kings of the Four Extremes, were still alive. The remaining survivors were all at the level of Human Kings.

Now, this big brother seemed to have had quite a few stories back in the day.

The robust man beside King Xuan, feeling a bit strange, transmitted, "King Xuan, who is this...?"

Your Highness?

That title was also very old.

The Human Emperor had no heirs, and almost no one could use that title.

Who was this?

Was she related to the emperor?

While they were pondering these things, figures began to appear, and those who didn't appear also probed with their willpower. The next moment, someone exclaimed, "Xingyue?"

Xingyue looked toward the direction of the willpower vibration, not seeing anyone, but feeling somewhat familiar. She tentatively asked, "General Zhu Ming?"

"It's really you!"

The willpower vibrated intensely. "Has Old Wen returned? Have you been resurrected?"

It was the voice of the Radiant King, trembling with excitement. "You... your brother is patrolling the front lines and will be back soon!"

As he spoke, his figure instantly appeared!

In an instant, he was present before everyone.

The man was a charming, slightly overweight elder, but it didn't detract from his appearance. He carried an air of carefree elegance, though at this moment, he seemed somewhat shocked and pale. "Xingyue, you've truly come back to life!"

Xingyue also saw him, her gaze complex. "General Zhu, you've aged!"

Aged?

The Radiant King was taken aback. It was the first time someone had told him he was old. Quickly, a bitter smile appeared on his face. Yes, he was old. 

Back in the day, when he first met Xingyue, he was still young. He was just a dashing young man then! In the blink of an eye, countless years had passed.

With a mix of emotions, he walked towards Xingyue. "Are you really Xingyue?"

He couldn't believe it! Of course, a thought arose in his mind: the Culture King must have returned! Otherwise, how could Xingyue be resurrected? If the Culture King and the Martial King were back, what was there to fear from the myriad races? 

The Culture King and the Martial King together could take on seven or eight rulers of the power of laws! In fact, throw ten rulers at them, and those two madmen could still handle it! Back then, it was because of people like them that the Myriad Realms were deterred, laying the foundation for the Human Race's dominance. Unfortunately, it all eventually fell apart.

Xingyue's gaze was equally complex as she nodded. "It's really me! Brother Zhu, I've been resurrected! If you don't believe me, you can ask me questions... or... ask your wife. Back when you met her, I played a role... Have you forgotten? To pursue her, you deliberately injured her father and secretly ambushed her brother, causing their injuries. Later, you asked me to heal them. I noticed the injuries seemed to come from you, and you told me not to say anything..."

Silence!

The surroundings fell into a deep silence.

The Radiant King was stunned, looking at Xingyue, speechless for a long time. 

At that moment, a bone-chilling aura rose. "Zhu Ming, is this true?"

"..."

The Radiant King's expression shifted rapidly, and he quickly said, "This person isn't Xingyue, she's a fake!"

He shouted in a low voice, "Or maybe she's been dead for too long, and after being resurrected, her memories are jumbled, confusing my affairs with someone else's!"

I won't admit it!

I've hidden this matter of ambushing my father-in-law and brother-in-law for so many years, and now someone is digging up my past! My goodness! I can't admit it; my fierce wife is still alive.

Around them, everyone exchanged strange glances.

Was this... true?

At this moment, the Dark King sighed in relief. No one remembered his past, right? Terrifying! And to think Old Zhu did something like this? How shameless! No wonder he won the beauty's heart; he did it by injuring his father-in-law...

The Dark King's expression changed as he recalled, "Could it be that time?"

He suddenly looked at the Radiant King, shocked. "Was it that time when you took the opportunity to drive away General Yusheng, claiming he failed to protect them, but you actually did it to get rid of a rival?"

"..."

Gossip!

A group of powerful figures quickly listened in. What kind of gossip was this?

Some elders remembered and whispered, "Probably... it was a long time ago. The Radiant King was still a general then. There was a handsome General Yusheng who also pursued the Radiant King's consort. Later, during Yusheng's watch, the consort's family was robbed, losing many treasures, and even her father and brother were injured by the thieves... Later, General Yusheng withdrew due to his failure to protect them..."

"..."

Black-hearted!

Many looked at the Radiant King, whose face was stiff. After a long time, he couldn't help but curse, "What are you looking at! Nonsense! None of that happened! Yusheng withdrew on his own!"

Saying this, he turned to look at a woman rushing over from afar. Though she was somewhat aged, she was still beautiful. The Radiant King grumbled, "Don't believe them, it's all lies!"

Seeing the woman charging over with a fierce aura, the Radiant King panicked and quickly said, "Don't come over! Later, to compensate your father and brother, I promised to elevate the Sea of Stars, and the land beneath it was granted to your father and brother... Otherwise, do you think I would have bothered to elevate the Sea of Stars?"

The woman was startled, then furious. "What? You elevated the Sea of Stars not because I liked watching the sea in the sky?"

"Nonsense!"

The Radiant King jumped, "How could that be! Do I have that much free time? Your father and brother knew about the past and forced me to give them some benefits. I thought about it and had no place to grant them, so I elevated the Sea of Stars. The land beneath it is vast, and I granted it all to your family!"

"..."

Everyone exchanged glances, each with a peculiar expression.

Fairy tales are lies!

Beautiful love stories are fake!

It was rumored that the Radiant King elevated the Sea of Stars because the woman he loved liked watching the sea in the sky. So, he spared no effort, using great formations and power of laws to elevate the entire Sea of Stars!

Now... my goodness!

The truth was revealed!

It wasn't for the consort but because his father-in-law and brother-in-law had no place to be granted, and he had no choice but to elevate the Sea of Stars, granting the land beneath it to his in-laws!

My goodness, it shatters one's worldview.

Love stories are all lies!

The Radiant King's consort was furious. "You're lying! My father and brother have been dead for years, and you still want to frame them?"

"It's true!"

The Radiant King shouted, "I'm not lying. Your father and brother knew, and Yusheng found out later too. He even asked me for benefits. Otherwise, how do you think he got a marquis title posthumously? He was dead, and I still got him a marquis title!"

"You scoundrel, I'll kill you!"

Boom!

The woman struck him with a palm.

The Radiant King immediately fled, escaping to Xingyue's side, whispering in a low voice, "My dear sister, you've killed me! These are ancient matters, and you brought them up!"

What was this?

Xingyue was also stunned, unable to help but say, "Sister-in-law... wasn't she very gentle before?"

"My goodness, how many years has it been?"

The Radiant King held his forehead. My dear sister, do you know how many years have passed? You still think it's like back then! She's long become a fierce wife!

Xingyue looked awkward. Had things changed so much? Sister-in-law had become a fierce wife? Terrifying!

Chaos ensued!

After a while, a figure appeared, somewhat illusory.

Although it had been guessed before, at this moment, the shadow still trembled, filled with disbelief, mixed with joy and bitterness. "Xingyue... you're... alive again!"

"Brother!"

Xingyue burst into tears, looking at the shadow with some trembling.

At this moment, the surroundings quieted down. The Radiant King's consort, who had been beating him, also stopped, wiping her eyes with his clothes, whispering, "So touching, Sister Xingyue is finally resurrected!"

The Radiant King was helpless. You're moved? If you're moved, at least let me go first. What kind of decorum is this!

The Human Emperor stepped forward, filled with joy and excitement. "You... truly came back to life!"

"Back then, I didn't want you to fall. I hoped to revive you after I opened the heavens, but... I was tricked, and had no choice but to give up. I thought you'd live in a daze forever, but... you're alive!"

He was incredibly excited!

Xingyue was equally thrilled. Reunited with her brother, she rushed forward, trying to grab the shadow's clothes, but her hand passed through, and she burst into tears. "Brother, where is your true form?"

"Injured a bit, just minor wounds, nothing serious!"

The shadow patted her head, comforting her. "It's just minor wounds. Don't worry. Your revival is the best news I've heard in years. I didn't expect you'd come looking for me. I sensed some changes earlier, thought I was mistaken, but didn't expect you were truly alive!"

Xingyue nodded, equally excited.

The siblings, looking at each other, cried and laughed.

Excitement and joy filled the air.

Soon, the Human Emperor thought of something, excitedly asking, "Do you still wield the power of life?"

"Yes!"

Xingyue nodded, and the Human Emperor was overjoyed. Heaven is truly helping me.

"Xingyue, you... indeed, the heavens are aiding me!"

At this moment, his sister was resurrected!

Not only that, but she also wielded the power of life to aid them, like a divine blessing!

Everyone was instantly excited upon hearing this.

The power of life?

The emperor's sister wielded the power of life; this was indeed a heavenly blessing for everyone!

After years of battle, who wasn't injured?

Some injuries couldn't heal on their own, even if they could, it would take too much time. Especially the depletion of life force, which was hard to replenish. Now, Xingyue was here!

Didn't that mean everyone could heal their injuries?

In the battle against the myriad races, they hadn't initially been at a disadvantage.

But on the other side, the Immortal Emperor was adept at the power of life. As a result, one side was barely holding on, while the other had someone to heal their wounds. Multiple attempts to ambush the Immortal Emperor had failed, resulting in heavy losses. The Human Emperor's severe injuries were also related to the ambush attempts.

In war, not killing the healer meant the side without one would eventually fall behind.

Over the years, this had been proven!

In a war of attrition, they were indeed inferior to the other side.

But now, the Human Emperor's sister wielded the power of life, bringing immense morale!

"How are the Myriad Realms now?"

"Who resurrected you?"

"..."

At this moment, everyone had countless questions, but seeing the reunion of the Human Emperor and Xingyue, they refrained from asking.

However, the Radiant King couldn't help but ask, "Did the Culture King return? Why hasn't he come here?"

This question stirred excitement in everyone.

Was it the Culture King?

Was the Martial King here too?

If both returned, everyone would be ecstatic. They could fight the myriad races again, just like in the old days!

"No, Brother Wen hasn't returned!"

Xingyue shook her head, feeling a bit helpless as she noticed the expectant gazes of those around her. She understood what everyone was hoping for, but... the Su Yu who resurrected her was still quite weak. Offering hope now might only lead to despair later.

She quickly said, "My resurrection was a matter of chance..."

The Human Emperor seemed to have thought of something and asked in a deep voice, "Did someone open the heavens?"

"Yes."

This time, Xingyue didn't hide it, but she added, "However, he opened the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm, so his strength isn't great."

"......"

A group of people were stunned, and even the Human Emperor's shadow trembled.

What the heck?

Sunmoon Realm opening the heavens?

Indeed, Su Yu hadn't reached the Daofuse Realm before opening the heavens, so he was naturally just at the Sunmoon Realm. Upon hearing this, the Human Emperor couldn't help but say, "How is that possible!"

So weak, yet he opened the heavens and didn't die?

That's not normal!

I mean, without a master of the laws, how could he open the heavens? So, he simply opened the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm!

Initially, everyone had some expectations, but upon hearing this, they felt a bit helpless.

Doesn't that mean it's useless?

Even if he succeeded in opening the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm, how strong could he be?

Daofuse?

Quasi-king?

Or what?

In any case, he couldn't possibly become a master of the laws overnight. It wouldn't be that fast. How much understanding of the Great Dao could someone at the Sunmoon Realm have?

Someone couldn't help but ask, "Do we know him? How old is he?"

"How old?"

Xingyue was taken aback, then quickly said, "Just over 20?"

"......"

Despair!

Forget it, there's no hope.

He's too young. We thought he might be an old ghost who had accumulated power for many years, but it turns out he's not.

Someone quickly asked, "So, is there no master of the laws in the Myriad Realms now?"

"There are a few!"

Xingyue quickly replied, "The Undead Emperor, the Martial Emperor, and the ancestor of the Control King lineage..."

The crowd had mixed reactions.

Someone curiously asked, "Isn't the Martial Emperor dead?"

"No!"

"......"

In an instant, everyone's gaze turned to the shadow of the Human Emperor.

The Human Emperor didn't have time to stop them and coughed lightly, "Xingyue, you just resurrected and came here. Do you know something?"

Xingyue replied curiously, "Of course I know! Before I came, the Martial Emperor was alive and well. I didn't take long to get here! When I left, he was still alive. Since he wasn't dead, he certainly won't die in the short term!"

Su Yu wouldn't kill the Martial Emperor, and the Martial Emperor wouldn't die so easily!

"Tsk tsk!"

"Hehe!"

"Heh heh!"

"Hee hee!"

"......"

At this moment, the crowd was just short of collectively booing!

Your Majesty, you miscalculated!

The Martial Emperor isn't dead!

The Human Emperor smiled and didn't mind, "Xingyue just resurrected, she doesn't understand. You saw the Martial Emperor before you left, which doesn't mean much. Actually, you crossed time on your way here. You felt it was quick, but in reality, a long time might have passed! The Martial Emperor died not long ago, so you don't know."

Forget it, he wouldn't argue with everyone and quickly changed the subject, "By the way..."

But Xingyue didn't give him a chance, frowning, "Has a long time really passed? It shouldn't be! I traveled against the current, so not much time should have passed!"

"......"

My sister, why are you still hung up on this issue!

"Xingyue, you just arrived. Let me tell you about the situation here. Quickly help everyone heal. We can't count on the Myriad Realms. Fortunately, Xingyue has resurrected!"

The Human Emperor forcibly interrupted the topic, secretly relieved. Anyway, the flow of time was up to him to decide.

The Martial Emperor is dead, and that's that!

I said so, and that's that!

The crowd was just short of rolling their eyes. Shameless, fine, you're the boss. If you insist, then so be it.

The Radiant King chuckled, "Anyway, we'll soon return to the Myriad Realms. We'll see if the Martial Emperor is dead or not."

Xingyue was surprised, "Is everyone very concerned about whether the Martial Emperor is dead?"

Why?

She mentioned that the descendants of the Control King were masters of the laws, and no one cared?

That's the real point!

Xingyue frowned slightly, just about to speak when the Battle King laughed, "Your Highness, His Majesty said the Martial Emperor died five times. We don't quite believe it... cough cough, we think the Martial Emperor couldn't have died that many times, so we're verifying."

"Five times?"

Xingyue looked at her brother's shadow strangely. Why would you lie like that!

How could he have died five times!

If it were me, I wouldn't believe it either.

Alright, stubborn as a mule, refusing to admit a mistake. I understand.

Xingyue reluctantly said, "Maybe he really is dead!"

She calculated, maybe by the time we return, the Martial Emperor will really be dead.

Su Yu is in the Myriad Realms. If the Martial Emperor doesn't behave, he'll be beaten to death by Su Yu sooner or later. Maybe before we return, the Martial Emperor will be killed by Su Yu!

At this, the Human Emperor breathed a sigh of relief and quickly said, "Xingyue, let's have a private chat. It's been so many years since we've seen each other. I'm so happy to see you this time. By the way, there seem to have been significant changes in the Myriad Realms recently..."

"Yes."

Xingyue nodded. With Su Yu around, there were naturally many changes.

"The one who saved you, the one who opened the heavens, what's his name? Although opening the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm seems a bit unbelievable, if he opened a simple heaven, it's not impossible. However... he's probably wasted, and you swallowed his path of life and death, right?"

The Human Emperor sighed, "Using life and death as the core to open the heavens, the potential is actually quite good. What a pity!"

"He saved you, is he still alive?"

In his view, the person who opened the heavens probably opened a heaven of the Great Dao of Life and Death. Now, having saved Xingyue, it's likely that Xingyue swallowed the path of life and death, so the person's core Great Dao is gone, and he might already be dead.

He couldn't say much about this.

Xingyue thought about it. Su Yu had told her not to reveal too much, and she was also worried that Su Yu might not have the strength later, leading to false hopes. After thinking it over, she said, "He's kind of wasted, but still alive!"

She didn't say much. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

Before Su Yu arrives, everyone should act as if Su Yu doesn't exist.

To avoid too high expectations, only to belittle Su Yu when they find out he's not even a master of the laws.

"I guessed as much, what a pity!"

The Human Emperor sighed again, "As long as he's alive, when we return, I'll make it up to him!"

What a pity!

Opening the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm, coincidentally opening the heaven of life and death, coincidentally able to save my sister, it must be said, this is the ultimate coincidence.

Opening the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm, the talent is still extremely strong.

Terrifyingly strong!

What a pity!

It seems there won't be any more disturbances in the future.

Others also felt a deep sense of regret.

This matter is indeed difficult to discuss, as the other party saved Xingyue, and Xingyue now controls the Great Dao of Life. A master of the laws who controls the Great Dao of Life might be more helpful than someone who opened the heavens at the Sunmoon Realm!

The Human Emperor asked again, "Is the situation in the Myriad Realms okay?"

"Not very good. The Control King betrayed us. His lineage has too many strong individuals, and there are many strong individuals among the myriad races. The human side has lost almost all its strong individuals. A few hundred years ago, there weren't even any Daofuse Realm experts, only some Eternals..."

Everyone was shocked!

How could this be?

The Human Emperor was also incredulous, "No matter how weak we are, we shouldn't be without a single Daofuse Realm expert!"

Xingyue sneered, "The Ninth Tide... that's one tide every ten thousand years. It's been a hundred thousand years since you disappeared. Six thousand years ago, the Ninth Human Lord hid with his people, abandoning the Human Realm, leading to the Tenth Tide having no strong individuals, even breaking the inheritance... Fortunately, there's Su Yu, the one who saved me. He rose rapidly in recent years, killing a large number of Daofuse Realm experts, protecting the Human Realm! But before I came, the Ninth Tide's Human Lord returned, drove Su Yu away, and took over the Human Realm..."

The crowd exchanged strange glances!

Someone gritted their teeth and asked, "What's the name of the Ninth Tide's Human Lord?"

"Hundred Battle!"

Xingyue replied coldly, "He's said to be a descendant of the Battle King, a descendant of the Human Ancestor, close to the Giant Race. The Ninth Tide caused the deaths of many of our allies, leading to no one daring to help the humans in this tide!"

Battle King?

Many people were moved, and the Human Emperor also frowned slightly, "The Battle King... the Battle King is indeed a descendant of the Human Ancestor, but the Battle King disappeared long ago, possibly to find the Human Ancestor."

As for the Control King's lineage, the Human Emperor wasn't too surprised and said casually, "The Control King betrayed us, and I finally struck him into the Gate of Hell. The time for the Gate of Hell to unseal should be about the same as my return, so there's no need to worry!"

The Battle King cursed, "The Battle King's lineage is so treacherous? They left the humans without a single Daofuse Realm expert. Are all the marquises from our time dead?"

"No!"

Xingyue replied coldly, "They all betrayed us! They followed Hundred Battle! But when I left, considering their past contributions, I didn't kill them. I extracted half of their life force and physical strength to settle the score for their betrayal!"

"They should all be killed!"

Someone was furious, but the Human Emperor smiled, "Forget it, they're all humans! Even if they're descendants of the Human Ancestor, they're not as bad as Xingyue says. This Hundred Battle must have been trying to protect the humans, otherwise, Xingyue would have killed them!"

He continued, smiling, "Xingyue, did you bring the extracted physical strength and life force to heal us? My sister, you are indeed thoughtful!"

"......"

Xingyue was silent for a moment before saying, "No, on the way, I traveled against the current, consuming too much, so I used those things as energy for traveling against the current!"

"......"

Alright!

The Human Emperor, though a bit disappointed, didn't mind too much and smiled, "Forget it, it's enough that you're here. The River of Time here is solidified, and there won't be any more reverse currents!"

Xingyue's presence was enough!

He was in a very good mood!

She was resurrected and came here, and she controls the Great Dao of Life. At this moment, the Human Emperor was in an excellent mood!

As for the Martial Emperor, forget it, who cares about the Martial Emperor!

And that Su Yu... when we return, we should thank him.

As for Hundred Battle and the descendants of the Control King, he didn't care. They were all minor issues.

Everyone was in a good mood. With Xingyue's arrival, they had gained another master of the laws, and a healer at that. Plus, they heard some gossip, so everyone was quite pleased.

The matters of the Myriad Realms can be dealt with when we return!

No matter how annoying it is now, there's nothing we can do.

They can't retreat, can't return. If they go with the flow, and the myriad races attack, losing a master of the laws would be a big problem!

In this battle, they can only face it head-on, not retreat.

Dragging it out for as long as possible! When the time comes that I must return, I'll deal with it then!

At this moment, Xingyue followed the shadow of the Human Emperor, overhearing someone lamenting the unfortunate fate of that Sunmoon Realm kid. Xingyue wanted to retort but decided against it. Even her brother was sighing, saying how rare it was to see the path of life and death, truly a pity!

"Is the path of life and death... really that rare?" Xingyue wanted to argue but held her tongue, feeling a bit stifled.

Su Yu's core wasn't even the path of life and death! If Xingyue remembered correctly, after her revival, Su Yu's world was incredibly stable, not affected at all. Why did it seem to her brother that Su Yu's world had collapsed?

Strange!

Xingyue didn't want to say anything more. Fine, let them think what they want!

At this moment, she remembered Su Yu's words, planning to surprise the Human Emperor when they met!

Yes, a big surprise!

Thinking of this, Xingyue hesitated for a moment and said, "Brother, I have a very powerful subordinate in the Myriad Realms. He said he would come to rescue you!"

"Oh, haha!" The Human Emperor nodded, smiling. He appreciated his sister's intentions.

The Myriad Realms? There are no rulers of laws there!

Ah, the younger generation, indeed. They've never seen true power and have become conceited. Do they even know what a ruler of laws is?

Probably not!

Well, his sister had been dead for many years and was only at the Eternal level. The subordinate she mentioned, could it be someone from the Sunmoon Realm?

The Human Emperor chuckled inwardly, deciding not to say more, sparing his sister's dignity.

She probably just revived and wasn't thinking clearly.

Was it necessary to tell me this specifically?

And a very powerful subordinate, just how powerful?

The Human Emperor sighed once more.

P.S.: I still need to visit the hospital. The next update will be before 11 o'clock!
