Chapter 688: I Am Supreme in the Myriad Realms (Ten Thousand Words, Seeking Subscriptions)

Easily tricking someone out of a war weapon and six councilor tokens, Su Yu grew a little more interested in Immortal War Marquis. He chuckled, “Does this person possess Heavenly King combat power?”

He was stronger than Meteor Marquis!

And Su Yu had rated Meteor Marquis as top-tier third-class.

“Heavenly King combat power?”

Life Emperor generally understood his meaning and nodded. “Roughly so! The Immortal Race’s Immortal War Marquis and Primal Sage Marquis, the Devil Race’s Blood Severing Marquis, the human race’s Minshan Marquis… these Marquises all possess top-tier Daofuse combat power! Among the 1080 Marquises of ancient times, there were actually varying ranks in private! The most elite among them could be considered Heavenly Kings, as Emperor Yu put it.”

Su Yu nodded slightly, saying little. He glanced at the sky above and then asked, “What about your race’s Heavenly Fate Marquis?”

“This…”

After a moment of hesitation, Life Emperor still replied, “Heavenly Fate Marquis is very strong. Among the 1080 Marquises, he ranks in the top ten, already close to the realm of some Masters of Laws, only slightly weaker than Hundred Battle King, with not too large a gap.”

“Such an existence could perhaps be described as a Half-King!”

Life Emperor said softly, “My race’s ability to stand firm until today is largely due to Heavenly Fate Marquis! Hundred Battle King, strictly speaking, is also only at the Half-King realm, but his strength is slightly superior to Heavenly Fate Marquis.”

“How many such existences are there in the Upper Realm?”

“Not many.”

Life Emperor quickly said, “Even if various races have them, they are their foundational powerhouses!”

Su Yu frowned slightly. “Then, is Hundred Battle King considered among the most top-tier?”

“Of course!”

Life Emperor nodded. “If he wasn’t among the most top-tier, he wouldn’t have fought so miserably. It’s precisely because he was too strong that he suffered such a fate.”

Su Yu wanted to laugh.

Alright then.

“It seems the Upper Realm is quite deep!”

Su Yu chuckled, “I originally thought that a few Heavenly King-level experts in the Death Realm would be extraordinary, but I didn’t expect there to be quite a few Heavenly Kings in the Upper Realm too.”

“Not many.”

Life Emperor still quickly said, “After all, countless years have accumulated. Some ancient Marquises were also exceptionally talented individuals. After more than a hundred thousand years of gradual cultivation, some have indeed reached this level!”

Su Yu nodded again and asked, “How much longer do you think it will take for this Upper Realm Gate to open?”

“Around five years!”

Life Emperor said gravely, “The consumption of the power of laws has been quite large recently. If this continues, the Gate of Heavenly Fate will definitely open in five years!”

“Still five years?”

Su Yu smiled. “That’s fine, quite a long time!”

Life Emperor was speechless.

Long?

It was very short, actually.

For powerhouses, it was merely the blink of an eye during a closed-door cultivation session.

Only Su Yu would think it was fine!

In reality, before, when it was roughly ten years, everyone felt that ten years would pass in a flash. The myriad races weren’t anxious before because the Upper Realm was truly about to open, very soon.

The Allheaven Battlefield had been sealed for five thousand years, and it had been open for roughly nine hundred and ninety years since then.

Six thousand years, and the Upper Realm was about to open, just a quick twitch away!

However, something went wrong during this final twitch!

No one could have anticipated such a major change!

Su Yu looked at Life Emperor, silent for a moment, then spoke, “I want to station powerhouses in the Life Realm.”

Life Emperor was silent for a moment, not speaking.

Su Yu continued, “Also, I want to pinpoint where the Death Realm corresponds to this place, and build a City of Death beneath it! I will dispatch Heavenly Kings and a large number of Death Marquises to be stationed here. What does Life Emperor think?”

Heavenly Kings!

Death Marquises!

A large number… how many is a large number?

Had Su Yu truly unified the Death Realm?

Life Emperor felt bitter.

After a long while, he nodded. “Good! The Life Race… has already made its decision, so naturally, we hope the human race can win! However, this place is becoming increasingly unstable. People from the Upper Realm might descend at any time, or even directly spy on the Life Realm. If human powerhouses are gathered here… there might be issues! Dispatching powerhouses from other races would lead to suppression.”

Su Yu thought about it and nodded. That was true.

“Then I’ll think about it again!”

Su Yu chuckled, “Thank you, Life Emperor, for providing intelligence, helping me kill these six Daofuse experts, and tricking Immortal War Marquis out of his weapon and six councilor tokens. In this battle, Life Emperor’s contributions are immense!”

“It’s my duty!”

Life Emperor looked at Su Yu with a bitter expression.

Su Yu smiled. “Life Emperor isn’t happy?”

“I’m fine, it’s just… could Emperor Yu please remove this recording talisman?”

“No!”

Su Yu chuckled, “Because I want to compile biographies for the human race’s allies, the Emperors of various races! To serve as images passed down to future generations! As a meritorious minister of the human race, of course I must record your achievements!”

He felt exhausted.

No one did things like this.

Indeed, Su Yu had many methods to subdue the various races.

Life Emperor thought for a moment and said, “Emperor Yu, subduing the various races still depends on where people’s hearts lie, not on petty tricks…”

Su Yu nodded. “First, beat them with a big stick until they cry, then offer a sweet date! It has always been this way since ancient times! If they aren’t hurt, constantly giving benefits is not the right path!”

Su Yu chuckled, “So-called cooperation and alliances are all built on certain foundations: interests, emotions, future… and deterrence!”

Su Yu lightly laughed, “Right now, our emotions aren’t deep enough, our interests aren’t quite sufficient, and the future is uncertain, so let’s start with deterrence!”

“…”

Life Emperor was speechless.

He nodded, saying nothing more.

However, seeing Su Yu about to leave, he still followed and quickly said, “Emperor Yu, can Tiangu and the others be defeated?”

“No rush.”

Su Yu chuckled, “What’s the rush? There’s no need to force them into a fight to the death! Why bother? Give them a little hope. If they’re all driven to a dead end, they might as well fight. You always have to give people hope. I don’t want to see them fight with their backs against the wall, burning their bridges!”

“Cutting meat with a dull knife is better. Look, I’ve cut them down again and again, taking out eleven Daofuse experts, without any losses to myself. After cutting them, they still can’t bear to die right now. Everyone fears death! The more powerful they are, the more they fear it!”

Life Emperor nodded. “They know that too, but they also hold some hope that Emperor Yu won’t forcefully attack the various realms before the Upper Realm opens. So I think, if Emperor Yu wants to drag it out until it opens naturally, it’s best not to forcefully attack the various realms in these next few years!”

These were the words of an experienced elder.

Forcefully attacking the various realms now would easily drive people to despair, and in despair, they would fight to the death!

“I have my limits!”

“I spoke out of turn.”

Life Emperor knew Su Yu’s domineering personality. If he weren’t domineering, he wouldn’t have come to the Life Realm alone. This one was even more domineering than Culture King of old, more direct, and more unsettling.

Culture King, in fact, was considered quite easy to talk to.

Soon, Su Yu walked out of the Life Realm. Outside the Life Realm, everyone turned back. Su Yu said nothing, and Life Emperor, following behind, also said nothing.

Su Yu looked around, surveying the heavens. After a long while, he spoke, “What’s the situation with the Primordial Giant Race?”

Great Zhou King saw everyone looking at him. After a moment, he said gravely, “Reporting to Emperor Yu, the Primordial Giant Race… has… has some connection with Hundred Battle King.”

Su Yu had guessed as much.

He nodded. “You used that connection to contact them before?”

“Yes.”

“And now?”

“Before… I used Hundred Battle King’s favor. Now… I don’t know their intentions.”

Su Yu nodded. “Go and visit the Primordial Giant Race, and state our position! Three choices: First, an ally of the Immortal, Devil, and God races! Second, my ally! Third, Hundred Battle King’s ally! The first choice means certain death! The second choice means the Primordial Giant King comes to the Human Realm to pay homage! The third choice… seal the realm! Let him wait for Hundred Battle King!”

Great Zhou King said gravely, “Understood!”

“Go now!”

Great Zhou King hesitated for a moment, then quickly departed.

Su Yu wanted to categorize all powerhouses as either friend or foe.

If not with me, then against me!

Fortunately, he still gave a third option: seal their own realm, not allowing them to come out casually. If they did come out, they would need to cause some commotion, so as not to disrupt his plans.

Great Zhou King dared not delay and quickly left to visit the Primordial Giant Race.

And Su Yu, at this moment, looked down upon the Myriad Heavens, his voice shaking them all: “Tiangu, Ji Wu, Demon Halberd, seal your realms! I need time to wait for the Upper Realm to open, and you also need time to wait for the Upper Realm to open!”

“If I forcefully attack the various realms, you will fight to the death. You probably don’t want to be killed by me, and both you and I need time! You don’t want to die, and I don’t want to face the powerhouses of the Upper Realm too soon!”

“Sealing your realms gives both sides a way out. Don’t force me to forcefully attack the various realms and fight to the death!”

Su Yu’s voice was icy cold. “The choice is yours! Whichever realm is unwilling to seal itself, then today, I will annihilate you! I want to see who is willing to be buried with those who refuse to seal their realms? When the Upper Realm opens, you will still have a chance. Now… do you have a chance?”

His voice reverberated through the Myriad Heavens!

Waves of incredibly powerful aura erupted from Su Yu’s side.

“I still have forces I haven’t deployed: Culture King’s White Dog, with Heavenly King combat power! The Thirty-Six Guardians are all top-tier Eternal experts! If any of you think you can contend, feel free to try!”

Su Yu coldly shouted, “Seal your realms within one day, otherwise… I will break through your realms and fight! Before I die, I will exterminate the Myriad Heavens!”

The Myriad Realms fell silent.

Su Yu didn’t play games with them, nor was he ambiguous. Either you seal your realm and wait, or… today, you fight to the death.

One path to life, one path to death, how would you choose?

Even if he broke through the realms, Su Yu wouldn’t have an easy time, and it might cause the Upper Realm to open prematurely. The key was that he had enough strength to kill them all.

Above the Immortal Realm, Tiangu’s phantom floated, looking at Su Yu in the sky, who was radiating boundless light!

In the past, he, Tiangu, was the ruler of these Myriad Heavens.

Today, it was Su Yu.

Only three years had passed.

Tiangu sighed inwardly, his voice calm. “Su Yu, if you want us to seal our realms, that’s fine! However, if you forcefully attack any realm, then we will fight to the death…”

Su Yu scoffed, mocking, “Do you dare? Tiangu, if the Devil Realm says they dare, I believe it! If the Divine Realm says they dare, I also believe it! You, Tiangu, are the most afraid of death, you don’t even dare to fight outside your realm, so stop talking nonsense with me! I bet others dare to fight me to the death, but I bet you don’t! If you don’t believe me, try not sealing your Immortal Race realm!”

Tiangu’s face turned ugly.

A slap in the face!

Su Yu was relentlessly humiliating him.

And Su Yu said faintly, “Stop pretending. If you’re afraid of death, just admit it, and stop harming your teammates! Tiangu, do you think I can’t see through you? Perhaps… you also have Heavenly King combat power, but you’re acting like a subservient grandson, perhaps even wishing I’d kill more Immortal Race powerhouses! Don’t think I don’t know that most of the Daofuse experts who cultivated the Immortal Emperor’s Dao are probably dead. In fact, for those who have lived long in various races, if you trace back, you’ll know how many powerhouses who cultivated the Immortal Emperor’s Dao died in the previous nine tides, it’s a clear number!”

Su Yu sneered, “You can hide it from others, but can you hide it from me? Some in the Immortal Race probably know too. I think people like Han Xiang might not be unable to advance to Daofuse, but they dare not because they cultivate the Dao of Life! Jade King, Han Xiang, and others have been stuck at Eternal for countless years. Is it truly impossible for them to advance? I see incompetent and untalented people like Weapon King and Talisman King can advance, yet Han Xiang and others, who have dominated a tide, cannot advance… ridiculous!”

“They all know it in their hearts, but they just don’t dare!”

“They’d rather die of old age than Daofuse. Pitiful, lamentable!”

The Myriad Realms were silent.

Was this a secret?

Not really!

But it was the first time someone had exposed it in front of the Myriad Realms.

Just before this, Tiangu had actually directly stated that Primal Sage Marquis walked the Immortal Emperor’s Grand Dao, and Tiangu, being extremely domineering, told him to change his Dao. When the other refused, he even explicitly told him to learn from the human race’s Daofuse experts of the previous tide, to be a vanguard, to die!

This matter, among the Immortal Race’s high-ranking members, was truly no secret.

Everyone knew about it!

Therefore, walking the Immortal Emperor’s Dao of Life was going against Tiangu, and everyone understood this.

Before, no one had said anything.

Now, Su Yu had exposed Tiangu in front of the Myriad Realms. Above the Immortal Realm, Tiangu’s face darkened slightly. He said gravely, “Su Yu, all races are like this, why bother! Not to mention my race, your human race…”

Su Yu directly interrupted, “Shut up! Don’t mention Hundred Battle King, it has nothing to do with me! I, Su Yu, don’t need to be like that!”

Tiangu scoffed, “Culture King’s pen dao…”

Wasn’t that also monopolized by you!

How dare you talk about me?

Su Yu smiled faintly, “In the Human Realm, whoever can step into the pen dao, I will voluntarily yield the path. These are Su Yu’s words, witnessed by the Myriad Heavens! Ridiculous fellow, how can you compare to me? Why don’t you say that whoever steps onto the Immortal Emperor’s Dao, you will also yield the path? Then I would respect you three points!”

Tiangu looked at Su Yu. After a long while, he let out a light chuckle and said no more.

A moment later, the Immortal Realm vibrated, and a monstrous aura surged.

Sealing the realm!

He didn’t want to argue with Su Yu anymore.

In a war of words, even though Su Yu was young, he was not weak in debate, and he had seen and known many things. Su Yu himself also possessed ample courage. His single statement, "I will yield the pen dao," instantly made Tiangu lose the desire to argue with him.

Did he dare to say that?

No!

He could only admit defeat and swallow this silent loss.

The Immortal Realm was sealed!

At this moment, the Myriad Heavens fell silent.

Even the strongest Immortal Race chose to temporarily avoid the sharp edge, retreating three paces. How could other races contend?

Soon, the Devil Realm was sealed.

After a while, a coughing sound came from the Divine Realm, and Ji Wu’s voice rang out: “Su Yu, the former Empress Consort wants to say a few words to you…”

Su Yu smiled, looking towards the Divine Realm from afar.

“Say what?”

“You should have opened the Heaven Gate. The former Empress Consort wants to ask, is the former Emperor… dead or alive?”

Interesting!

Su Yu chuckled, “Perhaps alive! Who knows, I can’t see the Dao of those top-tier powerhouses! Since your former Empress Consort asked, I’ve answered truthfully. I heard that a few Sunmoon experts from my human race once defected to the Divine Race and changed their bloodlines. If you kill them now, it will repay my favor for answering you!”

The Divine Emperor was speechless.

Su Yu chuckled, “Unwilling? Then so be it!”

And at this moment, an aged voice rang out: “Kill them, as repayment for this generation’s Human Lord’s reply. This old woman… merely misses my Emperor. Though there is no answer, there is a little more hope, hope… that I can await the day my Emperor returns.”

Su Yu said indifferently, “I hope so! At the very last moment before the Upper Realm opens, all of you be careful. If I cannot live… whether you can live depends on luck! At the last moment of opening, five years from now, roughly around that time, I will definitely attack the myriad races!”

As soon as these words were spoken, some powerhouses felt a chill.

At the last moment before the Upper Realm opened, Su Yu would definitely attack the myriad races… Since he said so, he would certainly do it!

That would also be the most dangerous time.

Five years at most!

Silence reigned in all directions. A moment later, outside the Divine Realm, several corpses appeared, and the Divine Realm, with a rumble, also sealed itself!

All powerhouses sealed their realms!

This was unprecedented throughout history, and it had been achieved in this tide.

Su Yu led the powerhouses from all directions, suppressing the Myriad Realms!

And at this moment, Su Yu was twenty-one years old.

At this moment, countless humans cheered with joy.

“Emperor Yu is sagacious!”

Overwhelming shouts reverberated through heaven and earth. At this moment, the Iron Devourer Realm, the Hou Realm, the Ancient Spatial Beast Realm… some subjugated minor realms, all sent forth cheers. The myriad races paid homage!

The human race’s destiny surged!

On Su Yu’s body, the Human Lord Seal instantly appeared. The next moment, maps of various realms, no longer just the Human Realm, emerged on the Human Lord Seal.

Su Yu’s aura was ethereal, golden light covering heaven and earth.

At this moment,
