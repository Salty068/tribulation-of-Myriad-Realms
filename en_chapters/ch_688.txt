Chapter 688: Supreme Among the Myriad Realms

Su Yu effortlessly swindled a battle weapon and six councilor tokens. He found himself increasingly intrigued by the Immortal Battle Marquis and asked with a smile, "Does this person possess the combat strength of a Heavenly King?"

Stronger than the Falling Star Marquis!

And the Falling Star Marquis, in Su Yu's estimation, was a top-tier third-class.

"Heavenly King combat strength?"

The Fate Emperor understood his implication and nodded, "More or less! The Immortal Battle Marquis of the Immortal Race, the Origin Saint Marquis, the Blood Severing Marquis of the Demon Race, and the Minshan Marquis of the Human Race... these marquises all possess top-tier Daofuse combat strength! Among the ancient 1080 marquises, there are indeed varying levels of strength! The most elite among them can be considered as Heavenly Kings, as Emperor Yu once described."

Su Yu nodded slightly, not saying much. He glanced at the sky and asked, "What about your clan's Destiny Marquis?"

"This..."

After a moment of hesitation, the Fate Emperor replied, "The Destiny Marquis is very strong, ranking in the top ten among the 1080 marquises, already nearing the realm of some rulers of laws, slightly weaker than the Hundred Battle King, but the gap isn't too large."

"Such an existence might be described as a half-king!"

The Fate Emperor spoke softly, "Our clan's continued existence is largely due to the Destiny Marquis! Strictly speaking, the Hundred Battle King is also only at the half-king realm, but his strength is slightly superior to the Destiny Marquis."

"How many such existences are there in the Upper Realm?"

"Not many."

The Fate Emperor quickly replied, "Even if some races have them, they are the strongest of their kind!"

Su Yu frowned slightly, "Is the Hundred Battle King considered the top among them?"

"Of course!"

The Fate Emperor nodded, "If he weren't among the top, he wouldn't have fought so miserably. It's precisely because he's too strong that he suffered."

Su Yu wanted to laugh.

Alright.

"It seems the waters of the Upper Realm run deep!"

Su Yu chuckled, "I initially thought that having a few Heavenly King-level figures in the Death Realm was impressive, but it turns out there are quite a few Heavenly Kings in the Upper Realm."

"Not that many."

The Fate Emperor quickly added, "After all, countless years have passed, and some ancient marquises were exceptionally talented. Over tens of thousands of years, some have slowly reached this level!"

Su Yu nodded again and asked, "How long do you think it will take for the Upper Realm Gate to open?"

"Around five years!"

The Fate Emperor said solemnly, "Recently, the power of laws has been greatly consumed. If this continues, the Gate of Destiny will inevitably open in five years!"

"Five more years?"

Su Yu laughed, "That's quite a while!"

The Fate Emperor was speechless.

Is it long?

It's very short, really.

For the strong, it's just the time it takes to close their eyes in meditation.

Only Su Yu would think it's long!

In fact, it was about ten years before, and everyone thought that ten years would pass in the blink of an eye. The myriad races weren't in a hurry because the Upper Realm was truly about to open, and it was happening too quickly.

The Allheaven Battlefield had been closed for 5000 years, and it had been open for about 990 years now.

6000 years in total, and the opening of the Upper Realm was just around the corner!

But then, this last moment, something happened!

No one expected such a major upheaval!

Su Yu looked at the Fate Emperor, remained silent for a while, and then said, "I want to station strong individuals in the Fate Realm."

The Fate Emperor was silent for a moment, not speaking.

Su Yu continued, "Also, I want to locate where the Death Realm corresponds to and build a City of the Dead beneath it! I will deploy Heavenly Kings and a large number of Death Marquises to garrison there. What does the Fate Emperor think?"

Heavenly Kings!

Death Marquises!

A large number... how many is a large number?

Has Su Yu truly unified the Death Realm?

The Fate Emperor felt bitter.

After a long time, he nodded, "Alright! The Fate Race... has already made a decision, naturally hoping the Human Race can win! However, this place is becoming increasingly unstable, and someone from the Upper Realm might descend at any time, or simply spy on the Fate Realm. If human strong individuals are deployed here... it might be inappropriate! Deploying strong individuals from other races will be suppressed."

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "I'll think about it!"

Su Yu smiled, "Thank you, Fate Emperor, for providing information and helping me kill six Daofuse experts this time, swindling the Immortal Battle Marquis's weapon and six councilor tokens. In this battle, the Fate Emperor has rendered great service!"

"It was my duty!"

The Fate Emperor wore a bitter expression as he looked at Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled, "Is the Fate Emperor unhappy?"

"Not really, it's just... could Emperor Yu remove this recording talisman?"

"No."

Su Yu smiled, "Because I want to create chronicles for the Human Race's allies, for the emperors of various races, to serve as historical records for future generations! As a meritorious figure for the Human Race, I naturally have to document the Fate Emperor's contributions!"

Exhausted.

No one does it this way.

Indeed, Su Yu has many means to subdue the various races.

The Fate Emperor thought for a moment and said, "Emperor Yu, to subdue the various races, it's still about winning people's hearts, not relying on small tricks..."

Su Yu nodded, "First, wield the big stick, make them cry, then give them the sweet date! It's always been this way! If you don't make them hurt, just giving benefits isn't the right path!"

Su Yu laughed, "So-called cooperation and alliances are built on certain foundations: interests, emotions, future... and deterrence!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Right now, our emotions aren't deep enough, the interests aren't sufficient, the future is uncertain, so let's start with deterrence!"

"......"

Speechless.

The Fate Emperor nodded and said no more.

However, seeing Su Yu about to leave, he still followed and quickly said, "Emperor Yu, can Tiangu and the others be defeated?"

"No rush."

Su Yu smiled, "Why rush? There's no need to push them to the brink! Why do that? Give them a glimmer of hope. If they're all driven to desperation, they'll fight to the death. It's better to give them hope. I don't want to see them fight with their backs against the wall, burning their boats!"

"Cutting flesh with a dull knife is better. Look, I cut again and again, cut 11 Daofuse experts, and didn't suffer any losses myself. After cutting, they still can't bear to die now. Everyone fears death! The stronger they are, the more they fear!"

The Fate Emperor nodded, "They know this too, but they still hold some hope, hoping that before the Upper Realm opens, Emperor Yu won't attack the various realms again. So I think, if Emperor Yu wants to delay until it opens naturally, it's best not to attack the various realms in these years!"

This was an old and wise suggestion.

Attacking the various realms now could easily lead to despair, and in despair, they might as well fight!

"I have my own considerations!"

"I spoke out of turn."

The Fate Emperor knew Su Yu's domineering nature. Without being domineering, he wouldn't have come alone to the Fate Realm. This person was even more domineering than the Culture King of old, more direct, and made people more uneasy.

The Culture King was actually quite easy to talk to.

Soon, Su Yu walked out of the Fate Realm. Outside the Fate Realm, everyone turned to look. Su Yu said nothing, and the Fate Emperor, following behind, also said nothing.

Su Yu looked around, overlooking the heavens, and after a long time, he spoke, "What's the situation with the Ancient Giant Race?"

The Great Zhou King saw everyone looking at him, and after a moment, he said in a deep voice, "Reporting to Emperor Yu, the Ancient Giant Race... has some ties with the Hundred Battle King."

Su Yu had guessed as much.

He nodded, "Previously, you used this connection to contact the other party?"

"Yes."

"And now?"

"Previously... it was a favor from the Hundred Battle King. Now... I don't know their intentions."

Su Yu nodded, "You go to the Ancient Giant Race, make your stance clear! Three choices: first, ally with the Immortal, Demon, and God alliance! Second, ally with me! Third, ally with the Hundred Battle King! The first choice, they will be killed! The second choice, the Ancient Giant King comes to the Human Realm to pay homage! The third choice... seal the realm! Let them wait for the Hundred Battle King!"

The Great Zhou King said in a deep voice, "Understood!"

"Go now!"

The Great Zhou King hesitated for a moment but quickly left.

Su Yu wanted to delineate all enemies and allies.

If you're not with me, you're against me!

Fortunately, he still gave a third choice: seal the realm, not allowing them to come out casually. If they do come out, they need to make some noise to avoid disrupting his plans.

The Great Zhou King dared not delay and quickly left to visit the Ancient Giant Race.

Meanwhile, Su Yu, overlooking the myriad realms, his voice resounded through the heavens, "Tiangu, Jiwu, Demon Halberd, seal your realms! I need time to wait for the Upper Realm to open, and you need time to wait for the Upper Realm to open!"

"If I attack the various realms, you will fight to the death. You probably don't want me to kill you, and I, like you, need time! You don't want to die, and I don't want to face the strong of the Upper Realm too soon!"

"Seal your realms, and we both have a way out. Don't force me to attack the various realms and fight to the death!"

Su Yu's voice was icy, "The choice is yours! If any realm refuses to seal, then today, I will annihilate you! I want to see who is willing to die for those who refuse to seal their realms? When the Upper Realm opens, you still have a chance. Now... do you have a chance?"

His voice echoed through the myriad realms!

One after another, powerful auras erupted from Su Yu's side.

"I still have forces unused, the Culture King's dog, with Heavenly King combat strength! Thirty-six guardians, all top-tier Eternals! If you think you can resist, feel free to try!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, "Within a day, seal your realms, or... break the realms and fight. Before I die, I will annihilate the myriad realms!"

The myriad realms fell silent.

Su Yu wasn't playing games with them, not being vague. Either seal your realms and wait, or... break the realms and fight today.

One path to life, one path to death, how will you choose?

Even if the realms are broken, Su Yu won't have it easy. It might lead to the Upper Realm opening prematurely. The key is, killing them is enough; he has the strength to do so.

Above the Immortal Realm, Tiangu's phantom floated, looking at Su Yu in the sky, radiating brilliance!

In the past, Tiangu was the ruler of these heavens.

Today, it was Su Yu.

In just three years.

Tiangu sighed inwardly, his voice calm, "Su Yu, if you want us to seal our realms, that's possible! However, if you attack any realm, then we'll fight to the death..."

Su Yu sneered, mocking, "Do you dare? Tiangu, if the Demon Realm says they dare, I believe it! If the God Realm says they dare, I believe it too! But you, Tiangu, are the most afraid of death. You don't even dare to leave the realm to fight, so spare me the nonsense! I bet others dare to fight to the death with me, but you don't! If you don't believe me, try not sealing the Immortal Realm!"

Tiangu's face turned ugly.

A slap in the face!

Su Yu was relentlessly slapping his face.

Su Yu spoke calmly, "Stop pretending, Tiangu. If you're afraid of death, just admit it. But don't drag your allies down with you! Do you think I can't see through you? Maybe... you also possess the power of a Heavenly King, yet you act so subservient, perhaps hoping I'll kill more of the Immortal Race's experts for you! Don't think I don't know. The path of the Immortal Emperor's Daofuse has seen countless deaths over the past nine tides. It's clear how many have perished."

With a sneer, Su Yu continued, "You might fool others, but not me. The Immortal Race probably knows too. I doubt that people like Han Xiang can't advance to Daofuse. It's just that they cultivate the Path of Life and dare not advance! Jade King, Han Xiang, they've been stuck at the Eternal stage for countless years. Is it truly impossible for them to advance? I see people like the Weapon King and the Symbol King, who lack virtue and talent, advancing. Yet, Han Xiang and the others, who dominated an entire tide, can't advance... laughable!"

"They know it in their hearts but dare not act!"

"They'd rather die of old age than advance to Daofuse. It's pitiful and lamentable!"

The Myriad Realms fell silent.

Was this a secret?

Not really!

But it was the first time someone had openly exposed it before the Myriad Realms.

In fact, Tiangu had already mentioned that Marquis Yuan Sheng followed the Immortal Emperor's path and had been domineering enough to demand that he change paths. When he refused, Tiangu bluntly suggested he follow the Human Race's previous tide's Daofuse and become a vanguard to die!

This wasn't really a secret among the upper echelons of the Immortal Race.

Everyone knew this!

So, following the Immortal Emperor's Path of Life was essentially opposing Tiangu, and everyone was aware of this.

Previously, no one spoke of it.

Now, Su Yu had exposed Tiangu before the Myriad Realms. Above the Immortal Realm, Tiangu's expression turned slightly grim as he said in a deep voice, "Su Yu, all races are like this. Why bother? Not to mention my race, your Human Race..."

Su Yu interrupted, "Shut up! Don't bring up the Hundred Battle King; it has nothing to do with me! I, Su Yu, don't need to do such things!"

Tiangu mocked, "The Culture King's pen dao..."

Didn't you monopolize it too?

And you have the audacity to criticize me?

Su Yu smiled lightly, "In the Human Realm, anyone who can step into the pen dao, I will willingly make way for them. This is my promise as Su Yu! The Myriad Realms are witnesses! Laughable fool, do you even deserve to compare yourself to me? Why don't you declare that anyone who steps onto the Immortal Emperor's path, you'll make way for them? Then I'd respect you a bit more!"

Tiangu looked at Su Yu for a long time, then chuckled softly and said no more.

Moments later, the Immortal Realm trembled, and a surge of overwhelming energy rose.

Sealing the realm!

He didn't want to argue with Su Yu any longer.

In a verbal spar, despite Su Yu's youth, he was no slouch. He saw and knew much, and Su Yu himself was full of spirit. His declaration of making way for the pen dao instantly made Tiangu lose the will to argue.

Could he say the same?

He couldn't!

So he could only accept the loss and swallow this bitter pill.

The Immortal Realm sealed itself!

In that instant, the Myriad Realms fell silent.

The strongest of the Immortal Race chose to temporarily avoid the sharp edge and retreat. How could the other races continue to fight?

Soon, the Devil Realm sealed itself.

After a while, a cough echoed from the Divine Realm, and Jiwu's voice rang out, "Su Yu, the former consort wishes to speak with you..."

Su Yu laughed, looking towards the Divine Realm.

"What does she want to say?"

"You've likely opened the Heaven Gate. The former consort wants to ask if the former emperor... is alive or dead?"

Interesting!

Su Yu chuckled, "Perhaps alive! Who knows? I can't see the paths of those top experts! Since your former consort asked, I'll answer truthfully. I've heard that a few Sunmoon of my Human Race defected to the Divine Race and changed their bloodlines. Kill them now, and consider it a favor returned to me!"

The God Emperor remained silent.

Su Yu laughed, "Unwilling? Then forget it!"

At that moment, an elderly voice spoke, "Kill them, to repay this generation's Human Lord for his response. I... just miss my emperor. Though I have no answer, I have a bit more hope, hoping... to see the day my emperor returns."

Su Yu said indifferently, "I hope so! Be careful at the last moment when the Upper Realm opens. If I can't survive... whether you can survive depends on luck! At the last moment of opening, in about five years, I will attack the Myriad Races!"

These words made some experts' hearts tremble.

At the last moment of the Upper Realm's opening, Su Yu would attack the Myriad Races... since he said it, he would certainly do it!

That would be the most dangerous time.

At most, five years!

The surroundings fell silent, and moments later, outside the Divine Realm, several corpses appeared, and with a rumble, the Divine Realm sealed itself!

The powerful sealed their realms!

This was unprecedented, achieved in this tide.

Su Yu led the strong from all directions, suppressing the Myriad Realms!

At this moment, Su Yu was 21 years old.

At this moment, countless humans cheered.

"Emperor Yu is wise!"

The overwhelming voices shook the heavens and earth. At this moment, in the Iron Devourer Race, Hou Race, Space Ancient Beast Race... some of the small realms that had surrendered, cheers erupted, and the Myriad Races worshipped!

The Human Race's fortune surged!

On Su Yu's body, the Human Lord Seal appeared instantly, and the next moment, maps of various realms appeared on the Human Lord Seal, no longer just the Human Realm.

Su Yu's aura was ethereal, golden light covering the heavens and earth.

At this moment, he had achieved the glory that the previous nine tides had not!

Zero Daofuse deaths, killing 11 Daofuse!

The Myriad Races sealed their realms!

Above the Human Realm, Su Yu's shadow covered the heavens and earth, visible to all in the Myriad Realms, sitting in the Human Realm, the Lord of the Human Realm, Su Yu, winning the people's hearts.

Even if such glory might only last five years.

It was enough!

Five years was unparalleled glory. Even if Su Yu died in battle five years later, he would leave an indelible mark in these hundred thousand years!

And at this moment, in the distance, the Ancient Giant Realm rumbled with a loud noise and sealed itself.

Su Yu squinted his eyes and smiled.

Interesting!

They actually chose the third option. The Hundred Battle King is known for betraying allies, and at this time, the Ancient Giant Race chose to support the Hundred Battle King. This... is somewhat incomprehensible.

Su Yu thought they would choose the second option!

Moments later, the Great Zhou King returned, looking somewhat embarrassed, and looked at Su Yu, "Reporting to Emperor Yu..."

"Speak directly, why? Is there a reason?"

The Great Zhou King awkwardly replied, "Yes, the Ancient Giant King said... his... his daughter, and the Hundred Battle King... that... that... had an offspring, who is now the crown prince of the Ancient Giant Race! I..."

Everyone was stunned. Was there such a thing?

Even the Hou Pseudo Emperor couldn't help but ask, "Is this true? How come we didn't know?"

"I... I didn't know before either."

The Great Zhou King was extremely embarrassed, "I really didn't know before. I only knew that the Hundred Battle King had some private dealings with the Ancient Giant Race."

Su Yu laughed, "Interesting! A descendant of the Hundred Battle King? Fascinating! Forget it, I understand! Let it be! Since they've sealed their realm, it's their choice. If they dare to open it rashly, we'll cut them down!"

With that, Su Yu looked towards the Human Realm and shouted, "Human Realm armies, four generals heed my command! Conquer the Myriad Races! Conquer realms without Daofuse! Those who do not comply, exterminate their race, destroy their realm! Surrender, hand over thirty percent of your realm's resources! A single percent less, and your realm and race will be destroyed!"

"Yes!"

A thunderous response echoed through the Myriad Realms!

Excitement, exhilaration, beyond words.

Conquer the heavens!

Su Yu shouted again, "Reward the Tianma Race of the Myriad Races with 10 pieces of carrying objects, a thousand drops of Sunmoon Profound Yellow Liquid! Reward the Mountain Antelope Race of the Myriad Races with 8 pieces of carrying objects, a thousand drops of Sunmoon Profound Yellow Liquid! Exterminate the Xuan Armor Race of the Myriad Races, annihilate them, leave none alive!"

"Exterminate the Cloud Tiger, Barbaric Bull, and Flying Tiger races of the Myriad Races, annihilate them!"

"Yes!"

The earth-shattering response rose again!

Beside Su Yu, among the strong of various races, some were surprised, some puzzled, some fearful.

What was going on?

And the Great Xia King and others, their mouths twitched slightly. This... this is holding grudges.

Of course, he also remembered favors.

This matter traced back to when Su Yu fled the Great Xia Prefecture. He still remembered!

Convinced!

The Cloud Tiger and these races had been targeted by the Great Xia Prefecture before, but because the Flying Tiger Race sheltered them, they weren't completely wiped out. Now... Su Yu really hadn't forgotten!

He had a good memory!

A grudge for a grudge, a grievance for a grievance!

The Xuan Armor Race too, Su Yu still remembered, and now wanted to exterminate them.

These races could only wait for death.

There was no escape!

The Great Qin King glanced at Su Yu, thinking Su Yu... was perhaps too vengeful, but after thinking about it, let it be. Su Yu had spoken, and it wouldn't be good to refute him now.

And Su Yu, with a calm expression.

What was the point of achieving fame and success?

It wasn't to laugh off grudges, but to settle them!

I said I'd destroy you, and I will!

Wait for death!

These races had provoked him in the past and nearly caused his death. If he didn't kill them, who would he kill?

At this moment, in several small realms, countless beings fled through the realm passages.

Fleeing to the heavens!

Even if the Allheaven Battlefield was filled with humans, it was better than being wiped out by humans!

The Xuan Armor Race, the Xuan Armor King wore a face of sorrow, not fleeing.

The weak could escape, but as an Eternal, he couldn't.

He could only fight to the death or choose to surrender and let the humans kill him, hoping they might leave a bit of foundation for the Xuan Armor Race.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was king of the heavens!

No one stood up to say it couldn't be done.

Killing 11 Daofuse, Su Yu's might surpassed everyone.

Unless the ancients returned, and the Culture King and others came back, but this wasn't their era. They existed only in legends, while Su Yu was a living myth!

...

At the same time.

Heavendoom Ancient City.

The Great Zhou King appeared instantly, appearing before four Shanhai. Not Shanhai, the Great Zhou King's eyes were sharp, seeing through their strength at a glance; they were all Eternal!

Not Shanhai Realm!

Indeed, Shanhai had long been reduced to ashes.

At this moment, the four strong individuals' expressions changed.

The Great Zhou King wore a smile on his face. "I am Zhou Tianqi, the Torchbearer of this generation. I suggest you visit the Human Realm and have a chat with Emperor Yu. Don't tell me anything now; save it for when you meet him. Also, I hope you all have some sense. You've witnessed everything today. If you don't want to die a miserable death, keep a low profile."

The group turned pale. The female powerhouse among them spoke softly, "Greetings, Senior. Thank you for the advice, and congratulations on your victory in this battle."

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "The credit goes to Emperor Yu. Don't get me into trouble."

The group exchanged uneasy glances.

"Let's go," the Great Zhou King said, "I'll give you a few pointers along the way. Take them seriously."

The middle-aged man among them spoke in a deep voice, "Please, enlighten us, Senior."

"First, answer whatever you're asked. Don't hide anything."

"Second, be respectful and avoid mentioning the Hundred Battle King."

"Third, do not contradict Emperor Yu."

"Fourth, the women... should speak less."

The female member of the group looked surprised. What did that mean?

The Great Zhou King didn't elaborate. Su Yu, that kid, wasn't fond of women and was always wary of them. He believed the Hundred Battle King had been tricked by a woman, so it was best for women to speak less around him to avoid any unnecessary trouble.

The middle-aged man asked, "Senior, is this Human Lord chosen by you?"

"Me?" The Great Zhou King laughed, "Don't bring that up. We don't choose the Human Lord. The Human Lord decides whether we exist! Emperor Yu isn't like the previous nine Human Lords. Whatever you think, your life is your own."

"Will he kill us?"

"Of course!"

The group fell silent.

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Why wouldn't he? Before this battle, you might have had some hope. But now that you've seen it, if you seek death, I don't mind granting your wish to avoid dragging others down! Being foolish once is fine, but if you're foolish multiple times, you might as well die!"

The group remained silent, following the Great Zhou King towards the Human Realm.

Moments later, a figure appeared in the void, causing the group to tense up.

They recognized him!

Wan Tiansheng!

The one who had just single-handedly killed the Nether Emperor, a terrifying existence.

"Director Wan!"

"Great Zhou King!"

Wan Tiansheng smiled as he looked at the four, "Are these the ones?"

"Yes."

"Four Eternals managed to come down? That's quite rare!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "There are probably more than just these few. Many others likely died. These ones were lucky, right?"

The middle-aged man among them looked pained but quickly replied, "Yes, there were 16 Eternals and 22 Sunmoon Realm cultivators, totaling 38. Only the four of us survived!"

"Quite lucky!"

The Great Zhou King smiled faintly, "To have four survive, your strength is average at best. Consider yourselves fortunate! Normally, without reaching the Daofuse Realm, you'd be torn apart! It seems the Upper Realm isn't doing well... But to send so many Eternals and Sunmoon Realm cultivators down, it must be manageable, not as dire as I imagined, with only seven or eight surviving."

The middle-aged man replied solemnly, "There aren't many Daofuse Realm cultivators left, but some strong ones protected a few people. There are still some powerful individuals."

The Great Zhou King nodded, not pressing further.

Wan Tiansheng, however, was interested and asked, "Were you together or scattered?"

"Scattered. We were under the command of Marquis Dingjun, who is also a Torchbearer..."

"So we're considered part of the Torchbearer lineage!"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "What kind of Torchbearer is he? In the last tide, his son was a Torchbearer, but he died. Just because his son was a Torchbearer, does that make him one too? Forget it, let's not discuss this. If you really want to count it, I suppose you could barely consider him one!"

The group dared not refute.

Before this, they might have dared, but not now.

The Lower Realm might be more terrifying than the Upper Realm.

That Su Yu, leading people to slay six Daofuse Realm experts in a day, forcing Tiangu and others to seal their realms. Tiangu, even if they were descending for the first time, was a familiar name, a spokesperson of the Immortal Realm.

Even in the Upper Realm, Tiangu had a considerable following.

They were quite apprehensive. The Great Zhou King had come directly, indicating that the Human Race had long known of their existence, which was terrifying. They thought they hadn't been exposed yet.

Turns out, they had been under surveillance all along!

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng transmitted, "Great Zhou King, how strong is Marquis Dingjun?"

"Not bad, probably comparable to Old Qin now."

"That's indeed not weak!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded slightly, quickly transmitting again, "Let's see how these people fare. Great Zhou King... don't provoke him further! Don't waste the trust we've just built for these Eternals from the Upper Realm."

The Great Zhou King nodded, not responding.

The trust he mentioned was the successful completion of the task Su Yu had given him, easily killing two marquises.

He was quite useful!

Su Yu should be in a good mood. If another conflict arose, even if he was useful... Wan Tiansheng worried that Su Yu might explode.

That kid had quite a temper.

...

At this moment, Su Yu wasn't concerned about these people.

He had mentioned wanting to see them, but it wasn't urgent. Why rush?

He didn't even bother to have someone follow them, just letting the Great Zhou King bring them over.

Right now, Su Yu wanted to see Lantian.

That was his main concern.

In the Imperial Hall.

Lantian had transformed into a little girl, smiling brightly at Su Yu, giving him a headache.

"Director Lan..."

"Brother Yu!"

The little girl Lantian called out, full of joy.

Su Yu's expression changed. I, Su Yu, have killed Daofuse Realm experts, fought against Heavenly Kings, and battled Martial Emperors. In the myriad realms today, there's no one I don't dare to fight or kill.

I'm fearless... but damn it, I'm a bit wary of Lantian.

There's no way to describe it!

If he were an enemy, I'd slap him to death. The problem is, Lantian has made significant contributions several times and has a close relationship with Wan Tiansheng. There's really nothing I can say.

Su Yu didn't dwell on the form of address. Lantian transformed into someone, adopting their emotions and personality, making it impossible to distinguish between real and fake. This was the brilliance of his avatar technique, everything vividly lifelike!

Su Yu quickly asked, "Have you buried the items?"

"Brother Yu, they're buried, but I couldn't get close to the God, Demon, and Immortal Realms. They're too powerful!"

"Are they in the other realms?"

"Yes, yes!"

The little girl nodded, delighted. "Am I amazing or what?"

"..."

Damn!

Truly impressive.

Su Yu quickly said, "I understand. Director Lan, you've made a significant contribution this time. Once I conquer a few realms, I'll let you witness the essence of the Great Dao. You can go and get busy now."

"I'm not busy..."

"No, you are!"

Su Yu said seriously, "Director Lantian, you have a lot to do! I need eyes and ears in the myriad realms. Have your avatars spread across the myriad realms? Are you present in all the realms?"

Lantian was taken aback, "That's... too many. I don't have that many avatars yet..."

"Exactly, which is why your Dao isn't complete. Go get busy, create more avatars. I want to see you in all the realms!"

Su Yu quickly continued, "After creating living beings, try creating undead avatars too! Once you've done that, attempt to send avatars to the Upper Realm! Intelligence is the foundation of our victory! Catch the enemy off guard. If they don't know me, but I know them inside out, how can I not win?"

Su Yu spoke rapidly, "And all of this depends on you, Director Lan! If I win and unify the heavens, Wan Tiansheng will be the Saint King, and you'll be the Saint Heavenly King. I've even thought of the titles for you!"

Lantian was stunned, standing up, "Alright, I'll go cultivate my avatars. You promised, no changing your mind!"

"Of course!"

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng, who had just reached the entrance of the hall, paused, his expression changing as he looked at Su Yu, a single word slowly rising in his mind—damn!

Do something human!

You're not even human!

Lantian, however, was overjoyed, bouncing like a child, happily leaving. Seeing Wan Tiansheng, he excitedly said, "Brother Tiansheng, I'm off to get busy!"

With that, he glanced at the four newcomers from the Upper Realm, giggling, "How interesting. Brother Yu, can I keep these people? I want to refine them; they feel a bit different from us!"

After speaking, the little girl bounced away.

The four people beside Wan Tiansheng had strange expressions.

This... they didn't recognize him.

Lantian?

They seemed to have heard of him, but they hadn't been in the Lower Realm long, and their intelligence was limited.

Su Yu, however, smiled and said, "Alright, if they don't listen, I'll leave them to you, Director Lan. Thank you for your hard work!"

"Brother Yu, don't mention it!"

Lantian didn't look back, bouncing away quickly.

As soon as Lantian left, the bustling Imperial Hall, filled with people playing, arguing, fighting, and reading, suddenly became silent. The hundreds of people vanished in an instant!

It was as if they had never existed!

The four newcomers felt a chill in their hearts. The lively Imperial Hall suddenly quieted down, sending shivers down their spines!

Even the Great Zhou King, following behind them, twitched slightly at the corners of his mouth.

This... Su Yu was incredibly indulgent with Lantian!

No one dared to approach the Imperial Hall. Lantian had created hundreds of avatars here. He had felt something was off earlier, but he hadn't expected that all of them were his avatars, even the dozen or so guards he thought Marquis Xia had assigned were actually Lantian's!

The Great Zhou King had a headache.

These people better behave. The scariest thing wasn't being slapped to death by Su Yu, but being handed over to Lantian. That would truly be a fate worse than death!

Wan Tiansheng didn't care about all that. At this moment, he was utterly exhausted.

Saint King?

Saint Heavenly King?

Are you kidding me!

He didn't say anything, entering the hall and saying, "Greetings, Emperor Yu. Wan Tiansheng of the Purification Department, accompanying the Great Zhou King, brings several guests from the Upper Realm to meet you!"

The Great Zhou King also bowed slightly. Su Yu smiled, looking at the four, but didn't speak.

He just smiled, and that smile sent chills down the spines of the four.

This wretched place, this Lower Realm... Why does it feel so eerie?

Wasn't it said in the Upper Realm that the tides here in the Lower Realm were weak?

Yet today, everyone I've seen—each one of them—fills me with dread. The more I see, the more my heart chills!

They seem even more terrifying than Marquis Dingjun!

Marquis Dingjun's aura is indeed powerful, but in the Upper Realm, his strength is at most comparable to Marquis Falling Star. Yet today, several experts of that level have perished.

The battles in the Lower Realm feel even more exaggerated than those in the Upper Realm!

As they pondered, unsure of what to say or how to express their thoughts, Su Yu merely smiled, a smile full of deep meaning.

Eternal!

And they are all alive, four of them. Besides the Realm of Life, perhaps I can also control a perfect passageway!

This indeed brings me great convenience!

Without mentioning anything else, just this point alone is enough for me to reap huge benefits.

Su Yu's smile grew increasingly radiant, causing the four to shiver with fear, while the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng could only sigh helplessly. Please, restrain yourself a bit. Even we feel somewhat uneasy!
