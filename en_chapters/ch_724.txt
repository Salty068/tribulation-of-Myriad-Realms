Chapter 724: Playing with Fireworks

The moment they arrived, they managed to take down two Heavenly Kings, a surprisingly smooth operation. The Four Heavenly Kings were being held back by the Hundred Battle King, allowing the Great Zhou King and Marquis Huoyun to suppress their opponents. The two of them were enough to handle two Heavenly Kings, while the remaining forces joined together to encircle the others.

"Hahaha!" The Hundred Battle King laughed wildly. His projection was about to appear, and at this moment, two of the six chains binding him had already broken. The remaining four chains were still being held back by the Great Zhou King and his allies. The Hundred Battle King felt that he could finally break free.

He roared, venting his emotions, "Kill them! Kill one or two more, and this king will be unsealed! Slaughter these beasts!" After waiting for six thousand years, he finally saw hope. The group that came to rescue him was strong, including two quasi-king level beings, which even surprised the Hundred Battle King.

He roared, shaking the heavens and the earth. The mountains trembled violently, countless rocks shattered, and a faint aura began to seep out. Dao Yu, who was engaged in battle with Su Yu, changed his expression. He hadn't expected two Heavenly Kings to be killed in the blink of an eye. It was too fast! Where did these bastards come from?

If one or two more died, the Hundred Battle King might really break free. Once he was out, who could match him? "Damn it!" Dao Yu cursed. Eight quasi-kings were stationed here, yet they were still breached. He couldn't believe that the Human Realm still had such power to rescue the Hundred Battle King. How many strong individuals were hidden within Chaos Mountain?

Although he could suppress Su Yu in their fight, it wasn't easy to determine a victor or life and death in a battle between Heavenly Kings. The opponent wasn't as strong as him, but capturing him wasn't simple either. The more the Hundred Battle King struggled, the more power the Four Heavenly Kings had to exert to suppress him. Initially, they were evenly matched, but now, the Four Heavenly Kings were being suppressed by the Great Zhou King and his allies.

The four of them gradually gathered together, forced to unite. Together, they had hope; separated, they risked being surrounded and killed by this group. Their power of laws was violently shaking. Below, the Hundred Battle King struggled madly. Having been stifled for countless years, he was driven to madness. Seeing an opportunity, he showed no mercy, continuously breaking the chains binding him. These chains were constantly regenerating, consuming the power of laws from several strong individuals.

...

Su Yu, engaged in battle with Dao Yu, revealed a barely noticeable hint of joy in his eyes. The encirclement was complete! At this moment, as long as they suppressed these four Heavenly Kings, their strength would plummet, breaking the stalemate. These individuals would soon be killed, and the plan would be accomplished!

As for the Hundred Battle King... if things continued as they were, there was hope for him to break free and escape. The premise was that he only fled and didn't foolishly engage the strong forces here; otherwise, he was still doomed to die! Killing six Heavenly Kings was enough! If they were lucky, they could surround and kill Dao Yu and the Blood Demon. If not, it didn't matter; Su Yu's goal wasn't to kill as many as possible this time.

Su Yu was about to use the Little Stone to suppress the four of them when suddenly, Dao Yu became anxious, angry, and frustrated. The four were struggling to hold on! "Do you really think this is your Chaos Mountain, where you can come and go as you please?" Dao Yu roared, and the next moment, he shouted, "Blood Demon!"

Behind him, the Blood Demon, who was fiercely battling Lantian, had countless avatars. Yes, Lantian had countless avatars too. Numerous Blood Demons and Lantian avatars fought in the void. Hearing Dao Yu's voice, the Blood Demon sneered coldly, "This should have been done earlier, but you and I... will likely be held accountable!"

"Stop talking nonsense!" Dao Yu roared, not caring about anything else at this moment. Initially, he hadn't expected to lose so quickly. He hadn't expected two of the six Heavenly Kings to die so easily, thinking he could capture them himself. The Blood Demon sneered and said no more. The next moment, dozens of Blood Demons gathered together and suddenly exploded! The speed was incredibly fast! Several of Lantian's avatars were blown to pieces by the self-detonating Blood Demons. The blood mist from the explosion spread everywhere.

Dao Yu, who was fighting Su Yu, quickly retreated. Su Yu's expression changed slightly. What was happening? He saw Dao Yu suddenly produce a divine character, which was immensely powerful, and it instantly fell into the blood mist. The rolling blood mist solidified in an instant! Gradually, spatial fluctuations emanated from it.

In the distance, the Great Zhou King, who was engaged in battle, suddenly changed his expression and shouted, "Retreat! It's a Blood Path portal, retreat quickly!" Although Su Yu didn't fully understand, he could sense the spatial fluctuations. Coupled with the Great Zhou King's words, he had already guessed what was happening.

Sure enough, Dao Yu no longer retreated but instead pressed forward, coldly saying, "A bunch of fools, courting death! You came once thousands of years ago and escaped, yet you dare to come again!" "This is not your territory!" He was furious! He and the Blood Demon were the leaders among the eight, and today, they would surely be held accountable. Even if they killed these people, they might still be held accountable. The best outcome now was to leave none of these fools alive.

In the distance, the blood mist instantly transformed into a portal. As the portal gradually opened, it seemed to connect to a distant place, opening a spatial door for some existence. A voice, ancient and hoarse, came from the other side of the portal, "Do you need my help?" The Blood Demon immediately shouted, "Please awaken, Dao Brother!"

"Alright... give me a moment." A torrent of demonic energy surged from the other side. This portal seemed to connect to a supreme demonic path existence. Su Yu's heart skipped a beat! The Heaven Gate opened instantly! Looking through the portal, it seemed to see far away. Su Yu's expression changed again as he looked underground. Damn! A top-tier supreme being in slumber! It was right beneath the sealed mountain!

Su Yu hadn't noticed before because the other party seemed to have severed the connection to the Great Dao, falling into absolute slumber. Now, with the sealed mountain's changes, the Blood Demon and Dao Yu were awakening the being. "Ten seconds!" Su Yu was startled but not panicked. A supreme being not yet fully awakened! Awakening took time. That's why the other party said to wait a moment. From awakening to connecting with the Great Dao and emerging, it would likely take about ten seconds.

All thoughts flashed instantly. The next moment, a Little Stone flew directly towards the Great Zhou King and his allies. At this moment, the Great Zhou King was extremely tense, shouting repeatedly, feeling the demonic energy, and exclaimed in horror, "It's the aura of Marquis Motian, he's not dead!" Not only did he recognize it, but those ancient strong individuals did too. Marquis Huoyun and the others were all changing colors. This old thing had disappeared for many years; they thought he was long dead, but he was merely in deep slumber.

At this moment, the entire sealed mountain was filled with turbulent demonic energy! The roaring Hundred Battle King also changed his expression slightly, and the next moment, he roared, "Quick, kill these bastards, and I will break the seal and kill this Motian!" He was anxious! He wasn't familiar with Marquis Motian, hadn't fought him, but he felt the aura, definitely a top-tier quasi-king. However, after shouting, he felt a bit helpless and desperate. It's over! There's no time!

These guys couldn't kill the four quasi-kings. Although they could suppress them, there wasn't enough time. The Hundred Battle King was also extremely angry! There was a bastard sleeping beneath him all these years, and he didn't even know it.

...

On Su Yu's side, Dao Yu instantly pressed forward, not only that, but he also shouted, "Hold them back!" Now, it was their turn to hold back Su Yu and his allies. Marquis Motian was about to emerge! The reason for choosing to seal here was because a powerful existence was in slumber here. Thousands of years ago, they hadn't had the chance to use it, and the person escaped. Escaping once wasn't enough; they dared to come a second time?

Three seconds! At this moment, Su Yu quickly judged and calculated. Three seconds had passed. "Suppress!" A loud shout, a signal. "Kill!" The Great Zhou King, who had been shouting, burned his blood essence at this moment, roaring, pushing his endurance to the limit. The Four Heavenly Kings' movements noticeably stalled! Torrential flames also rose instantly! General Yingwu and the others also erupted instantly, going all out, regardless of the cost.

Initially, everyone was shouting to retreat, but Su Yu hadn't given the order, and they remembered his previous instructions. Only he could give orders on this battlefield, and these ancient marquises ultimately chose to listen to Su Yu. The Four Heavenly Kings had already been significantly weakened. At this moment, the endurance burst caused them to stall slightly. This stall was nothing. But the key was that a powerful suppressive force suddenly emanated from the Little Stone, seemingly sharing the same root as their Great Dao. The stone instantly expanded a million times, pressing down!

Like a giant mountain suppressing! The four Great Dao forces, under normal circumstances, couldn't be severed. However, when the stone expanded and pressed down, it directly severed their connection to the Great Dao. The connection to the Great Dao seemed to break! Normally, breaking the connection wouldn't be a big deal. But at this moment, in the midst of a life-and-death battle, it was a disaster!

The Four Heavenly Kings' expressions changed drastically, their auras plummeting. The suppression effect was even more terrifying than Su Yu had imagined! Originally possessing top-tier Daofuse combat power, their auras fell to third, fourth, even fifth-tier Daofuse power in the blink of an eye, still dropping! Given time, they might regain some control over the Great Dao. But at this moment, who had time for that? Who had time to seize control?

Boom! Everyone's attacks arrived instantly! A deafening explosion echoed through the heavens and the earth. The Four Heavenly Kings' faces showed disbelief, despair, and shock.

A decrepit old Heavenly King suddenly roared, "No, the Great Dao has been severed, changing the Dao... it's a conspiracy..."

Boom!

Before he could finish, he was shattered into pieces! In his final moment, he realized something!

The Dao cannot be changed. This Dao has a problem.

The four of them were almost instantly cut off from the Great Dao, an impossibility for top-tier experts unless there was something wrong with the Dao itself.

Dao Yu, who was engaged in battle with Su Yu, shuddered in disbelief and shock. What was happening?

The four Heavenly Kings' auras plummeted in an instant, and then they were jointly obliterated by the Great Zhou King and his allies on the spot! These four top-tier beings were killed with such ease, it felt no harder than slaying a few top-tier Eternals!

Eight seconds!

Meanwhile, Su Yu was calculating the time. The next moment, he shouted, "Hundred Battle King, unseal, charge down, stop that person!"

The Hundred Battle King was also violently shaken! The chains binding him suddenly snapped. Only one chain remained, not from these six, but from the Control King's lineage, the final seal.

At this moment, the six external Great Daos binding him had all shattered!

The Hundred Battle King was also in shock, having given up hope while still bound, never expecting such a sudden turn of events. Hearing Su Yu's voice, the voice of that quasi-king, he couldn't care about much else!

I... I seem to be able to unseal!

He laughed maniacally, boom! His aura surged boundlessly!

In an instant, a terrifying aura erupted, piercing through the clouds, and the Seal Mountain exploded with a thunderous roar! The grand formation was also shattered by him in an instant!

The Great Ming King, who was maintaining the formation, spat out a mouthful of blood, helplessly watching as a monstrous aura erupted from this place!

The formation was breached!

The Hundred Battle King erupted directly; how could the Great Ming King withstand it?

"Hahaha!"

A wild laugh echoed, and the Hundred Battle King was overjoyed, "Mere scoundrels dare to slumber with this king here?"

Boom!

The Hundred Battle King punched downward!

Boom!

The entire mountain exploded!

The power of blood and qi surged into the sky. Even with the last seal still in place, the Hundred Battle King was immensely powerful. With one punch, he created a chasm in the earth, and below, a newly awakened demonic path expert, about to step into the teleportation gate, hesitated slightly.

He was about to teleport up, but the Seal Mountain was obliterated by the Hundred Battle King's punch!

The newly awakened Demon Marquis faced the newly unsealed Hundred Battle King!

The Demon Marquis, with an ancient appearance and fluctuating aura, looked at the Hundred Battle King and smiled, "You really unsealed... but alas, the last seal seems unbroken... Hundred Battle... I know of you, but we've never fought..."

"Too much nonsense, die!"

Boom!

The Hundred Battle King's body shattered the void, and with a punch, the world changed color!

Even without fully breaking the seal, he was a top-tier existence.

With this punch, the Demon Marquis below fully awakened, the previous confusion from awakening completely dissipated, replaced by a solemn expression.

What a Hundred Battle!

He too manifested a long spear, sweeping it out, shattering the void!

In the blink of an eye, the two collided!

Their speed was incredibly fast!

The ground below collapsed as the Hundred Battle King descended, madly pounding downward, creating a ten-thousand-meter deep pit in the blink of an eye!

The Hundred Battle King laughed wildly, "This king is unsealed! I'll kill those two pests above, and after I finish off this old thing, I'll kill him thoroughly!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King ignored him, leading a group to kill several Heavenly Kings, swiftly flying towards Su Yu.

Today, only Su Yu's words mattered!

Su Yu also ignored the Hundred Battle King.

Idiot!

You keep playing; I have no time to play with you. Killing a few Heavenly Kings, what's the point?

Just killing for fun!

His Heaven Gate opened, sweeping the surroundings.

Soon, he saw seven or eight Daofuse powers rapidly moving towards this place. These were not frightening; Su Yu was not afraid of them.

He swept over them, his heart trembling.

Indeed!

The commotion from the Hundred Battle King's unsealing was too great. Two immensely powerful Daos he had seen before were rapidly moving towards this place.

One was the strong presence on the mountain he had seen first.

The other was the domineering presence he had seen that day, residing above a great river.

Both were heading this way.

And the Destiny Marquis, whose Dao power fluctuated, seemed to want to come but ultimately restrained himself and did not move.

March's Dao power also fluctuated, seemingly hesitating, but ultimately, March's Dao power also moved this way, clearly sensing the Hundred Battle King's unsealing and deciding to come over.

Not only that, Su Yu looked again and suddenly discovered another Dao power rising abruptly, heading this way.

That was someone Su Yu hadn't noticed before, buried in the earth.

Five peerless experts!

Except for the Destiny Marquis, four were rapidly approaching.

Before they arrived, a voice already came through.

"Demon Heaven, entangle him!"

With a cold voice, a strong presence directly sent a message!

Entangle the Hundred Battle!

Do not let this guy escape.

The Hundred Battle King, who was madly attacking, changed color slightly, damn it!

These guys were all nearby!

He wanted to retreat, but the Demon Marquis below laughed wildly, demonic energy soaring into the sky, instantly counterattacking the Hundred Battle King!

This one was also a top-tier existence.

The not fully unsealed Hundred Battle King, fighting him, could barely suppress the Demon Marquis, showing how terrifying the Hundred Battle King was, yet he could only barely suppress him.

At this moment, under the opponent's counterattack, he was completely unable to free himself to do anything else.

Meanwhile, on Su Yu's side, Dao Yu and Blood Demon quickly converged.

Both were pale.

At times shocked, at times delighted.

On one hand, shocked that the six Heavenly Kings were killed, shocked that the Hundred Battle King really escaped, on the other hand, delighted that this was their territory after all, and those long-absent experts finally emerged!

All were rapidly approaching!

And the Great Zhou King and others, quickly arriving, were all somewhat tense.

Not much joy!

Although they killed six Heavenly Kings, it seemed more powerful experts were coming now.

Very tense!

Everyone looked at Su Yu, what to do?

Escape now?

If they didn't escape soon, it would be too late!

Killing a few people was enough.

As for the Hundred Battle King... no way, couldn't care about him.

"Thirty seconds!"

Su Yu looked at those Daos, observing their speed, the fastest being the one emerging from the earth, likely arriving within thirty seconds.

Dao Yu and Blood Demon were not easy to kill.

Turning to look below, at the Hundred Battle King.

Su Yu squinted his eyes, the next moment, he shouted, "Hundred Battle King, Lord Moon Luo awaits your return, retreat quickly!"

"Moon Luo?"

"Roar!"

Suddenly, the Hundred Battle King let out a beast-like roar, the Demon Marquis dragging him down was suddenly struck by his frenzied outburst, continuously falling and spitting blood!

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King's eyes were blood-red, seemingly going mad!

Moon Luo!

Were these people sent by Moon Luo?

No!

He recognized Marquis Dingjun and the others, could it be that Marquis Dingjun and the others were also gathered by Moon Luo?

"Did Moon Luo send you?"

He roared, filled with anger and madness.

Were these people sent by Moon Luo?

However, Su Yu no longer cared about him.      Go mad, the better!

"Form the array!"

Su Yu shouted again, the Great Ming King, who was spitting blood, said nothing, immediately setting up another grand formation.

As soon as this formation appeared, the Hundred Battle King seemed to recognize it, roaring madly, "You really were sent by her, Dingjun, you betrayed this king too!"

Marquis Dingjun cursed silently!

Crazy?

Who betrayed whom!

I don't even know what's going on, didn't we just release you?

Why are you still picking a fight!

He didn't think much, and the Great Ming King had already set up the formation, this time sealing the area where Su Yu and the others were, the Great Ming King knowing Su Yu's intention, setting up the array, likely targeting these two!

Dao Yu and Blood Demon both trembled!

Dao Yu, with a look of shock, angrily said, "Are you crazy? Don't you want to live?"

Several powerful beings were about to arrive!

He didn't stop Su Yu and the others, which was already good enough, yet these people seemed to want to deal with them!

Crazy?

Are we that easy to deal with?

Soon, several top-tier beings would arrive.

According to Dao Yu's thinking, these people should be fleeing at this moment.

Su Yu ignored them, and the others, seeing Su Yu's stance, understood his intention. The Great Zhou King, though terrified, knew that on this battlefield, only by listening to Su Yu could they have a chance at victory!

And Su Yu, with a fierce look in his eyes!

Suddenly, the Mark of Civilization appeared.

This time, he didn't unseal the West King's Consort, but directly tore off the book cover of the Mark of Civilization!

This book cover... was discarded!

Rebuild it later!

Not just the book cover, at this moment, the Sanctification Seal appeared.

This thing was the true treasure.

Left by the Culture King to deal with the Martial Emperor.

Who was the Martial Emperor?

He was the master of rules!

The Sanctification Seal was instantly taken out by Su Yu, shooting towards the two Heavenly Kings.

"Kill!"

Su Yu shouted!

The Sanctification Seal suddenly erupted with a power of the sacred path, seemingly accompanied by a grand voice in the void, "Submit!"

It seemed to be the voice of the Culture King!

Suppressing everything!

Dao Yu and Blood Demon were both highly vigilant, now burning their blood essence without hesitation, originally thinking of fighting Su Yu and his group, dragging it out until the other supreme beings arrived.

But just as they thought this, their eyes suddenly turned dazed.

Submit!

Yes, submit.

Only this thought remained.

We must submit!

And beside Su Yu, the Great Zhou King and others quickly acted, the Great Zhou King's path of patience now exerted to the extreme, further bewildering the two top-tier beings.

The two powerful beings were now left with only instinctive reactions.

Su Yu waved his hand, and Little Stone instantly suppressed them!

Everything happened with unparalleled speed.

In the midst of a chaotic battlefield, two formidable True Dao experts, even in their confusion, could instinctively retaliate if attacked. A fierce enough assault might even awaken them from their stupor. Su Yu had already torn off the cover of the Mark of Civilization, removing the large characters inscribed upon it.

At this moment, the West King's Consort sensed something amiss. The oppressive force of the surrounding space seemed to have loosened, and she could feel the sealed power of her Great Dao. With a mix of surprise and bewilderment, she wondered if her kin had come to rescue her. Could they have descended so quickly? Even if they had, it would take time and opportunity to reach her.

However, her expression soon shifted. The fluctuations in her Great Dao were too intense. Had Su Yu tampered with her Great Dao during the sealing process? It was highly possible, given that he had opened the Heaven Gate, making it easy for him to detect her Great Dao's power.

The West King's Consort hesitated, contemplating whether to break free now. But suddenly, a powerful force of detonation surged towards her. Her face changed dramatically. Was Su Yu planning to perish together with her? Was he trying to kill her?

"Break!" she shouted, unable to care about anything else. The opportunity was rare, and she had to seize it to break free from the seal.

Outside, Su Yu hurled the book cover towards the two Heavenly Kings. Simultaneously, he unleashed a powerful attack, transforming his pen dao into a blade, and with a low roar, he slashed out—a single strike aimed at three targets.

Dao Yu and the Blood Demon sensed the impending crisis. At this moment, Lantian and the others launched their strongest attacks. Dao Yu and the Blood Demon suddenly regained clarity, their expressions changing as they saw the book cover. They recalled the earlier scene with Marquis Zhennan. Yes, they sensed a powerful presence within the book cover, someone who would self-destruct upon release, just like the Heavenly King who had been blown to pieces moments ago.

Dao Yu roared, shaking off the influence of the Sanctification Seal. "Kill! Don't let them self-destruct!" he shouted at the Blood Demon. They had witnessed this tactic earlier and couldn't allow the entity within to self-destruct.

The organization was terrifyingly formidable. Marquis Zhennan had self-destructed without hesitation, and this one seemed no different. The Blood Demon and Dao Yu, without further ado, unleashed their full power, striking towards the book.

The book shattered, and as the West King's Consort emerged, her face twisted in horror. Two Heavenly King-level experts were unleashing their full power against her, giving her no time to react, think, or escape. She had only one option: fight back and withstand the attack.

Desperate, the West King's Consort, whose physical body had been previously destroyed, was now incredibly frail. However, her Great Dao's power remained. With a fierce surge of her Great Dao, a formidable sealing force erupted, aiming to seal the two attackers.

Boom!

Just as her power rose, their attacks descended upon her. With a thunderous crash, her frail body shattered into dust, her Great Dao trembling violently. Yet, in her final moment, her sealing power descended, locking Dao Yu and the Blood Demon in place. At this point, Su Yu and his allies' attacks landed with full force.

Everyone was giving their all. Su Yu, in particular, roared, his voice shaking the heavens. "Lady Ziyan!" he called out.

Ziyan, her body shattered and her sea of will on the brink of collapse, was bewildered. Who was calling her? Oh, Su Yu! That beast, what was he shouting? Lady? How laughable! Was he trying to surrender? And where was she? Who were the two Heavenly Kings she had just encountered? They seemed familiar... Why had they attacked her?

Countless thoughts swirled in her mind, and she seemed to hear Su Yu's anguished cry again: "Lady Ziyan sacrificed herself for our Chaos Race, avenge her!"

"For the great cause of our Chaos Race, kill!"

Boom!

A series of incredibly powerful attacks surged forth. Dao Yu and the Blood Demon, having been suppressed by the Sanctification Seal and locked by Ziyan's Great Dao, had just unleashed their full power. Their power of laws was greatly depleted, and they hadn't had time to recover before being further suppressed by Little Stone's power of laws.

At this moment, seeing Su Yu and his allies driven to madness, seeking revenge for the woman, Dao Yu and the Blood Demon were filled with despair and helplessness. Wasn't it the woman herself who wanted to self-destruct? They hadn't forced her to do it. If they hadn't acted, her self-destruction would have ended them both.

Exchanging a glance, both showed a hint of despair and unwillingness. Fine, if they couldn't have peace, then everyone... would die together! They noticed that the woman's sea of will hadn't completely shattered. With determination, they decided to self-destruct as well. The Chaos Race was ruthless, treating the self-destruction of top experts as child's play.

"Even in death, we'll take someone with us!" With this thought, they ignored Su Yu and his allies' attacks, determined to drag Ziyan down with them. The previous Marquis Zhennan hadn't had his sea of will shattered, and they wouldn't let this one escape either.

Boom!

In the next instant, two massive explosions erupted almost simultaneously. The grand formation shattered, and Ziyan's sea of will, in a daze, suddenly exploded, shattered by the overwhelming force.

Ziyan's phantom appeared briefly, filled with confusion. Where was she? Weren't her kin supposed to rescue her? Why did she feel deceived? Her phantom glanced at the self-destructing duo, seemingly recognizing them. Blood Demon and Dao Yu? Two powerful ancient marquises! Weren't they in the Upper Realm? This seemed like the Dao Source Land. Had she come to the Upper Realm? So now, was she dead?

Ziyan, filled with confusion, while Blood Demon and Dao Yu, in their final moments, unleashed a wave of resentment. "Ziyan, Chaos Race... will never rest until death!"

They recognized Marquis Dingjun and the others, needing no further words. These people had just joined this race. But Ziyan seemed to be a significant figure within the Chaos Race. Ziyan! Chaos Race! The wave of resentment quickly spread.

Su Yu's face changed dramatically as he shouted, "Clean up the battlefield, eliminate the resentment..." As he spoke, the tattered Mark of Civilization swept across the area. Su Yu glanced again, seeing the power of the Great Dao drawing near.

"Ten seconds to arrival!" Su Yu's brow furrowed as he commanded, "Retreat!" Everyone, some still reeling from the impact, like the Great Ming King, who was coughing up blood, quickly converged on Su Yu.

Su Yu swiftly gathered them into the Mark of Civilization, shouting, "Don't resist!" Then, he collected everyone, looking down at the Hundred Battle King, and shouted, "Hundred Battle, escape! Come to Chaos Mountain to find us. Lady Yueluo is waiting for you. It was all a misunderstanding back then! Lady Yueluo truly loves you!"

"Roar!" The Hundred Battle King let out a beast-like roar. "Misunderstanding?" he raged. "How could it be a misunderstanding? Yueluo! You wretch, even if you saved me, I won't spare you!"

The Hundred Battle King roared in fury. How could it be a misunderstanding? At the peak of his life, just as he was about to complete his ancient conquest, he was betrayed and sold out. This blow had filled him with resentment for six thousand years. It wasn't a misunderstanding! Yueluo, even if you sent someone to save me, I won't spare you! Chaos Mountain, is it? I'll go there! I definitely will! So, you're hiding in Chaos Mountain!

At this moment, the entire Sealed Mountain shattered and vanished, releasing torrents of overwhelming power of laws. The battle had lasted approximately three minutes. In those three minutes, nine Heavenly Kings had fallen! Yes, nine! Everyone felt it, one powerful force of laws after another exploding. Not one or two, but nine in total! Like nine fireworks, they rose into the sky of the Dao Source Land, expanding and magnifying.

In the Dao Source Land, everyone turned towards the Sealed Mountain, filled with shock and fear. Such a massive disturbance, it seemed like all the fallen were quasi-kings! Not just one or two, but nine at once! The Chaos Race! And the Hundred Battle King was unsealed!

...

Sealed Mountain.

Su Yu swiftly tore through the River of Time to escape. Shortly after his departure, a figure appeared, emanating a dense power of earth. Seeing the fleeing Hundred Battle King, their eyes turned cold. "Trying to run?" No way! With a punch, a massive mountain descended to suppress.

This giant punched down, shouting, "Heavenly Venerable Mo, intercept those people in the River of Time!" In the distance, a purple-haired expert from the mountain nodded slightly, a serious expression on their face. A battle had claimed nine quasi-kings! The loss was unimaginable! Those people had fled into the River of Time, and he couldn't let them escape.

"Heavenly Venerable Ming, assist them in capturing the Hundred Battle King. If not, kill him!" the purple-haired expert commanded, looking in another direction. There, a powerful figure from the river, exuding icy coldness, nodded. "You go after those people!"

Three top experts had come to aid, along with Mo Tian, making four top experts in total! The purple-haired expert also tore through the River of Time to pursue Su Yu and his group. Although the other side had two quasi-kings, he wasn't concerned. Those people couldn't escape! He would definitely kill them!

Meanwhile, the Hundred Battle King, somewhat clear-headed now, was furious. Soon, two top existences appeared, joining Mo Tian. Three top experts charged at him together. "Damn it!" the Hundred Battle King roared in anger. Damn bastards! This Dao Source Land was filled with their people!

"Kill!" The Hundred Battle King began to break through, fighting the three top experts fiercely. He seemed to sense someone's presence, shouting, "March, help me!" Yes, he sensed March's presence.

...

In the distance.

March, carrying a large bamboo, glanced around, sensing another aura rising nearby.

Chapter 741: The Unforeseen Turn

Not only that, but the aura of several Heavenly Kings surged forth, and a large number of Daofuse cultivators quickly gathered!

March assessed the situation and immediately chose to retreat. There was no saving them! Hundred Battle was the core target here, with too many powerful beings involved. Even if he intervened, he couldn't change the outcome. 

With a glance, March twisted his body and swiftly departed. He wouldn't get involved! Rescuing someone required the right opportunity, and clearly, this wasn't it. That fool, Hundred Battle, why didn't he escape when he broke free? If he had, they could have engaged in guerrilla warfare. If the opportunity was right, March might have been able to assist, and together with Hundred Battle, they might have had a chance to escape as long as they weren't surrounded.

"Hundred Battle, you fool... sigh!"

March left, and nearby, a figure emerged with a solemn expression, then sighed in relief. March had chosen to leave! That was good news. If March had decided to join the battle and cooperate with Hundred Battle, it might have resulted in significant losses today.

The newly appeared figure glanced in the direction March had left, squinted slightly, and without saying more, quickly flew towards the distant Sealed Mountain to join the encirclement of Hundred Battle. If they couldn't seal him again, they would kill him! Damn it, the Chaos Race! They actually broke the seal this time! They killed eight quasi-kings! And on their side, only one quasi-king had fallen! Hopefully, the Demon Heaven Sovereign could catch up to those bastards and kill them!

...

At this moment, nine massive clouds of fireworks spread out continuously. Nine beings standing at the pinnacle of the Myriad Realms had fallen today.

Over at Bamboo Mountain, it took a while for everyone to sense the disturbance. Marquis Giant Bamboo instantly flew out, followed by several other beasts. A row of Iron Devourer Beasts soared into the sky, looking towards the east!

The next moment, there was a collective gasp. Mouths opened wide, and the sound of jaws nearly dislocating echoed. April, May, September, Full Moon, and Marquis Giant Bamboo all gaped towards the east. Marquis Giant Bamboo's eyes widened, perfectly round, and the bamboo he was chewing fell from his mouth.

He stared at September, his mouth opening and closing, unable to make a sound for a long time. Finally, in a dry voice, he said, "Did... nine quasi-kings die?"

Did I see that wrong? Damn!

Marquis Giant Bamboo's eyes were so wide they couldn't retract. It had nothing to do with Su Yu and his group, right? It couldn't be related! Impossible! Su Yu's side only had one quasi-king. Even if they went berserk, they couldn't have killed so many quasi-kings!

September also had his mouth wide open. He quickly glanced at the small bamboo ring on his claw and sighed in relief. Blue Sky seemed to still be alive. That meant the dead quasi-kings didn't include Blue Sky. Since Blue Sky wasn't dead, it was fine.

Suddenly, an eye and a mouth appeared on the bamboo ring. "Emperor Yu asked me to pass a message. Was it satisfying? If so, listen up. Goodbye!" With a bang, the bamboo ring exploded!

September's face changed. "They might be in danger!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo opened his mouth, and after a long pause, he said dryly, "Killed nine quasi-kings... and they're not dead?"

Danger, isn't that expected? I sensed several incredibly powerful auras rising! Is this Source of the Dao going to be blown up?

At this moment, the row of Iron Devourer Beasts was utterly shocked. How did these guys manage that? Can they even come back alive?

Marquis Giant Bamboo wiped the nonexistent sweat from his forehead and looked at September with a peculiar expression. "Dear great-grandson's great-grandson... you said Emperor Yu holds grudges! If he comes back alive... will he seek revenge on us?"

What was I thinking, sending them to kill three Daofuse cultivators? Damn, they went and killed Heavenly Kings instead! Not just one or two! This... is too ruthless! I'm afraid they'll come back for revenge!

Even Blue Sky's bamboo ring exploded, clearly indicating that they hadn't escaped danger yet.

September opened his mouth, and after a long pause, he said foolishly, "Don't worry, ancestor. Just listen to me in the future. Hand over the Iron Devourer Race's authority to me, and we'll be on the same side. April, May, and you, ancestor, should all step down. I'll be the leader of the Iron Devourer Race, and there won't be any problems!"

Several Iron Devourer Beasts instantly looked at him. Those words... had multiple meanings! You're going to be our leader? For a moment, the Iron Devourer Beasts were in a daze. Then, looking at the nine fireworks clouds, Marquis Giant Bamboo nodded slightly, "Alright!"

April and May exchanged glances and remained silent. Whatever you say! Su Yu and his group were too crazy, a bit terrifying. September was also sighing! I'm... the leader now. This feeling, this position, came too quickly, too easily. No choice, Emperor Yu was too crazy, even the ancestor was scared. Told to kill three Daofuse cultivators, they went and killed nine quasi-kings! Anyone would be scared.

"Hope... they return safely!" September still prayed in his heart. Blue Sky's last words came, and then the bamboo ring exploded, clearly indicating they encountered danger and couldn't maintain their avatars anymore!
