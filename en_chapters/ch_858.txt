Chapter 858: Su Yu Takes Charge

The Great Zhou King—was he a hero or a villain? It all depended on one's perspective.

The most tragic figure, however, was Liu Wenyan. He was the true genius of the past decades, and that was no exaggeration. As a cultivator who hadn't even reached the Skysoar Realm, he bore the burden of Sunmoon Realm characters without his sea of will collapsing. Even Su Yu had never attempted such a feat; he might not have succeeded.

During that golden era, even figures like Xia Longwu played second fiddle to Liu Wenyan. People like Lord Xia Hou centered their activities around him. The Great Zhou King intended for Liu Wenyan to inherit the pen dao and the path of the Culture King. This was evident from the many powerful characters Liu Wenyan inherited. Yet, in the end, Liu Wenyan did not succeed.

Perhaps Liu Wenyan was also considered a discarded pawn by the Great Zhou King. Due to his continuous failures, the Great Zhou King grew disappointed and eventually gave up on him. Some matters were likely more complex than they appeared.

Su Yu was Liu Wenyan's student, having been under his tutelage for five years. Su Yu couldn't forgive the Great Zhou King on Liu Wenyan's behalf. As for himself, he could only choose to forget, as he didn't know how to handle such a situation.

Was the Great Zhou King a hero? Yes. At least during this tide, he had protected the human race from beginning to end. Otherwise, humanity might have been wiped out long ago. The failure of the Ninth Tide made the Great Zhou King more vigilant and ruthless. Sacrificing a small number of people became his choice, and among those sacrificed were Liu Wenyan and his peers.

At this moment, Su Yu chose not to dwell on these matters. The Human Emperor and others also fell silent. Su Yu was one of the involved parties, as was the Great Zhou King, and even more so, Su Yu's teacher. These matters were difficult to judge as right or wrong.

It was like when Bai Feng asked Su Yu long ago if sacrificing a squad of a hundred soldiers to kill an enemy expert was worth it. Su Yu initially said it was worth it. But when Bai Feng asked if his father was among those hundred soldiers, Su Yu quickly changed his tune, declaring he would kill anyone who dared do such a thing. That was human nature.

The Human Emperor, sensing the heavy atmosphere, cleared his throat and said, "Su Yu, come over here. Let's talk about something else. I have something to discuss with you."

He called Su Yu away, hoping to break the tense atmosphere that might otherwise persist.

The two walked to a secluded area. The Human Emperor sighed softly, "I'm sorry."

Su Yu replied calmly, "Why say such things, Human Emperor?"

The Human Emperor spoke softly, "This matter started with me, with the Culture King and others. When the Culture King left, it was a setup. When I led the myriad races away, it was also a setup. We were being plotted against, and we plotted in return. It was all about going with the flow. You are setting up your plans, and I am setting up mine. But my side made a misstep, leading to the Ninth Tide's upheaval and Hundred Battle's betrayal."

The Culture King's departure to the Heaven Gate was partly to save his sister and partly to counter the Heaven Gate. However, the Culture King was no match for that entity and has yet to succeed. The Human Emperor led the myriad races into the River of Time, moving against the current, intending to suppress the Three Gates. Otherwise, the myriad races of that era might not have betrayed us.

The Martial King's departure might have been at the Human Emperor's behest to aid the Culture King, a point the Human Emperor had hinted at before. From the Human Emperor's perspective, all of this was necessary. However, plans do not always succeed, and his arrangements in the myriad realms encountered errors.

At this moment, the one affected was Su Yu. The Human Emperor had to step forward and take responsibility to prevent Su Yu from harboring certain thoughts.

But Su Yu remained calm, "I've long moved past that phase, past the time of blaming the heavens and the earth, past the era of lamenting the world's injustice. It can only be said that I wasn't strong enough, which is why I want to become stronger and reverse everything."

"Perhaps the Great Zhou King was right... At least he forced me to find ways to strengthen myself."

Su Yu's lips curled into a mocking smile, a self-deprecating one. "From the day I cried out to the heavens and received no answer, I told myself that in this world, everything depends on oneself—on fists, on wisdom, on intellect. When faced with trouble, solve it yourself."

The Human Emperor sighed, taking a long time before speaking, "Indeed, I don't need to comfort you. You're far more resilient and strong than I imagined. To you, the comfort of outsiders is nothing but a joke."

The Human Emperor suddenly calmed down and smiled, "Forget it. I was worried you might be angry because of this... But you won't be. Perhaps you've already guessed everything. If you were angry, you might have exploded long ago."

He suddenly realized there was no need to comfort Su Yu. It wasn't necessary. Su Yu was young, but he wasn't an ignorant child. His heart was more resilient than anyone's, and few setbacks could crush him.

At this moment, the Human Emperor was puzzled, "You're only in your twenties and have rarely faced failure..."

Su Yu laughed, "Rarely? No, quite often! I have to thank the Time Sage... She taught me a lesson: failure is nothing, death is nothing. If you endure, you win!"

The Human Emperor's eyes flickered, "Her recipe?"

Thinking of this, he suddenly realized he might have overlooked something, feeling a bit strange, "How old were you when you inherited her recipe?"

"Six years old."

Six years old!

The Human Emperor's expression changed slightly, feeling strange, "The recipe is powerful. Even a trace of its residual power is an irresistible force for you!"

He murmured, "The recipe contains the power of myriad paths. Even if sealed, shattered, and its power consumed... a trace of its power spilling out... It might not affect you physically, but it should leave some mental imprints... Do you often have nightmares?"

He suddenly looked at Su Yu, his eyes flickering, "You can open this sky, open thousands of great paths... I think I understand something!"

He suddenly had a realization!

Su Yu's talent... was different from others. He took a deep breath, "If each time left a bit of will imprint, that would be residual power of the great paths. Each time, it would shatter your mental will, leaving a bit of the power of the great paths... So, you can comprehend the myriad paths, while for many, it's difficult or requires absolute time to comprehend..."

Su Yu opened the sky with the help of others, but if he had no comprehension at all, he wouldn't even be able to start, and how could others help him perfect it?

Thus, Su Yu truly completed the comprehension of the myriad paths!

And this wasn't from thin air, not because his talent was overwhelmingly superior to everyone else's.

It was because, from a young age, Su Yu was constantly washed by the power of the great paths, impacting his spirit. That's why Su Yu could instantly outline characters, not because he was better than others, but because he had already grasped some great paths, just too small and weak to manifest.

Characters are rules!

Rules manifest as characters!

When he met Bai Feng, Su Yu had already grasped many embryonic rules. Later, as he continuously outlined characters, others did it slowly, but only Su Yu did it instantly because others needed a process to understand the rules, while Su Yu didn't. He just needed a system, a comprehension, to condense the power of rules into form!

However, the Human Emperor understood that this process must have been filled with danger, crisis, and pain!

Su Yu was too young and too weak.

At that time, he might not have even been cultivating, yet he was enduring the inheritance and impact of the rules.

Only now did the Human Emperor understand what this young man before him had gone through.

The Human Emperor suddenly asked, "Did you ever despair, think of giving up?"

To end it all!

He asked himself, if he were in that period and encountered such things, what would he choose?

Every day, every night, enduring pain, nightmares, despair... Would he choose to end his life?

Su Yu laughed, "Despair? Yes! At first, I was very desperate. I was terrified. I didn't even want to sleep, never wanted to sleep for a lifetime... At that time, I wished I were a strong person who could stay awake forever. Now, I can actually do that."

Since the age of six, for over a decade, Su Yu seemed never to have had a full night's sleep.

Even in the academy, when he rarely dreamed, because he had experienced almost all the power of the great paths, Su Yu was busy cultivating, sleeping only a little each day.

What does a full night's sleep feel like?

The memory had long blurred.

Su Yu himself didn't know what it felt like to sleep peacefully before the age of six.

Now, he had thought of trying, but there was too much weighing on his mind. The last time he died for a moment, he tried to experience it, but unfortunately, the Culture King and Martial King interrupted him. Even without the interruption, Su Yu wouldn't have had time to experience it.

The Human Emperor silently watched him.

Only now did he seem to understand Su Yu. After a long time, he said softly, "Outsiders say you, Su Yu, have extraordinary talent. But now it seems... maybe just ordinary! The recipe let you experience the power of the great paths on one hand and protected you from collapsing on the other... It's a back-and-forth hammering experience, treating a person as less than human. If a strong person, maybe they could endure, but for a child, it's too cruel!"

The Book of Time constantly hammered Su Yu's will, and after hammering, it repaired, forging steel through repeated tempering.

However, this process was cold, an inhumane form of torment.

Perhaps Su Yu wouldn't be directly hammered to death, but he would collapse.

The Human Emperor continued, "Wenyu probably never imagined that her treasure would end up in your hands, a six-year-old child..."

He chuckled bitterly, "Logically, it shouldn't have been inherited by you."

Su Yu smiled, "Then I should thank Xingyu, your ancestor, shouldn't I?"

At this moment, Su Yu had mentioned this matter once before. The Human Emperor, upon hearing it again, fell silent for a while before speaking, "Perhaps it has harmed you... As for Xing... it might be an ancestor, or perhaps it no longer has any relevance, so there's no need to dwell on it."

Separated by a gate, everything had changed.

The Human Emperor looked at Su Yu once more, "Have you never reached the point of collapse?"

Su Yu looked at him, just looked, and then smiled brilliantly.

The Human Emperor was slightly taken aback...

After a moment, he made a judgment in his heart.

He had!

Not only had he, but... he always had!

The white-haired young man before him had long since collapsed, gone mad, driven to hysteria and despair. Yet, unlike others, he did not show it outwardly. His madness was internal.

"Wenyu..."

The Human Emperor murmured in his heart, perhaps you never expected this?

Wenyu had fulfilled Su Yu!

But she had also harmed Su Yu.

She might not have known that she had created a madman, a hysterical madman.

Calm yet insane!

At this moment, the Human Emperor, much like Zhou Ji that day, realized that Su Yu had been a madman from start to finish.

However, in this era, it seemed only this madman could save them.

The Human Emperor looked deeply at Su Yu, who continued to smile brightly, and after a long while, he said, "Is there a flower on my face? Surely the Human Emperor doesn't have any designs on me?"

The Human Emperor chuckled, and after a while, he whispered, almost inaudibly, "Perhaps you need the Three Gates to open..."

Su Yu looked at him without speaking.

And the Human Emperor had already stepped away to continue discussions with King Yue and the others.

Perhaps Su Yu needed the Three Gates to open.

Because he needed war.

The pressure of war would suppress everything for Su Yu.

Otherwise, the Human Emperor feared that if Su Yu lost the pressure, the compulsion of war, what would he become?

Would he completely collapse?

Or would he gradually recover?

He didn't know!

But he indeed guessed, he saw that Su Yu was already on the brink of collapse. Perhaps, if he just quieted down a bit, Su Yu might collapse, or maybe not, because in his eyes, Su Yu was too resilient!

Just like when Zhao Li first saw Su Yu, he recognized him immediately, believing Su Yu could inherit his legacy. This guy was more tenacious than Zhao Li had imagined.

...

Watching the Human Emperor leave, Su Yu smiled.

Do I need the Three Gates to open?

What a thing to say!

But then again, the opening of the Three Gates, now that's exciting, isn't it?

If they don't open, it really isn't stimulating enough.

Su Yu chuckled to himself and suddenly shouted, "Why are you running? We haven't even discussed the main business yet!"

Over there, the Human Emperor waved his hand, what's the rush?

Let me digest this!

You madman, once I leave, who knows what you'll do. I need to think about it.

...

With the arrival of King Yue and the others, Su Yu's side saw another boost in combat power.

The Human Emperor had a chat with the newcomers, as these included top experts who had stayed behind in the past, as well as those who had covered the retreat, and the spirits of the Culture King's Heaven. He needed to talk to them more.

He also needed to understand the existence of spirits, their feelings and strength after merging with Heaven and Earth.

The Human Emperor's insight was still extremely sharp.

Without Su Yu's introduction, he could actually see the state of the Book Spirit.

...

At this time, Wan Tiansheng approached Su Yu.

Seeing Su Yu alone, looking at the myriad races opposite, he said softly, "Don't take what just happened to heart. Our matters, we solve ourselves. Your teacher's matters, let him solve them himself!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "I don't mind. As for my teacher... after the war ends."

Or perhaps after pacifying the myriad races.

Wan Tiansheng didn't mention it again, looking towards the other side, where powerful auras crisscrossed, he said solemnly, "The myriad races are not easy to deal with, even now, their combat power remains strong."

The previous great war had indeed united the myriad races.

Every time, it was like this with the myriad races.

And Su Yu, after pondering for a while, said, "Principal, your progress has been slow lately. Is it because the severed path has merged into my Heaven and Earth, and your insights have diminished?"

Wan Tiansheng and Lantian had progressed quickly before, but now it had slowed considerably.

Wan Tiansheng, at this point, was only barely at the third tier like the others.

This was still due to his mastery of many great daos, but some daos, Wan Tiansheng hadn't reached the level of mastery, only fusion. Otherwise, just the seven emotions and six desires would be 13 daos, not to mention, the human path he cultivated was not limited to the seven emotions and six desires.

If he mastered them all, he would be at least at the second tier by now.

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment and nodded. Indeed, compared to Su Yu's progress, or compared to others, he was not particularly special at this stage.

It wasn't that Wan Tiansheng had to be special, but as a top genius of this era, he had to be special.

After some thought, Wan Tiansheng said softly, "I master the seven emotions and six desires, joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire... More of a general reference, not fixed! These days, I've reflected a bit, my six desires are not strong!"

"Should I find you a woman?"

Su Yu teased, and Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Nonsense! The so-called six desires are not simply lust, they encompass many things! The desire for life and death, the thirst for knowledge of the future, the hope for strength, the longing for stability..."

He talked a lot, and it had been a long time since he discussed this with Su Yu.

The last time was when they talked about the River of Time.

Wan Tiansheng spoke for a while, then continued, "I've thought about it, perhaps recently, because of your presence, stabilizing everything, I've lost some of the anxiety and unease about the future, lacking a sense of crisis..."

Su Yu laughed, "I just stepped into the first tier, and you've already lost your sense of crisis?"

Wan Tiansheng also laughed, "Not just me, others too! Because... you are undefeated!"

Su Yu laughed, turned his head to look, then looked at Wan Tiansheng, "What do you mean?"

"Fight a tough battle!"

Wan Tiansheng exhaled, "You always want to shoulder everything alone, always worry about someone falling, always want to plan everything, but you must understand, even the Human Emperor, after planning for many years, has failed at times!"

"While it's not yet at the point where defeat means death, and the myriad races' strength is comparable to ours, fight a tough battle!"

Wan Tiansheng said seriously, "Just focus on dealing with your opponent, you worry too much, manage too much, it may not be a good thing."

Su Yu was silent for a while, "Is this everyone's opinion?"

"Yes!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "Fight a tough battle, this time the myriad races are just about equal to us, we vaguely have the upper hand! You can't keep going like this, forcibly elevating everyone, everyone will become increasingly dependent on you, leading to a lack of deep understanding of the great daos, this is not what a qualified commander should do!"

"Su Yu, haven't you noticed, everyone is less inclined to think about things?"

"If this continues... everyone will regress."

Su Yu laughed, "Managing too much, is also not good?"

"Perhaps it is!"

Wan Tiansheng also laughed, "Let go appropriately!"

"So, your idea is, this time when the Human Emperor leaves... we fight a tough battle?"

"No!"

Wan Tiansheng looked at Su Yu, suddenly laughed, "Why wait for the Human Emperor to leave? Why wait for him to sever the path before you fight? Su Yu, that's not your style! While the Human Emperor is still here, while he can suppress his proud soldiers, let's fight now! Get used to working with the Human Emperor! With the Human Emperor overseeing the rear, it's better to deter the myriad races!"

"Then, start the second battle, the third battle... keep fighting until the myriad races dare not raise their heads, at this time, when the Human Emperor leaves, even if he severs the path, the myriad races will worry, is it a trap, is there a problem?"

Wan Tiansheng suddenly laughed, a cunning laugh, "You can even say, the Human Emperor has fallen! Say it every time... after a few times, no one will believe it! Also, those who want to merge with the Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth... why not make use of them?"

"For our own people, you know to blow them up before they sever the path... why, when it comes to the Human Emperor's people, you can't bear to do it, or are you embarrassed to do it?"

Wan Tiansheng licked his lips, smiled, "We must take advantage of the Human Emperor being here, suppress his proud soldiers! In front of the Human Emperor, suppress them! I can see, the Human Emperor supports it! Su Yu, I know, you may not care about these people, nor have the mind to seize power from the Human Emperor... but what about others?"

He laughed, "It's not about seizing power... but... everyone will subconsciously think, should I listen to the Human Emperor, or should I listen to you, Su Yu? The Human Emperor's people, during a great war, will think, the Human Emperor is gone, should I listen to Su Yu? The Human Emperor isn't dead, if I listen to you, and suffer heavy losses, will the Human Emperor weaken?"

Su Yu looked at Old Wan, life has many moments of confusion, sometimes you get through it yourself, sometimes you need someone to point the way.

Wan Tiansheng had actually guided Su Yu many times.

The day he transformed into a demon, he told Su Yu what it meant to help the world when successful, and that time, Su Yu deeply understood.

It was also because of that time, when Su Yu ascended to the position of Human Lord, he forcibly seized power immediately, suppressing those who disagreed, without any hesitation.

Now, Wan Tiansheng was giving him some insights again.

Su Yu's original thought was, when the Human Emperor left, when he severed the path, he would consider the matter of battle, but Wan Tiansheng's opinion was different from his own.

Su Yu fell into contemplation.

After a while, he asked, "You mean, I still need to gather the Human Emperor's people?"

"Of course!"

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "You can discuss matters with the Human Emperor, but when the Human Emperor is not around, you must give everyone the impression... your word is the only one!"

"No, even when he is around, your word must be the only one!"

Wan Tiansheng said in a low voice, "You can go to the Human Emperor to appeal afterward, let the Human Emperor come to you, you can negotiate with the Human Emperor, but you don't need to say too much to them!"

Wan Tiansheng looked at Su Yu and said, "What they need to do is follow orders! As long as the Human Emperor hasn't opposed you... you don't need to pay attention to their words. Your job is to make them obey!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment before smiling, "Isn't that a bit inappropriate?"

"Why would it be?" Wan Tiansheng chuckled. "To you, is there a difference between the Human Emperor and the Great Qin King? Back then, when you became the Human Lord, didn't you suppress those old fossils just the same? Whether they're four hundred years old or forty thousand, they're all relics in your eyes. Why should you care about their age? Don't treat them differently, or the Great Qin King might feel sad. Why should he be treated differently from the Human Emperor?"

Su Yu laughed. That made some sense!

Wan Tiansheng continued, "Right now, it's not a time of peace. The Human Emperor has been severely injured, the Culture King is absent, the Martial King has left, and the Radiant King isn't good at making major decisions. So, this matter can only fall to you!"

Su Yu grinned, "Indeed, who else but me has the capability?"

Wan Tiansheng burst into laughter. This guy was finally back to his old self. He said, "You still hold some reverence for the Human Emperor because you think he might always be right. You don't want to create a rift with him over these matters... But you need to understand, would the Great Qin King hold a grudge against you for punishing some people? The wiser someone is, the more they understand this principle!"

"If the Human Emperor truly thinks you've erred over such matters... then it would only prove that he's not as wise as he should be!"

"Then he wouldn't even be as good as the Great Qin King!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Why do you keep bringing up the Great Qin King? He'd be so sad if he heard this!"

Wan Tiansheng was speechless for a moment, then laughed, "I don't think so. The Great Qin King seems to enjoy it, not showing any signs of sadness. Another thing, on the battlefield, splitting into two factions is actually very unwise! The Myriad Races are a lesson in this. It leads to issues in coordination, cooperation, and support. So, while the Human Emperor is still here, we need to coordinate and cooperate!"

Su Yu rubbed his chin, "In that case, we need to take the initiative..."

He looked across, "My world can extend there now, but if they continue to move upstream, I won't be able to cover it!"

"So what?" Wan Tiansheng said nonchalantly, "Then force them to keep moving upstream. At this moment, going upstream is extremely difficult and consumes a lot of energy. Actually, this is the limit. Otherwise, the Human Emperor and the others wouldn't have needed to go downstream and stay put. Wouldn't that be best?"

Su Yu listened intently. Having an elder by his side to offer advice from time to time was actually quite nice.

Su Yu rarely listened to others' advice, but there were exceptions, like Wan Tiansheng, Zhao Li, Niu Baidao, Zhu Tiandao, and Liu Wenyan. Even if Su Yu didn't agree with their suggestions, he would seriously consider them.

However, currently, only Wan Tiansheng was with Su Yu. Most others had been hidden away by Su Yu.

Because they were too weak!

Naturally, Su Yu had his own selfish motives. Everyone has selfish motives, just to varying degrees. His father, his teacher, some of his friends... he had hidden them all away, not letting anyone know.

He even considered the outcome if he were to be defeated, knowing that dying without a complete body was inevitable.

Wan Tiansheng stopped speaking at this point. The rest, Su Yu understood well enough.

...

Su Yu seriously considered it. Perhaps Old Wan's idea was more suitable than his previous thoughts.

Soon, Su Yu turned and walked toward the Human Emperor.

Seeing him approach, the Human Emperor also stepped forward to have a brief exchange with Su Yu. After hearing Su Yu's thoughts, the Human Emperor pondered for a moment and nodded slightly, indicating his agreement with Su Yu's suggestion.

Su Yu was right. Although the Human Emperor was eager to return and merge with the world, Su Yu's approach might be more beneficial for the future.

...

At this moment, everyone was still chatting and discussing.

Just then, the Human Emperor cleared his throat, immediately halting everyone's actions.

The Human Emperor spoke softly, "Everyone, you know my situation! I'm not fit for intense battles anymore. If I fight another battle, I might completely fall!"

Everyone grew solemn.

The Human Emperor smiled, "I've thought about it... Su Yu, everyone has seen him, seen his strength, his abilities! You all know what he's done in the Myriad Realms. You could say... he's a legend, perhaps a bit less than me... hahaha, but he is indeed legendary!"

Everyone smiled. They liked the Human Emperor's confidence, even though they felt he was boasting again!

The Human Emperor's laughter was hearty, "So I've considered it. From now on, everyone will follow Su Yu's orders, obey military commands, and engage in some battles. On the battlefield, you've followed me for many years, and you all know one thing... military orders are as unyielding as mountains, and orders must be followed!"

Everyone's hearts tightened slightly!

The Human Emperor continued, "Of course, not everyone may agree with Su Yu, but... if you have opinions, you can talk to me after the battle. We'll do some post-battle summaries and improve on any shortcomings... but you absolutely cannot disobey orders on the battlefield!"

The Human Emperor's voice suddenly turned serious, filled with solemnity and gravity, "You're all veterans! Many brothers have followed me from the Human Realm to the Myriad Realms, from the Myriad Realms to the upper reaches of the River of Time! To this day, you should understand! So, even if it's a wrong order... I will stop it in time, or you can tell me after the battle. Don't cause any trouble during the battle and disgrace us!"

At this moment, the Radiant King pondered and softly said, "Your Majesty, what if the Human Lord Su orders us to our deaths?"

He chuckled, "For example, if the Human Lord Su says, 'All of you go self-destruct, blow the Myriad Races sky-high, and let others reap the rewards... should we agree to that too?"

The Human Emperor replied calmly, "Su Yu shouldn't give such brainless orders..."

Not far away, Su Yu, with his arms crossed, suddenly interjected, "That's not necessarily true!"

The Human Emperor was speechless. Are you contradicting me?

I'm in the process of authorizing you!

Su Yu said indifferently, "On the battlefield, anything is possible. In the heat of battle, self-destruction might be the only way to win. If I order you to self-destruct, are you going to disobey?"

Su Yu said coldly, "Sacrificing the self for the greater good, isn't that what many people pursue? As long as the war is won, can't everything be explained?"

Everyone instinctively glanced at the Great Zhou King not far away. Those familiar with Su Yu understood that he was targeting the Great Zhou King again.

The Radiant King chuckled, "True... but... we're just afraid that the Human Lord Su trusts his inner circle more. When it's time to reap the rewards, it's the inner circle, and when it's time to sacrifice, it's us. We wouldn't be happy with that!"

"Not fearing poverty but fearing inequality... that's not just empty talk!"

The Radiant King looked at Su Yu, wondering how he would address this.

Su Yu thought for a moment and casually gave an example, saying playfully, "Back when I went to the Upper Realm, I led a group of Daofuse cultivators, including Prefect Wan, the Great Zhou King, Marquis Dingjun, Shadow Marquis, Yunshui Marquis, Marquis Nanxi, Heavendoom... a large group!"

"I'm not sure if Xuelan and the others have told you... that day, I ordered everyone to self-destruct!"

Some people's hearts tightened immediately.

Su Yu said calmly, "Those who followed orders that day survived, not one fell! Those who didn't follow orders, who didn't self-destruct, Shadow, Yunshui, Wushan, and Jiang Hai all died! As for Nanxi, I simply let it go, not bothering to pursue it! Xuelan didn't follow orders either, but she was blown up by the enemy, her body shattered. If not for the life-saving seal left by the Snow King, she would have perished long ago!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "If you can't accept this example, then no matter how much I say, it's useless! If you listen to me, I will naturally do my utmost to keep you alive... If you don't listen, what does it matter to me if such people die?"

The Radiant King pondered for a while and then asked, "What if we have some disagreements with the Human Lord Su?"

"Hold it in!"

Su Yu said coldly, "After the battle, go cry to the Human Emperor. The Human Emperor will naturally come to me! I will naturally give the Human Emperor an explanation! As for you... you have no right to bargain with me. Of course, if you think I'm too domineering, you can choose not to participate and stay in the rear with the Human Emperor! Let me be clear... if you think I, Su Yu, am not qualified to lead you, then you can withdraw. I don't mind having fewer people. If none of you are willing, I'll take my people and still be able to resist the Myriad Races!"

Some felt insulted, and Zhan Wang grumbled, "Human Lord Su, your words are inappropriate. Since we've been fighting here for countless years, we're not afraid of death. If we were truly afraid, we would have fled long ago!"

Su Yu laughed, "I didn't say you were afraid of death. You seniors have fought on the front lines for many years. I don't deny your contributions... but..."

Su Yu paused, then said solemnly, "But we're not freeloaders either! Ask the people present how many battles we've fought over the years? Since we're all heroes... there's no need for more praise! When it comes to killing... you probably haven't killed as many as we have. We've fought from the Human Realm to the Myriad Realms, to the Upper Realm, to the Death Realm, and now we've reached the upper reaches... Who's afraid of death? If you're afraid of death, there's no need to follow me here!"

In terms of merit, everyone present had great achievements, and Su Yu couldn't be bothered to say more.

Praising their achievements, their merits might not even surpass those of the Great Qin King and others.

Not far away, the Human Emperor glanced at Su Yu and smiled, "Human Lord Su, I have no other requirements for you, just one, or perhaps it's my bottom line... Dying in battle is acceptable, but not dying unjustly! If someone can be saved and isn't, if your inner circle's death can solve a problem but you let my old brothers die three or five times over... then your selfishness is too much!"

The Human Emperor spoke again, "I can understand some reasonable bias. For instance, if you have to choose between saving two people, one being the Hundred Battle King and the other being Wan Tiansheng, and you choose to save Wan Tiansheng... people might resent you, but we wouldn't oppose you. However, if you can save both and you still choose only Wan Tiansheng, ignoring the Hundred Battle King... then you're not fit to be the leader!"

His smile faded, replaced by a stern expression, and he spoke bluntly. Some bias was inevitable. But Su Yu couldn't take it too far, or else he wouldn't be fit to lead, and the Human Emperor wouldn't entrust his people to him to die.

Su Yu chuckled, "Just oversee the battle!"

The Human Emperor nodded, "I'll be watching!"

Su Yu didn't say more. He turned to the group of people with the Hundred Battle King and said calmly, "You've heard the Human Emperor's words. If anyone has any objections, speak now. After this moment, my word is law, and no questioning will be tolerated!"

In the crowd, the Eye King, who had previously revealed three eyes, hesitated before speaking, "Su Lord, should we follow orders only during wartime, or also after?"

"During wartime. After the war, you're free to do as you please!" Su Yu replied nonchalantly. "The Luminous Domain Mansion isn't interested in recruiting new members. Isn't the Human Emperor still alive? For now, I'm borrowing troops. During this period, just follow my orders. Of course, after the war, you might be reluctant to leave me, begging tearfully to join the Luminous Domain Mansion... we'll talk about it then!"

The atmosphere shifted, becoming somewhat awkward. The group felt a bit uncomfortable. What a thing to say! Who would beg tearfully to join you? That would be quite disrespectful to the Human Emperor.

Even the Human Emperor was at a loss for words. Goodness, are you not taking me seriously at all?

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "You never know. Don't think it's impossible now, only to slap yourself in the face later!"

The crowd laughed awkwardly, choosing not to respond. Whatever makes you happy! We're too lazy to argue with you.

Suddenly, Su Yu's demeanor changed, becoming solemn. "From this moment on, it's wartime. Everyone, follow orders!"

The crowd tensed up.

Su Yu commanded, "Change your address, call me Emperor Yu!"

"......"

The Hundred Battle King and his group were stunned. Wan Tiansheng laughed, and the group quickly bowed, shouting in unison, "Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

"......"

The Hundred Battle King and his group exchanged glances. After a moment, the Radiant King laughed, "Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

In the next moment, dozens of rulers of laws, whether reluctantly or begrudgingly, all spoke up, "Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu laughed heartily and shouted again, "Request the Human Emperor to step back, leave the battlefield!"

The crowd exchanged looks and had no choice but to follow suit, "Request the Human Emperor to step back, leave the battlefield!"

"......"

The Human Emperor was speechless but still smiled, retreating from the battlefield area designated by Su Yu, standing alone at the rear with a smile.

At this moment, the Human Emperor didn't know whether to feel gratified or troubled. Su Yu was indeed interesting. Moreover, he believed that as long as Su Yu wasn't overly selfish, his old comrades wouldn't face any issues. After a few drills, they could launch a large-scale operation.

Just as he felt gratified, Su Yu suddenly shouted, "Follow my command, charge, kill!"

With those words, he charged towards the direction of the Myriad Races!

Wan Tiansheng and the others didn't hesitate, rushing out. The Hundred Battle King and his group were stunned, completely taken aback!

Damn!

The Radiant King and the others were also dumbfounded, hesitating for a moment before going a bit crazy. You... you just charged like that?

The group hesitated for a moment but then gritted their teeth and followed.

On the opposite side, a surge of powerful auras rose as numerous strong figures floated in the air.

Su Yu suddenly halted, "Stop, fall back, you bunch of fools, why hesitate?"

Su Yu was furious! Under the stunned gazes of the Myriad Races, he quickly led his people back.

In less than five minutes, Su Yu shouted again, "Charge!"

Boom!

The group quickly followed the charge!

"Retreat!"

Su Yu led them back again!

This time, the Myriad Races were bewildered, and the Radiant King and the others were also confused because Su Yu was furious, constantly reprimanding those who were slow, making the veteran experts blush with embarrassment. I... I just didn't expect you to charge when you said charge, and retreat when you said retreat.

They couldn't react in time! They were truly bewildered by Su Yu!

Su Yu kept repeating this scene. Gradually, on the opposite side, the strong figures of the Myriad Races became serious, not relaxing their vigilance but becoming extremely solemn.

They vaguely realized... Su Yu seemed to be drilling his troops. At least, at this moment, he achieved absolute obedience to orders.

The Human Emperor's people, under Su Yu's command, no longer hesitated. When he said charge, they charged!
