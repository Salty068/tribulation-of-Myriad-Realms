Chapter 748: Su Yu's Plan

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng emerged from their hidden location, leaving May and the others to secure a position first. They were deep within Chaos Mountain, where the chaotic aura was even more intense. Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, observing the power of chaos. It was evident that this place was closer to the era of creation, with very little source qi and an abundance of chaotic energy.

"Sever the power of the Great Dao!" Su Yu instructed. Both he and Wan Tiansheng cut off their connection to the Great Dao, knowing that if they didn't, they would be easily detected by their enemies.

Wan Tiansheng's expression was grave as he communicated telepathically, "Are we really going to make a move? Our goal in coming to the Upper Realm was to incite conflict between the Myriad Races and Chaos Mountain, not to act as the vanguard ourselves."

"Principal... tell me, if you knew there was a third party involved, would you fight to the death with your enemy?" Su Yu replied, his eyes narrowing.

Wan Tiansheng sighed inwardly. Indeed, to make the Myriad Races and Chaos Mountain fight to the death, they first needed to understand the strength on Su Yu's side.

Su Yu continued, "Principal, I'm actually ready... to let Tiangu and the others ascend to the Upper Realm!"

"Hmm?"

Su Yu explained, "Tiangu and the others know us. Our current mystery might not be a good thing. But if Tiangu understands... do you think they perceive us as truly strong?"

Wan Tiansheng's heart stirred. "You mean... to make the real seem fake, and the fake seem real... to confuse the Myriad Races?"

Su Yu nodded. "Not just the Myriad Races, but also to let Chaos Mountain know that we're not as strong as we appear! It's just a facade of strength!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Right now, we're very mysterious, so both Chaos Mountain and the Myriad Races are wary of us. But we can hide some of our strength, like Qirong, you, the Great Qin King, and the Great Xia King..."

Some people were hard to hide, like Lantian and the Great Zhou King, and Tiangu knew about Fat Ball's existence. However, some could still be concealed.

Wan Tiansheng pondered, "So you want to attack the Lower Realm?"

"Not in a hurry!" Su Yu smiled. "We need to wait! We need to gather more than 50 council tokens first! With over 50 tokens, we can influence some power of laws, temporarily open the passage to the Lower Realm, trap and kill some people, and then seal it again! But not now!"

Su Yu had his plans. Being mysterious was good, as it kept the enemy guessing. But if you appeared too strong, both sides would be cautious. In such a situation, no fool would fight to the death.

Taking a deep breath, Su Yu communicated, "Principal, even among our own people, we need to be cautious! I have a way to make you fake your death and hide in the shadows! Now, with more people on our side, things are getting complicated... I haven't reached that level yet, and over time, people's thoughts can change, leading to unexpected events!"

Previously, he needed to appear strong. Now, Su Yu wanted to appear weak because he had revealed too many of his cards! Even Qirong needed to be hidden. Currently, aside from Lantian and Marquis Giant Bamboo, no one knew there was a Heaven King on Su Yu's side.

Su Yu felt a vague unease. The more he exposed himself, the more actions he took, the less of a secret he would be in the Upper Realm. Everyone would know he was dangerous, and killing him might cause the Human Race to scatter.

"The Space and Iron Devourer Races still need to be... carefully considered."

"I know!" Wan Tiansheng said no more, giving Su Yu a thoughtful look. Suddenly, he asked, "You have other plans, don't you?"

"Yes." Su Yu nodded, and Wan Tiansheng didn't press further.

However, Su Yu took the initiative to communicate, "I want to find time to return to the Lower Realm and find a way to resurrect some people! The South King and others are currently undead. If they can be resurrected... they would truly be Heaven Kings! Resurrecting the undead, I believe, would enhance their strength, as their power is currently suppressed!"

Wan Tiansheng inhaled sharply! Su Yu wanted to resurrect these undead? Could it be done?

"Resurrection boils down to a few points: the path of life, sealing the turbulence of the Great Dao, stripping away the Great Dao... Qirong should be skilled at stripping the Great Dao. If Liu Hong's strength improves, he might be able to block the erosion of the Undead Great Dao, then transition from death to life!"

"I'll study the path of life more in the future!"

"Back then, the Culture King wanted to resurrect Xingyue, needing the four paths of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone. But the Culture King didn't master the path of paper. I vaguely understand how to use the path of paper now, capturing true spirits, like Lantian, to create a living body for the undead..."

Su Yu spoke at length, and Wan Tiansheng listened silently. He knew Su Yu was trying to gain more leverage. Although young, Su Yu was not lacking in methods. With more and more elders under his command, Su Yu was also worried about potential issues.

Su Yu was candid, continuing to communicate, "I'm worried these old guys have ulterior motives. The truly reliable ones are the humans from this tide! They've almost severed ties with the ancient humans! So, I'll find time and opportunities to let the Great Han King and others step into the Daofuse Realm... Principal, and... if there's danger, let the old guys go!"

Wan Tiansheng's pupils contracted. Su Yu didn't look at him, instead surveying the surroundings with an unchanged expression, communicating, "These people owe me! In war, should they hide away? If there's danger, they go! If they die, I won't feel bad. But if you and the others die, I will!"

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, quickly communicating, "Alright, I understand!"

"Just remember, if it all goes wrong, and they die, we'll start over. I'll find a way to carve out a living space in the Death Realm! If necessary, we'll retreat to the Death Realm!"

Wan Tiansheng was secretly shocked, "Are you... very desperate?"

Su Yu was incredibly calm, "Not desperate, just lacking some hope! I'm certain the Chaos Race has beings at the level of the rulers of laws. The matter of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, these guys might know. If they do, and they kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis... the Myriad Races might gain many rulers of laws! Not just the Myriad Races, the Chaos Race won't be lacking either. There are likely many Heaven King-level beings, all with the potential to become rulers of laws!"

"Ten thousand years of accumulation, do we expect to level it in just a few years?"

Su Yu saw little hope because the Upper Realm was far stronger than he had imagined. The old relics' intentions were hard to predict. Even if they became rulers of laws, they might not follow Su Yu's wishes. They've lived so long; a few threats wouldn't make them bow.

The truly trustworthy ones were those who supported Su Yu not because of his strength, like Hongmeng and others who supported him from the start.

This time, Su Yu had another goal: to let all the guardians step into the Daofuse Realm first. Fight a battle, let the Myriad Races discover the strength of the Chaos Race, or simply let some people escape on purpose.

This time, Su Yu brought four Daofuse Realm experts: Heavenly Dragon Marquis, Phoenix Emperor, Ape Emperor, and Kunpeng. Among them, perhaps they could be used.

Thoughts swirled in Su Yu's mind. These might be more suitable than Tiangu and the others. After all, they were from the Myriad Races, and Heavenly Dragon Marquis had always been in the Upper Realm, perhaps he could be used, provided the Iron Devourer Race and Space Ancient Beast Race were willing to retreat with Su Yu. Otherwise, these races would be exposed.

Let's see their choice!

Beside him, Wan Tiansheng didn't know why Su Yu, who was confident before, suddenly seemed a bit dejected. He couldn't help but glance at Su Yu a few more times, communicating, "Why the sudden dejection?"

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then communicated, "Because of Hundred Battle!"

"..."

Wan Tiansheng was genuinely stunned this time, communicating, "What do you mean?"

"Hundred Battle... Principal, do you really think he's a reckless brute, to the point of madness?"

Wan Tiansheng frowned, "Are you saying... there's something wrong with Hundred Battle?"

It couldn't be!

Su Yu communicated, "Hundred Battle is the strongest human closest to the Human King in countless ages! Not only did Moon Luo trap Hundred Battle, but also the entire human race's old relics... And the third tide, Yue Gang, Qirong, these people aren't weak, right? Yet they were played by the old relics, even forcing Yue Gang to personally execute Qirong! Yue Gang couldn't even avenge her in the end!"

"The Ancient Giant Race, what's their situation? Why did Hundred Battle have descendants in the Ancient Giant Race, and what are Thunderstorm and the others thinking? Marquis Yunshui and the others were easily subdued by me... Don't you think these old relics are too obedient?"

Wan Tiansheng communicated, "Obedience is also because we're strong and have many methods. Hundred Battle did get many people killed."

"I know." Su Yu nodded, "But I'm not at ease. I think, Hundred Battle chasing Moon Luo and disappearing without a trace might not be a good thing! Principal, even a reckless brute knows one thing: Chaos Mountain is enemy territory, extremely dangerous! If he can't catch Moon Luo, what would you or I do?"

"Kill others, cause chaos, or simply find human experts and gather subordinates..."

Wan Tiansheng said, pausing slightly, looking at Su Yu.

Su Yu nodded, "Did he do that? He did nothing! He didn't even care if there were humans left in the Upper Realm! He recklessly chased Moon Luo into the depths of Chaos Mountain, so recklessly that everyone thinks Hundred Battle is not worth considering! Even if he's unsealed, the Myriad Races aren't too concerned because the impression Hundred Battle gives... is that of a reckless brute, a fool blinded by lust!"

Su Yu continued, "This makes me suspicious!"

"Suspicious of what?"

Wan Tiansheng's eyes were peculiar. Su Yu licked his lips, "Suspicious that Hundred Battle knows about the existence of the Chaos lineage! He knows how strong they are, that he can't match them, even if he defeats the Myriad Races, he can't defeat the Chaos Race! So, at his peak, Hundred Battle chose to give up... chose to be sealed, chose for many human relics to die, chose to endure!"

Wan Tiansheng felt a chill in his heart!

Su Yu felt a chill run down his spine. "Are you suggesting that Hundred Battle... and Moon Luo are in cahoots? That Moon Luo might be his ally?"

At that moment, Wan Tiansheng felt a coldness seep into his heart. "Why would you think that?"

"When did Su Yu start having such thoughts?" Su Yu sighed and transmitted his thoughts, "I started suspecting when I saw Qi Rong. The ancient figures from the Upper Realm she mentioned, none of them are fools! Hundred Battle favored Moon Luo, even kept her by his side, and none of those ancient figures knew? Yet no one stopped it!"

"Moreover, Marquis Zhennan self-destructed for Hundred Battle. Such decisiveness... can a mere brute win people's hearts like that?"

"The Great Zhou King said that Hundred Battle was sincere and emotional, with talents beyond imagination!"

"Ancient figures launched suicidal attacks on the myriad races to pave the way for him, and they did it for a brute? Were Yue Gang and the others really that weak? Why didn't anyone pave the way for Yue Gang? During the third tide, the Human Race struggled much more. By the ninth tide, the Human Race was incredibly strong. At their peak, they launched suicidal attacks to pave the way for Hundred Battle. What were they thinking? Were they tired of living? Unless... this Human Lord was extremely charismatic!"

"Even after six thousand years, people like Marquis Dingjun still miss Hundred Battle..."

Su Yu took a deep breath. "Until today, just now, when Jiang Hai said he was under the command of the Battle King, I started pondering a question..."

"What question?"

Su Yu chuckled, "If I badmouth King Gong in front of Hetu, how would Hetu react?"

"He'd be angry, furious, and would probably fight you!"

"And if I badmouth the Martial King in front of Marquis Lanshan?"

"Awkward, annoyed, unhappy..."

"And if I badmouth King Yue in front of Marquis Huoyun?"

"You saw it before; you had to stop him from fighting you..."

Wan Tiansheng's eyes flickered. "You mean Jiang Hai's reaction was too calm?"

Su Yu nodded. "Yes, we talked about Hundred Battle, even mocked him, ridiculed him... and Jiang Hai, a marquis under the Battle King, didn't react at all, as if we were talking about a stranger! How do you think Hongmeng would react if we said King Gong's descendants were all useless in front of him?"

"Unhappy!"

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "He definitely wouldn't be happy. Hongmeng might even abandon his alliance with you for Hetu. You and I both knew this beforehand!"

Su Yu nodded.

"Either Jiang Hai is cold-hearted, or... this person who has been dormant for many years might know about Hundred Battle!"

Su Yu said quietly, "He might know who Hundred Battle is, might even know everything that happened, but pretends not to!"

Su Yu's voice turned cold. "But, how could he know about Hundred Battle after being dormant for so long? He knew about Hundred Battle's defeat, as Moon Heavenly Venerable said. Then he should have asked what kind of person Hundred Battle was, why he was defeated, and even defended him a bit... The Great Zhou King defended him, but Jiang Hai didn't even mention it. I even pointed out that he was under the Battle King, and he still said nothing."

Wan Tiansheng hesitated. "Maybe he was dormant for too long, and besides, he wasn't familiar with Hundred Battle, just a descendant of the Battle King, so he didn't care much..."

"It's different! Principal, let me ask you, if many years later, I have descendants, and one day, my descendants are ridiculed without restraint in front of you, even if you've never met them, would you defend them, even punish those who badmouth them?"

Wan Tiansheng was silent for a moment, then nodded. "Yes, I'd defend them. Family comes first, not reason. You can discipline your own children, but if outsiders criticize them, it won't sit well!"

Su Yu laughed. "Principal, you've changed! You used to prioritize reason over family. Don't say this outside, or those Eternal descendants you killed back then would have died in vain."

Wan Tiansheng shook his head. "It's different. Mistakes can be punished, but you can't just ignore them. When it's time to protect, you must protect. You can't just pass judgment without asking. That's punishing without teaching!"

At this point, Wan Tiansheng took a deep breath. "Jiang Hai's reaction is indeed odd. I didn't pay attention before, but now that you mention it, I have some thoughts! That day, we both saw it. Marquis Huoyun wept bitterly when he saw King Yue's corpse, in great pain... That wasn't an act! Look at Marquis Nanxi's reaction when the Great Ming King revealed his identity, and you'll understand his feelings towards the descendants of the Radiant King!"

He felt heavy at this moment.

He hadn't thought about these things.

But according to Su Yu's speculation, including some deductions, the disastrous defeat of Hundred Battle in the previous tide might have issues.

It might align with Su Yu's previous thoughts.

A disastrous defeat, a weakening of strength!

In this way, the Chaos lineage would be exposed. Without a third party, the Chaos lineage and the myriad races would inevitably fight to the death. If not for Su Yu's appearance, a great war might have erupted when the lower realm opened!

And at this time, without any so-called third-party interference, if Hundred Battle was really in league with Moon Luo... even some ancient figures were his allies, then soon, Hundred Battle could quickly gather a powerful force!

Is that so?

Wan Tiansheng wasn't sure!

Su Yu wasn't sure either.

Because in their minds, the Hundred Battle King was just a brute, a complete brute.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng suddenly thought of someone and said softly, "If you say it enough, lies become truth! Su Yu, do you remember Zhu Tianfang's matter?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and he nodded.

"When everyone said that the Great Ming King's eldest son had long died, they would casually joke that Zhu Tiandao was no match for Zhu Tianfang. Over time, everyone believed it. Who would question it? Before Zhu Tianfang appeared, everyone said he was dead, but... he lived in everyone's words, yet he wasn't dead!"

"Rumors can be as powerful as gold!" Wan Tiansheng said softly, "When everyone says Hundred Battle is a brute, blinded by lust, we naturally think that Hundred Battle... is a waste! The only one who truly defended Hundred Battle was the Great Zhou King! Only the Great Zhou King said several times that Hundred Battle wasn't a waste, just unlucky in the last battle. Defending him might not be out of malice! After all, Hundred Battle was once a Human Lord!"

He was the Human Lord chosen by the ancient figures themselves!

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng thought of many things. "Constantly humiliating Hundred Battle is actually humiliating those ancient figures who chose him as the Human Lord! Would they humiliate themselves?"

He exhaled. "I didn't pay attention before because I was led astray by everyone's words. Now that I think about it, those who humiliate Hundred Battle... seem to be the same ones who once praised him! Does this negate everything they did in the ninth tide?"

Su Yu remained silent.

Wan Tiansheng felt a bit bitter. "These myriad races, the Human Race is treacherous, this isn't an empty statement! Su Yu, we... might just be someone else's pawns, unexpectedly emerging pawns!"

Su Yu's expression remained unchanged, nodding, "Perhaps! But I'm not sure yet. To confirm all this... it's actually simple!"

Su Yu licked his lips. "I'll have the Iron Devourer Race do something, spread the news throughout the Upper Realm, calling for Hundred Battle to return and assist in attacking the Chaos lineage, even have Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others promise that if Hundred Battle truly wants revenge... he will definitely appear! If he still doesn't show up and continues to fight with Moon Luo... it means Hundred Battle doesn't want to get involved in this mess! His struggle with Moon Luo is just a joke..."

Su Yu sneered coldly. "He's very bold, and has plenty of courage! If everything is calculated... he's certain the myriad races won't kill him, or can't kill him, or perhaps, his seal might be fake! Moon Luo's seal might be something that can be lifted at any time! Hundred Battle is certain he won't die, and even... deliberately sealed the path of the flesh, preventing the Human Race from advancing. On one hand, it keeps the Human Race weak and unnoticed. On the other hand, once he appears, unseals the path, and helps others enter Daofuse, Principal, do you think people should thank him or hate him?"

Wan Tiansheng considered for a moment. "A savior appears, making everyone stronger, even if there was a mishap in the last tide, that's the last tide's business, unrelated to this tide. We have no feelings for the ancient times..."

"Exactly!"

Su Yu laughed, "Everything is still uncertain for now! One Jiang Hai might not mean much, but pay more attention! Hundred Battle led over a hundred Daofuse cultivators back then, and they all felt hopeless against the Chaos lineage, choosing to take desperate measures... That Chaos lineage might be stronger than imagined!"

This speculation... is just speculation.

If true, Hundred Battle is a terrifying figure, a hero!

He didn't want to fight the myriad races to the death, giving the Chaos lineage an advantage. He'd rather let the myriad races think they've won, greatly strengthening themselves, giving them a period of development, developing many strong individuals, enough to contend with the Chaos lineage... letting these two lineages think there's no third party, and they can fight to the death, and finally, Hundred Battle would come to clean up the mess!

And Su Yu's appearance, on the contrary, disrupted some of his plans.

Otherwise, even if Hundred Battle truly won against the myriad races back then, it would have been a costly victory, and thus, he would definitely be no match for the Chaos lineage.

And if he lost, fought the myriad races to the death, both sides suffering heavy losses, it would seem to benefit the Chaos lineage. Instead, he was directly sealed, the Human Race suffered a great defeat, and now, the myriad races retained enough strength to deter the Chaos lineage, preventing them from acting rashly.

Su Yu thought carefully, and perhaps at that time, this method was the best.

At that time, even if Hundred Battle spoke of this lineage, no one would believe it, because the other side left no trace. The Chaos lineage is now easily believed to exist, related to Moon Luo sealing Hundred Battle, making people think this lineage is not weak!

Even Hundred Battle fell into her hands!

Over the years, the myriad races have had their suspicions. The sudden appearance of Moon Luo six thousand years ago led them to believe that there were still powerful beings hidden in the shadows.

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng fell silent, lost in their thoughts. The entire situation had stemmed from Jiang Hai's negligence, possibly due to a prolonged slumber that caused him to overlook certain matters. If Jiang Hai had reacted strongly, Su Yu might not have thought so deeply about it now. Of course, Qi Rong's appearance played a part too, revealing to Su Yu just how strong the influence of the ancient figures over the Human Realm was. The Human Lord was merely a puppet, and Yue Gang had been forced to kill his own Dao companion!

But now, with Su Yu, it seemed the influence of those ancient figures had completely vanished. They could kill and seize as they pleased!

"It's getting more interesting!" Su Yu suddenly chuckled as they walked. "Principal, I'm starting to look forward to it!"

"Look forward to what?"

"Look forward to Hundred Battle being exactly as I imagine. Only then would he be worthy of the title of the ninth generation Human Lord, worthy of being a peerless genius! For ten thousand years, he was hailed as the most talented and strongest warrior! Otherwise, before this, in my eyes, Hundred Battle was just a clown!"

Su Yu laughed, "Everyone says the Ninth Tide is the final confrontation! The Human Lord of the Ninth Tide is the strongest Human Lord! The Ninth Tide is the peak of the Human Realm and the myriad races! Yet, that peak battle wasn't all that impressive!"

Nine is the ultimate number! The Ninth Tide held special significance, birthing a peerless genius like Hundred Battle. Yet, it ended rather anticlimactically. Hundred Battle was swiftly defeated, leaving everyone puzzled. Later, it was discovered that he lost to Moon Luo, making everyone think, "Hundred Battle... what a waste!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "It wasn't very impressive. Nine is the ultimate... Hundred Battle must have had something extraordinary! Looking back now, it's easy to see some things. The Ancient Giant Race, knowing our strength, chose to seal their realm! Su Yu, you're a remarkable person. Has any race offered to marry their female warriors to you? Did the Ancient Giant Race offer their princess to you? Did the Iron Devourer Race's Full Moon give you a second glance?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Principal, I'm not interested in marrying outside my race."

"Whether you're interested or not is one thing, but has anyone offered?"

Wan Tiansheng sighed, "Yet, Hundred Battle has descendants! Even six thousand years after his defeat, the Ancient Giant Race still protects his descendants and hasn't even glanced at you, Su Yu... What kind of person can make a race with a Heavenly Sovereign so devoted?"

He laughed, "The Iron Devourer Race doesn't even treat you that way! Believe it or not, if you were defeated, the Iron Devourer Race would quickly wash their hands of you. If you and the Iron Devourer Race had descendants, they'd either hide them completely or hand them over to avoid the risk of annihilation!"

Su Yu smiled wryly, "That's quite possible!"

"Exactly, so... maybe your thoughts are correct. Perhaps we've been blinded by victory, failing to consider so many things."

Wan Tiansheng sighed again, "Continuous victories, coupled with some people's constant hints, made us believe that we are the saviors of the Human Realm. But the reality might not be so!"

The two exchanged a glance, both feeling a deep resonance. In this vast Myriad Realms, it's hard to say who is whose pawn. You might think everything is under control, but the truth... might not be so!

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng also agreed with Su Yu's opinion, saying, "Let's investigate first. If there's a chance, suffer a crushing defeat... let a few strong ones die, and see how everyone reacts! No one can win forever! If you have the Great Zhou King fake it... then make it real. Perhaps both Lantian and I can die in battle!"

He looked at Su Yu, smiling lightly, "You can't guarantee you'll never lose in your life. Before it reaches a life-and-death situation, lose once and see. After a defeat, everyone will be calmer and see things more clearly. Then, we'll know who is truly with us and who isn't!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "Even if I lose, whether real or fake, it must be at the peak! Let's first see how many strong ones are there. Even if we lose... we must take some down with us!"

The two exchanged a glance and laughed again. Whether their speculations were right or not, testing it wouldn't cost them much. As for those who choose to leave, flee, or give up after a defeat... they were never truly committed, so there's no need to care.

...

Soon, the two arrived near the mountain Wan Tiansheng had discovered earlier. Su Yu's eyes glowed with divine light, sweeping over the area quickly before closing his eyes.

Su Yu's heart trembled slightly as he transmitted, "There are people, but I didn't dare to look too closely. There's a Heavenly Sovereign present, and the pillar of the Great Dao is very strong!"

He didn't dare to look too closely, even though his strength had grown significantly. There were indeed people, and many of them.

...

At the same time, in the distant mountain. Yue Hao frowned slightly, and suddenly, two doors appeared in his eyes, dark and ominous, unlike the Heaven Gate, resembling the Gate of Hell. He looked out, scanning the surroundings.

...

At this moment, Su Yu felt a chill in his heart. A probing technique! This time, he truly encountered an opponent. His Starry Sky Seal slightly fluctuated, suppressing all ripples of source qi, fortune, and the Great Dao, making him and Wan Tiansheng as still as stones, silently lying in wait.

He had only glanced casually, yet the other party seemed to have sensed it. Such an existence was terrifying! Definitely a Heavenly Sovereign! And possibly stronger than Moon Heavenly Sovereign and the others.

They lay in wait for a long time until the probing force disappeared. Su Yu remained unmoving, continuing to lie in wait. After a while, the probing force swept through again. This time, it quickly retreated.

Once the probing force disappeared, Su Yu quickly took Wan Tiansheng and left the area, no longer lying in wait. Not long after, someone else emerged, searching the mountain, feeling quite speechless, thinking Yue Hao might be making a fuss over nothing. Always feeling unsafe! Was it because he left the Sacred Clan and the ancestors, so he lacked a sense of security?

...

Having retreated far away, Su Yu did not continue observing the area. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Su Yu transmitted, "This is a major base, with many strong ones! Attacking here might not be wise... but for a crushing defeat, this place is quite suitable!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment, then added, "There's definitely a Heavenly Sovereign, possibly more than one... we've encountered a tough opponent!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Isn't that perfect? If they're too weak, how can we showcase our strength? If we're too weak and easily defeated, no one would believe it, right?"

Su Yu nodded, "Indeed!"

He laughed, quickly saying, "The specifics are unclear, but there's at least one Heavenly Sovereign. As for Heavenly Kings, judging by the last surprise attack on the Nether Race, there are no fewer than four!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment, then said, "In the Upper Realm, there's no phenomenon upon falling, the Great Dao collapses, and the rules riot, which is the only sign! That's actually easy to handle. I still have some pseudo-daos... give me some time, and I can create some commotion. The fear is... if they truly die!"

Su Yu said heavily, "The opponent is too strong, I'm afraid we might truly be finished!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, comforting him, "Just think of it as before. Which battle wasn't a risk? Death is unpredictable! Since you still have some pseudo-daos, even if you're gravely injured, you have hope of recovering quickly, right?"

"As long as there's a sliver of life... there's hope!"

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "Since you have doubts, then go ahead! Even if you truly lose, we'll still support you... as for others, it doesn't matter! If Hundred Battle truly has the ability, the Human Realm won't be in trouble!"

"Even if some among us are with Hundred Battle, then let them have the Lower Realm, let the myriad races and the Chaos lineage have the Upper Realm, and we... will occupy the Death Realm!"

Wan Tiansheng continued, "Give it a try! As long as we roughly understand the situation, find a good retreat, and can withdraw at any time, even if we lose, we can preserve our living forces!"

Su Yu thought for a moment, nodding slightly, "Alright, but... we need more assurance. At least those guys from the myriad races should be able to come to our aid at critical moments, or deal with this lineage!"

Saying this, Su Yu grinned, "Since we're almost exposed, and that guy always feels someone is watching him... actually... let's expose ourselves!"

With that, he suddenly opened his Heaven Gate completely! In an instant, he looked towards the distant mountain. At this sight, Su Yu gasped, "Retreat!"

In an instant, he pulled Wan Tiansheng, tearing through the void, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

In that instant, a figure appeared, none other than Yue Hao. Yue Hao's long hair fluttered as he frowned slightly, looking around, reaching out to grab, causing slight spatial fluctuations to appear. Yue Hao, with a cold face, looked around again, muttering, "Heaven Gate? Or something else?"

Someone was watching them! Not just once, but three times—once before, just now, and once even earlier. As for the reports of returning people saying it was ancient beasts in heat, that was nonsense. Even a beast in heat wouldn't give him that kind of feeling of being watched.

Yue Hao murmured softly, "Torchbearers?"

They were quite bold, and their methods were not bad, having infiltrated Chaos Mountain. They escaped! "Watching us... are they planning something against us?"

Yue Hao laughed. Thinking too simply, even if the Torchbearers had a Heavenly Sovereign, their strength was greatly diminished. The people of Bingku were all dead, and it was impossible for them to have hidden so many strong ones unless they had been hiding in Chaos Mountain all along, which was impossible.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was fleeing frantically, escaping seven or eight thousand miles in the blink of an eye, instantly hiding with Wan Tiansheng.

Year 766 of the New Yu Calendar.

In a secluded corner, Su Yu's voice trembled slightly, "Two Heavenly Sovereigns, six Heavenly Kings! A total of eight supreme experts! And this is just one base, not even their main lair. There are over thirty Daofuse Realm cultivators!"

Su Yu's heart was shaken as he grasped the magnitude of their strength. Wan Tiansheng, standing beside him, inhaled sharply, "So many? This is just a forward base, right? At most, they've brought half or even a third of their forces. How has this lineage accumulated such power?"

Six Heavenly Kings! Over thirty Daofuse Realm cultivators! Su Yu quickly calculated. If it came to Heavenly Sovereigns, perhaps Fat Ball could handle one, but as for the rest... March might not agree to help!

As for the Heavenly Kings, Su Yu, Old Wan, Lantian, the Great Zhou King, Marquis Huoyun, General Xuelan, and Marquis Nanxi might not be at a disadvantage. However, if March didn't come, lacking one Heavenly Sovereign could change the entire battle's outcome.

Su Yu licked his lips, "Principal, you and Lantian handle one Heavenly Sovereign... being killed by a Heavenly Sovereign is only natural!"

Wan Tiansheng's eyes flickered, nodding, "Lantian won't be easily killed. Just leave him a clone. As for me... I'll leave some thoughts in the Great Dao, similar to what I left in your heart back then. If I truly can't return, you can wander the River of Time and find my Great Dao. Once you return, find a way to pull me out from the Dao!"

Even before the battle began, Wan Tiansheng had anticipated the outcome. He and Lantian were likely no match for a Heavenly Sovereign!

The probability of being killed was high!

"Su Yu, you should be more worried about yourself!" Wan Tiansheng said gravely, "You're in even greater danger!"

Su Yu nodded, quickly responding, "I know, but if it comes to it, I'll just blow up the Culture King's pen dao!"

Su Yu grinned, "Once the pen dao is gone, others will think I have nothing left! Just right, I'm preparing to open my own Dao. Maybe this is the chance to do it! The pen dao's existence is just a facade!"

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "You really are..."

Su Yu continued, "I have many tricks up my sleeve. The Book of Time can also be used! As long as the Mark of Civilization isn't destroyed, I won't be either. The key lies in the Mark of Civilization; each page is an incarnation of mine!"

Su Yu laughed, "I won't easily get into trouble! Don't worry! The enemy probably knows we're watching them now, so they'll be cautious... We need to strike swiftly, unleash havoc, and then leave! Didn't Heavendoom say he's been hiding since he arrived? Let's satisfy him this time and hit them hard before retreating!"

Wan Tiansheng laughed again.

With that said, the two stopped talking and quickly flew towards their hiding place.

...

Moments later, Su Yu returned and wasted no time, "Get ready. The Great Ming King's formation symbols are all crafted. We'll make our move!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "The enemy is strong, one Heavenly Sovereign, six Heavenly Kings, and thirty Daofuse Realm cultivators!"

He concealed one Heavenly Sovereign, preparing for potential failure.

Everyone gasped!

The Great Zhou King spoke heavily, "So strong, should we still proceed?"

It's too reckless!

Su Yu had promised that this time was just to expose the Chaos lineage, but the enemy was too strong. Such a battle should be avoided if possible.

Su Yu had always fought battles he was sure to win, but now, victory wasn't guaranteed!

Su Yu said coldly, "There's no choice. The enemy is this powerful, and they might have discovered our probing. We must act quickly to prevent them from sending more reinforcements from their lair! They probably didn't expect so many of us to be in the inner circle, nor would they think we'd dare to strike!"

"Catching them off guard should yield some results. If we can kill a few Heavenly Kings, all the better..."

Su Yu smiled, "I said, if we can't win, we'll retreat! It's not like we have to fight to the death!"

The group exchanged glances, still shaken.

So strong, yet we're still fighting?

Su Yu even mentioned they might have been discovered. This time, it's not like the last time at the Sealed Mountain, where pseudo-Dao experts could be restrained. The Chaos lineage can't be restrained, and they have many methods.

The enemy might be just as proficient in probing, sealing, and teleportation as Su Yu's side.

Nearby, Xuelan and others, who had just chatted with Marquis Huoyun, frowned slightly. Xuelan spoke, "Human Lord Su, if the enemy is this strong, isn't a frontal assault too hasty? Even if we've reached some cooperation with the myriad races, it's clear they want us to test the waters with the Chaos lineage. Rushing into a full-scale war... might not be worth it!"

Su Yu squinted, "No, if we succeed this time, killing that Heavenly Sovereign or two Heavenly Kings and two top-tier Daofuse cultivators, we can rescue Marquis Giant Axe!"

"Right now, we need Heavenly Sovereign-level power!"

"I think you all know by now, the Torchbearer lineage is a lie. We need a Heavenly Sovereign because we don't have one now!"

Su Yu smiled, "Don't worry, our strength isn't inferior to theirs! Also, if we encounter danger, I'll find a way to lead everyone out. As long as you trust me, nothing will happen. Just do as I say, and we'll escape... Of course, if you don't trust me, there's nothing I can do!"

Su Yu said no more, turning to the Great Ming King, "Speed up the crafting process. It'd be best if everything is ready by tomorrow. If not, I'll go kill ancient beasts myself. We must act quickly, not giving them a chance to send more reinforcements!"

The Great Ming King nodded, feeling that Su Yu might be too hasty.

The enemy is powerful!

They're not weaklings!

Rushing into an assault, even if victorious, could lead to losses.

Well, let's hope Su Yu has confidence.

Su Yu gave a few more instructions, then looked towards the depths of Chaos Mountain.

Isn't Hundred Battle and Moon Luo fighting deep inside?

Where are they?

Are they fighting to the death, or... are they in love, just watching the show?

Su Yu didn't know!

He only knew that Hundred Battle might not be as useless as he seemed!

That alone was enough.

"Useless Hundred Battle..."

Su Yu muttered, and those who heard it were speechless. This guy still had Hundred Battle on his mind.

He'd curse him whenever he had the chance!

Xuelan and others frowned slightly but said nothing, thinking this new Human Lord was too petty. Hundred Battle's defeat wasn't entirely his fault.

No need to keep harping on it, it seemed a bit narrow-minded!

Su Yu sighed again, "I hope Hundred Battle can kill Moon Luo and return soon. Even as a fighter, he'd be useful. With him, dealing with a Heavenly Sovereign wouldn't be difficult!"

Everyone pretended not to hear. He wanted someone to kill for him, yet he cursed them. Su Yu sometimes had too grandiose ideas.

Su Yu quickly turned to Marquis Tongtian, "Send me back once more. When everyone is ready, I'll return to launch the attack!"

"Understood!"

Everyone responded, excited.

It's just a battle; they've fought many, always victorious!

This time would be no different.

Su Yu never fought unprepared battles, and this time, they'd win again!

Su Yu said no more.

If everyone followed his orders without deviation, nothing would happen. If not... then it's up to them!
