Chapter 839: Su Yu Meets the Human Emperor

"The Human Emperor is coming!"

At this moment, Su Yu was also waiting, anticipating the arrival of the Human Emperor. This legendary figure was someone he was extremely eager to meet. He wondered what impression the first meeting would leave on him. Would it be majesty? Dominance? Elegance? Cunning? Or something else entirely?

Behind him, many others were also filled with anticipation, including some ancient marquises. In ancient times, these individuals were actually marginal figures who rarely had the chance to meet the Human Emperor. Just like now, those in the Sunmoon and Eternal realms seldom saw Su Yu.

Perhaps for Wan Tiansheng and the others, Su Yu was someone they could see every day, but for those in the middle ranks, Su Yu was already someone they rarely interacted with. Even Wan Tiansheng was looking forward to this moment.

However, the Martial Emperor seemed a bit uneasy. He was somewhat worried... worried that the Human Emperor would trouble him. He stole a few glances at Su Yu, reminding him, "You promised to help me deal with the Human Emperor and the Culture King."

Despite his bravado, the Martial Emperor was still somewhat apprehensive about the Human Emperor. Su Yu, however, paid no attention to these concerns. At this moment, the Human Emperor probably had no interest in dealing with the Martial Emperor.

Su Yu could already vaguely sense the aura of the Hundred Battle King. The Hundred Battle King was coming! He didn't sense the presence of anyone else, which wasn't surprising. At this moment, the Human Emperor probably couldn't come in person, not even as a shadow. Most likely, he would send a small avatar.

Behind him, Heavendoom transmitted a message, "Your Majesty, should we give them a show of strength again?"

Su Yu waved his hand. It was enough to give the Hundred Battle King a show of strength to let him know their power. There was no need to do the same for the Human Emperor.

Moments later, in front of them, two figures suddenly appeared before the Hundred Battle King. One was dressed in a golden robe with a crown on his head, looking quite formal. The other wore a brocade robe, somewhat resembling a wealthy landlord.

Although Su Yu had never met them, he knew they were the Human Emperor and the Radiant King. There was no need to sense their aura; their demeanor was enough.

At this moment, Su Yu also stepped forward, a bright smile on his face. From afar, he smiled warmly and gracefully, taking the initiative to greet them, "Junior Su Yu greets Your Majesty the Human Emperor, Radiant King, and Hundred Battle King!"

With nearly a thousand meters still between them, Su Yu bowed in salute. In the distance, the Human Emperor quickened his pace and laughed, "No need to be so polite, Su Human Lord. You are the Lord of the Human Race; there's no need for such formalities..."

"No, Your Majesty the Human Emperor, you are the model of our Human Race and the person I, Su Yu, admire most in my life..."

At this moment, Su Yu's expression turned solemn, his gaze serious as he looked at the Human Emperor from afar, his face full of reverence. You are the person I admire the most!

He looked at the Human Emperor, whose face was somewhat indistinct, but his majesty was still apparent. A square face with a short beard, eyes slightly lacking in spirit—perhaps the real body's gaze was not like this. This was just an avatar of an avatar, lacking some vitality. He walked with the majesty of an emperor and the decisiveness of a warrior.

Sometimes, first impressions are very important. From afar, the Human Emperor smiled, extending his hands in a gesture of support, "What model? You're making me a laughingstock!"

The Human Emperor quickly approached, his laughter hearty, "I've known about you for a long time, the tenth generation Human Lord, Su Yu! Opener of the Heavens! Well done!"

After speaking, he looked at the strong figures behind Su Yu, his laughter still hearty, "All of you have done well. It's been many years since I've seen some old comrades, and now many have become rulers of laws. I've already seen many familiar faces—Giant Axe, Red Moon, Wu Ji, March, Rift Space... they're all here!"

These people, who had been quite vocal before, now that they truly saw the Human Emperor, each quickly saluted, feeling both excited and apprehensive.

The Human Emperor!

Su Yu's majesty was not weak, but compared to the Human Emperor, who had been a legend and myth for tens of thousands of years, he was still a bit lacking. The Martial Emperor, who usually dared to bicker with Su Yu, was now feeling completely uneasy in the presence of the Human Emperor.

Yet, the Human Emperor said nothing to him, nor did he even look at him. He quickly stepped forward to support Su Yu, his smile unwavering, "What a blessing! I never expected that at this final moment, Su Human Lord would come to aid us. It's a blessing for our Human Race, a blessing for our allied races, a blessing for all living beings!"

The Human Emperor expressed his gratitude several times, and then, with a laugh, said, "Today, my true self cannot come, only an avatar, which is somewhat neglectful. However... since you are all here today, we must have a feast to welcome you!"

Su Yu replied with a smile, "Your Majesty the Human Emperor is too kind. These are minor matters. We have come to resolve the threat of the myriad races as soon as possible!"

"No rush!" The Human Emperor laughed, "The myriad races... are just minor ailments!"

Wow, such confidence. Even after being beaten to this state, he still calls them minor ailments!

The Human Emperor seemed to know Su Yu's thoughts and laughed, "I'm old, so let me call myself that. Indeed, I have been entangled with the myriad races for many years, even paying a great price, but the myriad races... are just minor ailments!"

The Human Emperor laughed openly, "Their strength is not weak, but they lack effective action! Their internal divisions are severe, and despite having several times our strength, they dare not risk a battle, always waiting... Are the myriad races truly a major threat?"

To these formidable enemies he had faced for countless years, the Human Emperor actually said they were not a major threat!

Is he just putting on a brave face?

No!

Even now, the Human Emperor genuinely looked down on them!

At this moment, upon meeting, the Human Emperor spoke eloquently, laughing, "The myriad races are not to be feared! Of course, they are strong and difficult to deal with, but difficult does not mean they are a major threat! To use an inappropriate analogy, you are only three years old, and a ten-year-old child bullies you because of his height. That does not mean he is a strong person or a major threat! Therefore, the myriad races are not a major problem..."

Su Yu laughed!

The Human Emperor, at this moment, said that the more than a hundred rulers of laws on the other side were not a major threat... well, that's really bold. Unfortunately, you are bold, but you still lost!

Losing might not be the right word, but the Human Emperor's side was indeed suppressed and unable to move.

"Minor ailments can also be fatal!" Su Yu also laughed, "These guys lack effective execution, but I know one thing about the myriad races: once they reach a life-and-death juncture, they will quickly unite, select a core figure, and take control of the myriad races... So the myriad races are like a spring; the more pressure you apply, the stronger they become!"

The myriad races can be underestimated, but they cannot be underestimated. The more unfavorable the situation for the myriad races, the stronger they become! Just like before, when the myriad races were scattered, once Su Yu's side created enough of a crisis, they were no longer scattered!

After fighting the Human Emperor for countless years, the other side had not been destroyed but had grown much stronger...

So Su Yu thought, the Human Emperor was just comforting him, worried that he might be scared!

Big talk is useless! Strength is what truly matters! A ten-year-old child beating you at three years old is indeed stronger, and there's nothing you can do about it!

The Human Emperor laughed heartily, "Well said! Not underestimating the enemy is the right approach! I was worried that Su Human Lord, being so young, might underestimate the enemy after defeating strong foes in the Myriad Realms. But now, it seems I underestimated Su Human Lord!"

Su Yu smiled, "Your Majesty the Human Emperor can just call me Su Yu. Human Lord... in front of the Human Emperor, you are the true Human Lord, not me!"

"You're joking!" The Human Emperor sighed, then quickly laughed, "The future world is yours! We are old, and I am old too!"

At this moment, he seemed a bit wistful, but quickly added, "You are young, full of vigor, with a promising future! Perhaps soon, my old comrades will have to rely on Su Human Lord for care!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Your Majesty the Human Emperor is too kind!"

"No!" The Human Emperor laughed, looking at the Radiant King beside him, who was still smiling. The Human Emperor patted his shoulder and then looked at Su Yu, "Communicate more with the Radiant King. Over the years, he has managed everything here. He knows all the old comrades well and handles all logistics. The Radiant King is excellent, but he has one flaw: he tends to falter at critical moments..."

At this, the Human Emperor himself laughed, "Otherwise... I should have let him take charge of everything here years ago!"

The meaning behind his words might only be understood by Su Yu and the Radiant King. Su Yu suspected that the Radiant King knew the Human Emperor's situation. And the Human Emperor, perhaps, guessed that Su Yu also knew the situation, so his words suddenly carried a hint of entrusting his legacy!

The Radiant King continued to smile, saying nothing. At this moment, he casually glanced at Su Yu.

And Su Yu, with a bright smile, said, "Your Majesty the Human Emperor is truly too kind. This time, I have come to follow your orders! I am young and straightforward, with no other demands. My only wish is that my brothers who came with me are not used as cannon fodder... everything else will follow your lead!"

"I don't understand the myriad races here, their strength, their tactics, their personalities... War is about intelligence, knowing oneself and the enemy! Here, I know nothing, and I must rely on the seniors for guidance!"

At this moment, Su Yu was quite humble, smiling, "So, from now on, whatever Your Majesty the Human Emperor says, we will do!"

"Hahaha, Brother Su is too modest!"

"......"

For a moment, everyone was stunned. This doesn't seem right! Don't call him Brother Su; you're a hundred thousand-year-old man calling Su Yu brother, and even Su Yu felt a bit uncomfortable. Building relationships shouldn't be done this way!

The Human Emperor himself laughed, glancing at the people behind Su Yu, then at Su Yu, with a sense of nostalgia, "I'm in a good mood, happy, so there's no need to mind these things! I'm very glad you could come this time!"

At this moment, the Human Emperor seemed more sincere, sighing, "You are better than I imagined."

Su Yu showed a puzzled expression, smiling, "What did Your Majesty the Human Emperor imagine me to be like?"

"Hard to say... Arrogant? Proud? Looking down on the world? Perhaps all of these!"

At this moment, the Human Emperor was deeply moved, "Back then, I conquered the Myriad Realms and established the Imperial Court. During that time, I was indeed like that, believing myself invincible, with no one to challenge me. As a result, the Imperial Court collapsed, and the myriad races rebelled..."

Shaking his head, he didn't elaborate further. Instead, he glanced around and said, "Let's have a private chat. Radiant King, Zhan Wang, entertain our brothers for now. It's not suitable to head over there; the myriad races are constantly watching the front line. If we go, it might trigger a major conflict!"

Su Yu nodded. He also wanted to have a private conversation with the Human Emperor.

...

Soon, Su Yu and the Human Emperor walked off to the side alone.

The river of time continued to flow. The Human Emperor's smile gradually faded. "You're a smart and perceptive person. From the first moment I saw you, I knew that those under your command hold you in high regard. Even with me, the Human Emperor, present, they haven't overstepped in the slightest."

Su Yu wanted to speak, but the Human Emperor raised his hand slightly. "This is just an avatar of mine. I can't maintain it for long, so I'll keep it brief."

"Please, go ahead."

"You might know some things about my situation, or perhaps you don't. It doesn't matter."

The Human Emperor spoke calmly, "Years ago, even earlier, when I first led the myriad races away, I was injured, and the injuries were severe!"

"Do you know why I chose to lead the myriad races away back then?"

Su Yu was intrigued. "Were the myriad races planning a rebellion?"

The Human Emperor laughed. "Rebellion? Do you think I'd be afraid of them rebelling?"

At this moment, the Human Emperor suddenly exuded a domineering aura, sneering, "A bunch of people with different agendas, and I'm supposed to fear their rebellion? Even if they did rebel, I could suppress them eventually by making an example of a few and striking the strong while supporting the weak."

Su Yu furrowed his brows. Indeed! So, there was more to the Human Emperor leading the myriad races away?

The Human Emperor didn't keep him in suspense. He directly said, "But I didn't do that. Instead, I led the powerful figures of the myriad races away because I didn't want a war to break out in the Myriad Realms."

The Human Emperor spoke solemnly, "The Myriad Realms aren't as simple as they seem! To put it plainly, I brought the powerful figures of the myriad races into the upper reaches of the River of Time to suppress the Heaven Gate!"

Su Yu's heart stirred. He looked at the Human Emperor, who was gazing upstream, and said calmly, "Ahead, at the end, is where the Heaven Gate is located! I brought the powerful figures of the myriad races here to seal the upper reaches, slowing the flow of the river, essentially to suppress the Heaven Gate and prevent it from opening quickly!"

"At that time, there were already signs. The Culture King and others entering the Heaven Gate was a sign! And coincidentally, the myriad races were stirring... as expected, it was related to some existences within the Heaven Gate!"

The Human Emperor spoke gravely, "The time was too short. I wasn't afraid of the myriad races... but at that time, I couldn't let the Heaven Gate open. Once it opened, we would truly have no chance!"

Su Yu asked seriously, "If the Heaven Gate opens, it must be an enemy?"

"Yes!"

The Human Emperor replied coldly, "It must be an enemy! Su Yu, remember this: when the Three Gates open, everyone is an enemy!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Even Xing?"

"Even Xing!"

The Human Emperor didn't seem surprised that Su Yu knew about Xing or that he might have met Xing.

The Human Emperor spoke solemnly, "Just remember this! The entities within the Three Gates might all be enemies... remember, they might be, but you must treat them as enemies! The Three Gates, the three generations, are not of the same era!"

"The past is the past!"

"Those from the past wanting to return, it's difficult!"

Su Yu was extremely surprised. According to the Human Emperor, they were destined to be enemies with the entities within the Three Gates. Why?

Su Yu asked seriously, "What exactly are the Three Gates?"

The Human Emperor was silent for a moment, then gave an answer: "Sweepers!"

"Hmm?"

Su Yu was shocked. What did that mean?

The Human Emperor explained calmly, "Sweepers! The past, the decayed, those occupying a position without contributing, anything that hinders the future must be swept away! The Three Gates are like sweepers! They seal the decayed era, allowing a new era to begin, a new civilization to continue!"

The Human Emperor sighed, "However, the Myriad Realms are crucial. The Myriad Realms are the key to the revival of the decayed! The destruction of the new era, the return of the old era, clearing away the new era, allows the old decayed era to be reborn!"

Su Yu's eyes grew increasingly strange. "So... we are the new era, and the entities within the Three Gates are destined to be our enemies?"

"That's about right!"

The Human Emperor spoke calmly, "Back then, the Heaven Gate was about to open, but we weren't ready! With no other choice, I could only lead the myriad races into the River of Time. The river is also crucial, remember this! The River of Time is the core of the Myriad Realms and the key... all Three Gates are above the river, including the Earth Gate!"

"We entered the upper reaches, solidifying the River of Time, effectively hindering the revival of the Heaven Gate!"

"The fools of the myriad races might know, or they might not, but their presence indeed helped us hinder the river... but when we return to the Myriad Realms, the solidification of the River of Time will be undone, and the revival of the Heaven Gate... will be unstoppable!"

Su Yu was somewhat enlightened. "So, back then, Your Majesty, the Human Emperor, led the myriad races away not solely because of the rebellion?"

The Human Emperor nodded. "Various factors coincided. On one hand, because the Culture King and others left, on the other hand, the Heaven Gate was about to revive. After much thought, perhaps... only by leading the myriad races to help me suppress the Heaven Gate could I prevent it from opening quickly!"

As he spoke, the Human Emperor sighed again. "However, I still overestimated myself... the myriad races were not weak. At that time, I also inadvertently promoted their determination to unite against external threats. Eventually, the myriad races wanted to join forces against the human race, and I had to fight with all my might... as a result, my physical body was almost completely destroyed, my sea of will shattered, and my strength was reduced to less than one-tenth..."

A sigh filled with regret.

No matter how much you plan, some things are beyond your control!

Su Yu asked solemnly, "Is it serious?"

"Very serious!"

The Human Emperor nodded slightly. "You've also opened your own world, so you should understand that once you open your world, the Great Dao of Time will somewhat reject you. The Great Dao I mastered in the past actually rejects me to some extent! Therefore, recovery is also difficult!"

"What if you sever your world?"

Su Yu frowned. "Sever the world and focus on cultivating the Great Dao! Or sever the Great Dao and focus on the world!"

The Human Emperor shook his head. "It's too late. If you had come earlier, there might have been hope... now, I can't sever the Dao. If I do, I might soon perish, unable to withstand the backlash!"

Su Yu frowned. "Is there no hope for recovery at all?"

"There is."

The Human Emperor smiled, looking at Su Yu with a grin. "If you can reach my level, with Xingyue's Life and Death Path just below yours, then I might have hope."

"First tier or surpassing the first tier?"

Su Yu inquired.

At this moment, their conversation was very direct.

The Human Emperor laughed, "Do you know how the levels of first tier, second tier, and so on are divided?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, shook his head, but still spoke, "It feels like there's a power of shackles, and every time you advance, there's still some feeling!"

"This is a division we made back then based on our own strength and the strength of others, using me and the Culture King as the blueprint!"

He explained the basis for the division back then: "Back then, we established the levels of the ruler of laws based on the power of a normal Great Dao, its explosive force, and other factors. It was just a rough division!"

"This kind of power, we called it the power of one Dao! This was actually the standard of division even in the ancient times, and even earlier!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "So, in ancient times or even earlier, it was divided according to the power of one Dao?"

"Yes!"

The Human Emperor nodded. "Back then, our division of the fifth tier was the power of one Dao! The fourth tier was the power of two Daos! The third tier was the power of four Daos, and the second tier was the power of eight Daos!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. So, the Great Zhou King wasn't lying to him before. The so-called Seven Dao Supreme was indeed at the peak of the third tier.

I thought he was lying to me.

But now, the Great Zhou King is considered to have the power of nine Daos, right? That means he's in the second tier?

He's definitely reached the second tier now!

In this light, Xing... might not be that strong. Otherwise, with seven Daos, just the peak of the third tier, what's the big deal about calling it the strongest?

"Then the first tier, does it also double, with the power of 16 Daos?"

Su Yu asked, and the Human Emperor smiled. "That's about right. Anything exceeding the power of 16 Daos is considered the first tier. Back then, there was no one stronger than us in the Myriad Realms, so dividing further was meaningless!"

These words had a bit of a boastful tone!

We divided up to the first tier not because we couldn't go further, but because there was no one stronger than us!

Why divide further?

Leave the first tier empty?

But... Su Yu furrowed his brows. "Then back then, with the Culture King and Your Majesty being so powerful, couldn't you take down the myriad races?"

Why wait until the Culture King disappeared to solve the problem!

The Human Emperor sighed. "As you said, when the myriad races are pushed to the extreme, they tend to unite, which is not conducive to the unity of our human race! Moreover, if a war truly breaks out, the losses would be significant! Actually, if given a little more time, the myriad races wouldn't be a concern!"

"And the Culture King leaving..."

The Human Emperor sighed. "It was also out of necessity. Something happened with the Wen Codex, and he had to leave! Before leaving, he asked me if we should resolve the threat of the myriad races before he left."

Su Yu was taken aback. So, the Culture King wasn't really that unreliable. Before leaving, he asked the Human Emperor, clearly worried about potential problems.

As it turned out, the Human Emperor must have refused.

Why refuse?

The Human Emperor smiled. "At that time, I didn't agree! There were many reasons, but the main one was that if a major war broke out, both the Culture King and I would be severely injured... but we could take down the myriad races! However, if we were both severely injured, the Heaven Gate would open, Wen Yu would die, and he wouldn't be able to rescue her... it wasn't worth it!"

So, he gave up on taking action when the Culture King left.

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Was it the Control King who set this up? Deliberately causing trouble for the Time Sage, knowing that you wouldn't choose to fight to the death at that moment, leading to the current situation?"

"There was an element of Control," the Human Emperor nodded slightly. "But Control wasn't the main planner! The mastermind wasn't from the Human Gate, but from the Earth Gate. The Three Gates had some conflicting interests. At that time, they knew the Heaven Gate was about to open and that it housed many powerful beings. So, they set a trap to ensnare Wenyu, aiming to provoke conflict with the Heaven Gate or suppress it..."

The Human Emperor chuckled. "However, we didn't let them have it easy. Before leaving, I reinforced the Earth Gate, and when I reached the upper reaches of the River of Time, I also affected the opening of the Human Gate! I insisted on dragging the Three Gates to open simultaneously... so none of them could gain an advantage!"

Su Yu was surprised. This person... was truly formidable. Before leaving, he had arranged everything for the Three Gates. No one could emerge first!

Indeed, there were issues with the events of the past. The Human Emperor's main goal in taking away the myriad races wasn't for their sake but to delay the opening of the Three Gates. This was something Su Yu hadn't considered before.

"So, unless I reach the first rank, or even stronger, there's no hope of healing Your Majesty's injuries?"

"Yes! There's hope, at least," the Human Emperor sighed. "It's difficult. You... rose a bit late! According to my expectations, it should have been much earlier! I set many obstacles for the myriad races and left many contingencies for the human race..."

It was somewhat tragic. Damn it, you only emerged at the end. If you had risen a few hundred or thousand years earlier, things would have been different.

Seeing Su Yu's indifferent expression, he smiled lightly. "You're progressing quickly now, but don't you feel you've hit a bottleneck?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. Indeed! At this stage, he had reached a bottleneck, and advancing further was extremely difficult!

Su Yu didn't dwell on it too much and laughed. "That's a matter for later. As for Your Majesty's contingencies... they were all ruined by Great Zhou King Zhou Tian. That's not my fault. I didn't inherit many benefits, and Zhou Tian keeps things hidden from me. The main issue is that Your Majesty's choice of candidate wasn't suitable!"

"......"

The Human Emperor was speechless. Was this... a complaint? Perhaps it was.

He laughed. "Zhou Tian... is actually a capable minister! My intention was for him to assist a powerful Human Lord to emerge. Now it seems there were indeed some issues."

Su Yu continued, "He claims to be a 15-path supreme, so why didn't he just wipe out the myriad races from the start..."

"15 paths?" The Human Emperor was slightly taken aback. "Did he reach 15 paths? Before I left, he was only at 7 paths. Has he progressed so quickly? But... back then, I sealed a section of the River of Time, so he should have found it difficult to advance. I sealed everything indiscriminately to prevent any mistakes."

Oh! So, he was indeed at 7 paths back then! But recently, he advanced by two more paths. The key is... this guy's 7 paths weren't severed!

So, Great Zhou King is earning from both ends—two paths in Su Yu's world and 7 paths in the River of Time. Very impressive!

Indeed, the Human Emperor is an honest man. I asked, and he just told me.

Su Yu asked again, "Was he also sealed before?"

"Sort of, but in an emergency, he could be unsealed. However, if he unsealed himself, the entire Myriad Realms would be unsealed!"

The Human Emperor nodded.

Su Yu was speechless. I get it now. Great Zhou King was actually the key to unsealing. This guy is really patient! He just wouldn't unseal himself! He endured until the very end!

The Human Emperor didn't dwell on Great Zhou King and quickly said, "I also need to emphasize the strength of the myriad races to you!"

Su Yu listened attentively. Xingyue had only mentioned a rough number, not the specific strength.

"The myriad races back then weren't as strong as they are now. Currently, the myriad races have a total of 125 rulers of laws!"

Seeing Su Yu's calm demeanor, the Human Emperor cursed inwardly. Don't ask; his sister must have told him, or else this kid wouldn't be so composed.

"Among them, a few were close to the first rank back then but hadn't reached it. Now, a few have!"

"The Immortal Emperor, Demon Emperor, and Divine Emperor have definitely reached the first rank. As for the Dragon Emperor and Nether Emperor, even if they haven't, they're close!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "So many first ranks, what about our human race?"

Is it just the Radiant King?

Even the so-called sixth person, the Battle King, hasn't reached it.

"Our human race naturally has first ranks as well. The Radiant King is not only a first rank but also a strong one among them. As for me... those three first ranks also fear me. I could suppress all three of them alone... although now I'm actually powerless..."

The Human Emperor smiled self-deprecatingly. "Besides the Radiant King, there are other first ranks! The Martial King's dao companion is also a first rank..."

Dao companion?

Su Yu was stunned! What kind of title is that?

Seeing his confusion, the Human Emperor explained, "It's the first dao companion. The Martial King had a penchant for romance and married 18 dao companions over time!"

"......"

Speechless!

So, his dao companion is here too?

The Martial Emperor is doomed! Never mind the Martial King; his wife is here and has reached the first rank. You're finished!

You still want revenge on the Martial King?

Heh!

The Human Emperor continued, "The Radiant King's dao companion is also a first rank!"

Su Yu was stunned again. What the heck?

He looked at the Human Emperor, who coughed lightly and said, "It's normal. Back then, when the Four Extremes Human Kings and the 36 Kings were conferred, it wasn't the entire human race! Some women back then were very strong, holding up half the sky, but they didn't want to show their faces, so they weren't conferred."

"Also, the Battle King's dao companion might be stronger than the Battle King..."

Su Yu was taken aback!

Oh my!

This... how tragic, aren't they all henpecked husbands?

No, the Martial King's wife is so formidable, yet he still married over a dozen!

The Human Emperor laughed. "So, the human race is also very strong. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to hold on! Especially the Martial King, who actually made significant contributions. Of his 18 dao companions, 9 are still alive, half of them! Among these 9, one is a first rank, one is a second rank, and the remaining 7 are third ranks..."

Su Yu inhaled sharply. "So, of the 42 rulers of laws in the human race, 9 are from his family?"

Oh my!

That's a bit terrifying!

Most families have one or two at most, but your family, not counting the Martial King, has 9!

"42?" The Human Emperor was taken aback, then quickly laughed. "Not just 42, now it's 52. A few are always patrolling the front and rear lines, which Xingyue probably forgot to count."

Alright!

He immediately knew it was his sister who leaked the information.

But Xingyue, being a homebody, didn't wander around much. How would she know there were still many strong individuals secretly patrolling the front and rear lines?

The Human Emperor laughed. "In total, there are 52. Counting you all, that's 88. It's actually fewer than the myriad races, but not by much!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. That's acceptable.

The key is, he suddenly wanted to gossip a bit and laughed. "Do the Martial King's 9 wives fight often?"

"......"

The Human Emperor was speechless. You... you're asking me this?

That's not appropriate!

So young, how can you be so gossipy!

I can't answer that for you!

After thinking for a moment, the Human Emperor coughed lightly, suddenly took out a small booklet, and tossed it to Su Yu. "See for yourself. I'm not very interested in these things, but someone else recorded some images for me. This is a copy... just take a look yourself, don't spread it!"

He added, "Don't provoke his 9 dao companions... they're quite... fierce!"

The Human Emperor coughed again, "Very fierce!"

"......"

Su Yu held the booklet, speechless for a moment!

So, you're a gossip too?

Alright!

Indeed, every emperor likes to collect information and be a gossip, right?

What do you mean someone else collected it? I don't believe it.

They say the Martial King's wife is a first rank. Could anyone else collect that information?

No need to say more; it was you!

The key is 9... my goodness, the Martial Emperor is doomed!

If he dares to seek revenge, Su Yu shudders at the thought. With 9 of them charging at once, the Martial Emperor will definitely be beaten to death!

At this moment, he glanced sympathetically at the Martial Emperor in the rear, who happened to be looking at him. Seeing Su Yu's gaze, the Martial Emperor was slightly taken aback. That gaze... wasn't very friendly!

The Human Emperor also saw it and laughed heartily. "The Martial Emperor... is still alive, not easy!"

He naturally knew about the grudge between the Martial Emperor and the Martial King and laughed. "The grudge between him and the Martial King, let's not get involved. The Martial King had his reasons for dealing with him back then..."

Su Yu laughed. "The Martial Emperor slept with his childhood sweetheart?"

The Human Emperor laughed. "You know about that too?"

"......"

Alright, the two exchanged a smile, everything understood without words!

Of course, the Human Emperor still explained, "Not just that! Mainly, the Martial Emperor is rather reckless and somewhat foolish, to be honest. But... sometimes the heavens are blind and gave him the Heaven Gate! This guy opened the Heaven Gate and didn't focus on his duties. He was always fixated on his little patch of land. That would have been fine, but during that period, he suddenly became interested in the Heaven Gate... almost causing it to open... Sealing him had something to do with that!"

Su Yu was surprised. "Your Majesty means that sealing him was because he almost opened the Heaven Gate?"

The Human Emperor nodded. "Otherwise, there was no need to seal him. It was just to prevent him from causing more trouble. If we wanted to kill him, we would have done it long ago! But he didn't do it on purpose, and we didn't mention it. If we did, that fool might deliberately open the Heaven Gate! He always thinks highly of himself, believing he's invincible. If you say opening the Heaven Gate is dangerous, he might deliberately open it. His arrogance is immense; he doesn't even take the Master of Time seriously..."

Su Yu pondered for a moment and nodded.

Back then, when Su Yu had inquired about the Lord of the Undead, the Martial Emperor had scoffed, dismissing him as nothing more than a fool who hadn't fully opened the Heaven Gate. Such arrogance! If the Lord of the Undead were present, he could have obliterated him with a single breath!

At this moment, Su Yu chuckled. So, the Martial Emperor was sealed—that was the crux of the matter! No wonder! He thought, why didn't the Human Emperor and the others just kill him? Why bother sealing him? It turned out they merely wanted to prevent him from opening the Heaven Gate again, rather than truly wishing to kill him. If it were solely about the Martial King, he would have either been killed or the matter would have been resolved long ago. There was no need to seal him.

The fact that he almost opened the Heaven Gate... Su Yu made a mental note of this. It could be of great use!

At this moment, Su Yu and the Human Emperor were having their first face-to-face conversation, and it was going quite well. They seemed to share a common interest in collecting gossip. That was a good sign!

Meanwhile, the Human Emperor silently observed Su Yu, a faint smile appearing on his face. This kid... he didn't seem that difficult to deal with after all. Not bad! He had been worried about encountering someone troublesome, but it seemed manageable now. Hopefully, he wouldn't cause any trouble!
