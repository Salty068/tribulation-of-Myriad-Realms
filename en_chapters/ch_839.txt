Chapter 839: Su Yu Meets the Human Emperor

“The Human Emperor is coming!”

At this moment, Su Yu was also waiting, waiting for the Human Emperor's arrival.

He was extremely expectant of this legendary figure.

He wondered what impression the first meeting would leave him with.

Majesty?
Domineering?
Refined?
Scheming?
Or something else?

Behind him, many others were also expectant, including some ancient marquises. In ancient times, these individuals were actually considered peripheral figures, rarely seeing the Human Emperor. It was similar to Su Yu's current situation, where those Sunmoon and Eternal cultivators didn't see Su Yu often.

Perhaps Wan Tiansheng and the others saw Su Yu daily, but for those in the middle ranks, Su Yu no longer paid much attention.

Even Wan Tiansheng was quite expectant at this moment.

Martial Emperor, however, seemed a little uneasy.

He was somewhat worried… worried that the Human Emperor would come looking for trouble with him. He secretly glanced at Su Yu a few times. *You said you'd help me deal with the Human Emperor and Culture King.*

Despite his bravado, Martial Emperor was still a little intimidated by the Human Emperor.

Su Yu didn't pay attention to any of that.

At this point, the Human Emperor probably wasn't interested in Martial Emperor's situation anyway.

He could already vaguely sense Zhan Wang's aura.

Zhan Wang was coming!

Su Yu wasn't surprised that he didn't sense anyone else's aura. At this moment, the Human Emperor's true body probably couldn't come, nor could a shadow. Most likely, a small clone would be sent over.

Behind him, Heavendoom sent a voice transmission. “Your Majesty, should we give them another show of force?”

Su Yu waved his hand.

A show of force was only necessary for Zhan Wang, to let him know their strength. There was no need for it with the Human Emperor.

A moment later, in front.

Before Zhan Wang, two figures suddenly appeared. One wore a golden robe and a crown, looking quite formal. The other wore a brocade robe, somewhat resembling a local magnate.

Though Su Yu hadn't met them, he knew they were the Human Emperor and Radiant King. He didn't need to sense their auras; their bearing alone was enough.

At this moment, Su Yu also stepped forward.

A brilliant smile bloomed on his face!

From a distance, Su Yu's smile was radiant, his voice gentle and refined. He proactively said with a laugh, “Junior Su Yu greets His Majesty the Human Emperor, and Seniors Radiant King and Zhan Wang!”

With nearly a thousand meters still between them, Su Yu bowed. In the distance, the Human Emperor quickened his pace and laughed, “Too polite, Human Lord Su is the Human Lord; there's no need to bow…”

“No, Your Majesty the Human Emperor is a paragon of our human race, and the person Su Yu respects most in this life…”

At this moment, Su Yu's expression was serious and solemn. He looked at the Human Emperor from afar, his face grave. *You are the one I admire

He shook his head, not dwelling on the matter. Soon, he looked around and said, “Let’s talk alone for a bit! Radiant King, Battle King, please entertain these brothers. It’s not suitable to go over there right now. The Myriad Races are constantly watching the front line; if everyone goes over, it could easily trigger a major war!”

Su Yu nodded.

He also wanted to speak with the Human Emperor alone.

…

Soon, Su Yu and the Human Emperor walked off to the side to talk privately.

The River of Time still flowed.

The Human Emperor’s smile gradually faded. “You are a clever person, and an understanding one! The first time I saw you, I knew that those under you held you in awe and respect. Even with me, the Human Emperor, present, they did not overstep their bounds in the slightest.”

Su Yu wanted to speak, but the Human Emperor raised a hand. “This is merely a clone of mine; it cannot last long, so I will be brief.”

“Please speak, Human Emperor.”

“Perhaps you know some things about my situation, perhaps you don’t. It doesn’t matter.”

The Human Emperor said calmly, “Years ago, even further back, when I first led the Myriad Races away, I was already severely injured! My wounds were very grave!”

“Do you know why I chose to lead the Myriad Races away back then?”

Su Yu grew interested. “The Myriad Races were rebelling?”

The Human Emperor chuckled.

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Was it the Control King who framed them? Deliberately causing trouble for the Time Sage, then knowing that the two of you wouldn't choose to go for mutual destruction at that time, which led to the current outcome?"

"The Control King was a factor."

The Human Emperor nodded slightly. "However, the Control King wasn't the main schemer! The one who orchestrated this came either from the Human Gate or the Earth Gate. The Three Gates also have some conflicts of interest. At that time, the Heaven Gate was about to open, and they knew there were many powerful experts there. So, they deliberately set a trap, harming Wenyu, with the actual goal of making us clash with the Heaven Gate, or perhaps to suppress the Heaven Gate..."

The Human Emperor chuckled as he spoke. "But we didn't let them off easy either. Before I left, I reinforced the Earth Gate, and when I reached the upper reaches of the River of Time, I actually affected the opening of the Human Gate! I insisted on dragging all Three Gates to open simultaneously... so none of them could gain an advantage!"

Su Yu was surprised. This one... was truly formidable.

Before leaving, he had made arrangements for all Three Gates.

No one would be able to emerge first!

Indeed, there had been some issues back then. The Human Emperor taking the Myriad Races away wasn't primarily for the Myriad Races themselves, but to delay the opening of the Three Gates.

This was something Su Yu hadn't considered

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded.

He recalled how, when he'd asked about the Undead Emperor, the Martial Emperor had spoken with such arrogance, calling him a mere fool who hadn't fully opened his Dao... With that attitude, it was a good thing the Undead Emperor wasn't around, otherwise, he would have been annihilated in a single breath!

At this moment, Su Yu smiled. So, the Martial Emperor being sealed was the key! No wonder!

He had wondered why the Human Emperor and the others didn't just kill him. Why bother sealing him? It turned out they just didn't want him to open the Heaven Gate again, not that they truly wanted to kill him. If it were merely a matter concerning the Martial King, he would either have been killed or long forgotten; there would be no need to seal him.

"Almost opened the Heaven Gate..." Su Yu made a mental note of that phrase. It would be very useful!

At this moment, Su Yu and the Human Emperor were talking face-to-face for the first time, and the conversation was going rather well. They even seemed to share a common hobby: collecting gossip. This was excellent!

Meanwhile, the Human Emperor silently observed Su Yu, a faint smile gracing his lips. This brat... didn't seem so difficult after all. Not bad! He was just afraid of encountering troublesome ones, but now it seemed Su Yu was manageable. "Just don't cause me any trouble!"
