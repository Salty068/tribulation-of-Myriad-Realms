Chapter 800: Chaotic Battle and Slaughter (Seeking Subscription)

"Su Yu!"

As Su Yu led his people in retreat, a furious shout echoed through the air.

Su Yu again!

The two Heavenly Venerables weren't dead yet!

At that moment, Su Yu suddenly halted, turning back with a puzzled expression towards Feng Zun. "What's the matter?" he asked, feigning confusion.

Feng Zun was livid!

What's the matter?

Just as she was about to erupt, Su Yu suddenly took out the Sea of Will of the Dragon Heavenly Venerable. While everyone thought he was about to kill, Su Yu swiftly extracted the power of chaos from heaven and earth, quickly helping the Dragon Heavenly Venerable restore his physical body.

In the blink of an eye, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable's body grew stronger, leaving him in a daze.

Su Yu quickly restored his body and said, "I can only temporarily borrow the power of chaos. There's not enough physical power left. Restoring a bit is better than nothing. You almost died, you fool. This time, Longpanshan is my repayment for your life-saving grace. We're even now! I, Su Yu, owe nothing to anyone!"

In the midst of the Dragon Heavenly Venerable's shock and the others' stupor, Su Yu swiftly restored the Dragon Heavenly Venerable's body. Although weaker than before, it was far quicker than if he had done it himself. In an instant, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable's strength was restored to over sixty percent.

Su Yu kicked the Dragon Heavenly Venerable back into the battlefield, shouting, "What are you looking at? Keep fighting!"

"......"

Silence fell over the battlefield.

The Dragon Heavenly Venerable's eyes were filled with complex emotions. Without a word, he flew towards Feng Heavenly Venerable. Feng Heavenly Venerable, who hadn't reacted in time earlier, also quickly flew towards the Dragon Heavenly Venerable.

The two had always been dual cultivators, considered Dao companions. Now, they quickly reunited.

They watched Tiangu and the others with extreme vigilance, and their eyes were filled with anger towards the demons. Of course, there was also a deep-seated resentment towards Tiangu.

Tiangu's expression changed slightly.

Looking at Su Yu again, his gaze completely transformed.

Su Yu!

Was this a ploy to sow discord?

Or something else?

He had chosen to sacrifice a piece, thinking that if both the Dragon Heavenly Venerable and the axe-wielding expert died, then so be it.

But... the Dragon Heavenly Venerable lived!

And the axe-wielding expert... Su Yu was rapidly stripping away the power of the Great Dao. In almost an instant, a Great Dao was peeled away, and as it was stripped, Su Yu punched a light orb into oblivion.

Boom!

The Chaos Mountain region trembled. There was no energy fluctuation, only the violent tremor of a Heavenly Venerable's fall and the stripping of the Great Dao.

Killed!

Indeed, Su Yu was not one to show mercy. He was worried that if someone didn't die, they might come back to life and cause trouble.

At this moment, he quickly finished off the axe-wielding expert, restored the Dragon Heavenly Venerable a bit, and then kicked him away. Seeing Su Yu kill the axe-wielding expert, the Dragon Heavenly Venerable, who had just been captured by Su Yu, felt a mix of fear and complexity.

The Dragon Heavenly Venerable said in a deep voice, "Thank you, Human Lord. Longpanshan is my gift to you. Consider this matter settled!"

Can it really be settled?

A life-saving grace!

Let's call it settled!

Su Yu had killed many dragons, but today, at this moment, Su Yu's choice stunned everyone.

Everyone thought he would capture someone and run, but he didn't. He just moved aside, stripped the Great Dao from the axe-wielding expert, and released the Dragon Heavenly Venerable.

At this moment, Giant Axe, March, and the others were still a bit dazed. Not running?

They thought Su Yu was going to run!

But... he wasn't!

......

Of course, Su Yu wasn't running.

The battle had just begun. Why would he run?

At first, capturing two Seas of Will, he did think about running. He had profited greatly, obtaining the Great Dao of two Heavenly Venerables. It was a huge gain, so he thought about running first.

But then he turned around and thought... why run?

The battle had just begun!

Several Heavenly Venerables had already died. Clearly, many more would die today. He couldn't afford to lose out on this opportunity. Conveniently, he released the Dragon Heavenly Venerable to add trouble for Tiangu and the others!

Tiangu sacrificed a piece, but the Dragon Heavenly Venerable didn't die. Feng Heavenly Venerable was his Dao companion. Suddenly, two Heavenly Venerables probably hated Tiangu to death. Sure, the Immortal Clan was powerful, and they might not act now, but it could be useful later.

Could the myriad races truly unite?

That wouldn't do!

The myriad races needed to be in chaos. Previously, Su Yu needed them united, but now he couldn't wait for them to fall into internal strife.

Times change!

The situation on the battlefield shifted instantly.

When Su Yu released the Dragon Heavenly Venerable and killed the axe-wielding expert, suddenly, the four Heavenly Venerables—Yuan Sheng, Ming, Dragon, and Phoenix—plus Tiangu, the Heavenly King, faced off against Mo Tian, Mo Heavenly Venerable, and the white-haired elder.

The Sun Corona also broke free from its seal, now confronting Moon Battle. The Sun Corona was not as strong as the Control King Ancestor.

And the Divine Empress faced a formidable female demon.

The situation had changed!

Even though two Heavenly Venerables from the Control King's lineage had died, on this side, Moon Heavenly Venerable was crippled, Dragon Heavenly Venerable's strength was greatly diminished, and without the Demon Clan's Heavenly Venerable, the balance of power shifted.

Su Yu's side, with six Heavenly Venerables, became a pivotal force!

At this moment, Tiangu couldn't care about anything else. He looked at the Demon Clan members, then at the female powerhouse opposite the Divine Empress, and said in a low voice, "Marquis Ziyun, what are you after?"

"What am I after?"

The female demon's eyes were like lightning, incredibly powerful. "Nothing! The Sacred Clan and Demon Clan are one family. What do you think I'm after?"

With that, her eyes turned cold as she looked at the distant Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger. "Are you two really going to betray Chaos?"

"Betray?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger's eyes darted around, no longer fighting the twin opponents. "We're not betraying, just having some fun... has the myriad races changed again?"

The Demon Clan actually allied with the Control King's lineage!

No, according to Marquis Ziyun, they were one family!

At this time, even the Daofuse experts from the Demon Clan were bewildered, retreating one after another. Earlier, they were fighting to the death, and now they were one family?

Tiangu had speculated before, but seeing the other side truly betray the myriad races' camp still left him a bit helpless.

The Demon Clan had truly sided with the Control King!

Why?

Because of the Flame Demon Emperor?

It was said that the current Control King's lineage was the descendants of the Flame Demon Emperor and the Control King.

The ancestor of the Control King's lineage, Moon Battle, also looked at Marquis Ziyun and said in a deep voice, "You acted too late! Sword Servant and Dou He are dead!"

Two Heavenly Venerables had died!

On the myriad races' side, although Moon Heavenly Venerable was injured, his Sea of Will remained, and the Dragon Heavenly Venerable had at least sixty percent of his strength restored. Of course, he was much weaker now, probably only at the Heavenly King level.

But dead was dead.

They had lost two Heavenly Venerables!

Marquis Ziyun's eyes were like lightning. "I didn't expect the situation to change so quickly!"

With that, she looked at Su Yu's side, then at the Divine Empress blocking her path, and said coldly, "Divine Empress, why bother? If you fight me now, you might not be able to kill me. Instead, how long can you live? Without you, will the Divine Clan rely on the Sun Corona to revive?"

The Immortal Clan had four Heavenly Venerables, while the Divine Clan, counting the Divine Empress, had only three.

Now, the situation was even more chaotic. Who belonged to whom? They might not even know themselves.

The Divine Empress silently watched her, her aura fluctuating, and said calmly, "I've lived long enough! I'm just curious... when did you start colluding with them? It shouldn't have been too early, right?"

Marquis Ziyun smiled, "Not too early."

"Why? Bloodline?"

The Divine Empress showed a hint of doubt, but from afar, Su Yu laughed, "What bloodline? I guess some message might have been sent from the Gate of Hell, like... perhaps the Flame Demon Emperor is also in the Gate of Hell? Did he send a message to the Demon Clan?"

As soon as he said this, Marquis Ziyun couldn't help but look at Su Yu and laughed, "You must be that Su Yu from the Human Clan? Truly clever! You're right, but..."

"Kill!"

Boom!

Su Yu swung a hammer, leaving everyone stunned again.

Damn!

He's fighting again?

And Su Yu roared, "This woman annoys me. Thunderstorm, let's join forces to kill her. Divine Empress, go team up with the Sun Corona to fight that ancestor!"

The six Heavenly Venerables, all following Su Yu's lead.

Whatever he said, they did!

He said fight... so they fought!

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed as Su Yu went berserk, swinging his hammer wildly. Fat Ball smashed with a boot, March swung bamboo, Giant Axe chopped, Destiny locked on, and Thunderstorm unleashed thunderous power...

Even the Divine Empress was shocked as the loud explosion rang out. The once-powerful Marquis Ziyun was instantly shattered, her blood splattering across the sky, and the thunderous power was devoured by Fat Ball.

To be honest, Su Yu had his eyes on this woman's thunderous power!

A top-tier Heavenly Venerable!

Very powerful!

Killing her and integrating her thunderous power into his Great Dao might create a top-tier pseudo-Heavenly Venerable. He had strong subordinates who cultivated thunderous power.

Moreover... if he didn't fight this woman, it seemed the myriad races were considering retreating.

They couldn't retreat!

He hadn't seen enough of the show yet!

If they didn't kill seven or eight Heavenly Venerables today, Su Yu wouldn't be satisfied.

The six of them attacked instantly, and then Su Yu roared, "Alright, everyone, go all out. No more holding back. No more playing around. Kill her and show them our strength!"

"Roar!"

"Howl!"

"Fight!"

At this moment, the other five, apart from Su Yu, no longer held back.

From all sides, even the Control King's lineage wanted to come to aid, but... it was too late, no time. The Divine Empress truly disregarded everything, rushing to join forces with the Sun Corona to fight Moon Battle.

Moon Battle roared in anger!

On the Demon Clan's side, Mo Heavenly Venerable and Mo Tian's expressions changed, rushing towards Su Yu. Su Yu's voice echoed, "Tiangu, if you can't stop them, I'll immediately turn against you and attack!"

Tiangu's expression changed slightly. Su Yu... could really do it!

"Kill!"

With a low shout, Tiangu and the others moved to intercept.

Six formidable figures surrounded Marquis Ziyun, launching a relentless assault. Su Yu laughed heartily, "I dislike those who hide for ages, only to appear suddenly and try to turn the tide. Do you understand?"

"You, who just showed up, trying to play the hero? Think you can change the outcome?"

"Everyone, attack!"

The power of various Great Daos surged wildly. The six powerhouses were incredibly strong, and in the blink of an eye, Marquis Ziyun didn't even have time to self-destruct. Not that she intended to, but—boom! Her body exploded completely!

In Su Yu's hands, chains, ropes, and brushes appeared, sealing off the Great Daos. In an instant, he suppressed her sea of will and her Dao. Under the furious gaze of the Demon Race, Su Yu made a decisive stroke!

Boom!

The Great Dao trembled, and with a loud bang, a gap appeared, releasing a torrent of the power of laws. Su Yu quickly collected it, and finally, with a punch, shattered the sea of will!

In the sky, winds rose and clouds surged!

At this moment, even the lower realms reacted, the Great Dao trembled as if the heavens had changed!

This was a being who, once unsealed, could reach the level of a ruler of laws. Yet, she had only been out for about... 30 seconds?

And she was already brutally taken down by Su Yu and his group!

Everyone was stunned by this scene.

Tiangu and the others were all in a daze.

Six against one, killing a Heavenly Sovereign wasn't surprising. Even if Marquis Ziyun was powerful, she couldn't withstand so many opponents.

The key was... Su Yu had been playing the bystander for so long, and everyone thought he would continue to watch both sides suffer. But... he didn't. From saving Dragon Heavenly Sovereign to killing Marquis Ziyun, his series of actions left everyone dumbfounded!

Why?

No one could understand Su Yu's actions anymore!

And Su Yu, having killed Marquis Ziyun, breathed a sigh of relief, sweating profusely. He looked around and chuckled, "Sorry, got a bit carried away. Mainly, I can't stand those who hide in the back and jump out at the critical moment, wanting to be the savior, the protagonist!"

As he spoke, he deliberately glanced at Thunderstorm, who felt a slight tremor in his heart.

He knew what Su Yu was implying!

Clearly, it wasn't just about Marquis Ziyun, but also about Hundred Battle and his son. Su Yu's attitude was clear: anyone trying to secretly overturn everything would be killed!

The protagonist wasn't them!

This play was controlled by Su Yu, and it would remain under his control. Any disruptors would be killed, even if it meant exposing his strength!

This scene unfolded so quickly.

It was unbelievably fast!

Moreover, at this moment, Su Yu's displayed strength was much stronger than before. He could even single-handedly suppress Marquis Ziyun, with the other five merely playing supporting roles.

Su Yu, with his white hair flying and a radiant smile, looked around and towards the depths of the mountains, "Have you absorbed enough? So many Heavenly Sovereigns have died, and you've been stealing my spoils, my power of laws. Have you had enough? When will you come out?"

At this moment, Su Yu's gaze was fixed on the deep mountains, as if he saw a door.

Yes, Su Yu sensed it.

Amidst the great battle, it seemed there was a grand formation underground, extracting the power of laws from the fallen powerhouses, including their blood and flesh.

Su Yu looked at Moon Battle again, sneering, "Grandson, go back! Defend! Enough people have died, it's enough for your mother to come out! You, grandson, have a ruthless heart, not going all out to save people, right? Really, you watched the axe-wielder and the sword-wielder die just to let your mother out sooner, right?"

At these words, some people's expressions changed.

Moon Battle looked coldly at Su Yu, not responding, but instead shouted, "Retreat!"

A group of powerhouses quickly retreated inward.

At this moment, on this side, Moon Battle, Moon Hao, Moon Luo, the white-haired elder, the twins, and the two from the Demon Race, a total of eight powerhouses, retreated behind the Eight Domains Locking Heaven Formation.

Besides these eight, there was also the projection of the Dragon Beast, which quickly followed in retreat.

And the Heavenly Kings, who were more than ten before, were now only half remaining.

On the side of the myriad races, everyone gathered, each panting heavily, looking at Su Yu with astonishment.

Tiangu said in a deep voice, "Is she coming out?"

Su Yu looked into the depths and smiled, "Soon!"

Tiangu frowned, "You sensed it, so... why not stop it?"

Why didn't Su Yu stop the extraction of power?

They hadn't even had time to sense it!

Su Yu sneered, "Foolish! Stop what? If she comes out now, she'll lose some strength. If we wait longer, you won't be able to take down these grandsons, and she'll come out even stronger! Let her come out, so what?"

Su Yu had weighed the pros and cons before making his decision!

Besides, it wasn't that easy to stop. Moon Battle and the others had probably set up the formation long ago!

Su Yu said no more. As these powerhouses retreated, others couldn't retreat as quickly. He led a few Heavenly Sovereigns, truly unstoppable, slaughtering madly under everyone's watchful eyes. In the blink of an eye, dozens of ancient beasts and more than ten Daofuse experts from the Control King's lineage were slaughtered by them!

Su Yu collected all the corpses, as for the myriad races' corpses... except for the Demon Race, he temporarily left the others untouched. Tiangu and the others were also quickly collecting corpses, fearing Su Yu would take them away!

In this battle so far, Su Yu had collected a large pile of corpses!

Several Heavenly Sovereigns had died, and many Heavenly Kings had also fallen.

Giant Axe and the others felt like they had no opponents, killing whoever they encountered. The myriad races and the Control King's lineage were helpless, and at this moment, they were all grinning brightly.

After a round of slaughter, the number of powerhouses in the field suddenly decreased significantly.

And at this time, in the depths, a portal appeared, faintly visible.

In the portal, a woman in black armor was faintly visible, seemingly about to step out. Her voice echoed, icy and bone-chilling, "Su Yu, when I come out, I'll kill you first!"

Su Yu grinned, "If you come out and I don't kill you today, I'm not Su Yu! No one else should interfere! Tiangu, I'm a reasonable person, right? I helped you kill several Heavenly Sovereigns, and you guys, a bunch of useless ones, couldn't kill even one... Now, with this woman coming out, I guarantee, if the six of us can't kill her, we won't retreat from the battle!"

Su Yu's aura grew stronger, his smile wild, "I love this kind of chaotic battle! If we don't annihilate the Sin Clan today, it shows my incompetence! If we're going to play, let's play big. If we don't kill a ruler of laws, we won't know what the heavens are called!"

Tiangu and the others were silent at this moment.

The woman was really about to come out.

And at this moment, the Control King's lineage retreated behind the formation. Previously, they had come out to fight, but it seemed they were deliberately sending people to their deaths, or rather, killing as many as they could to extract power and draw the opponent out.

And at this moment, the myriad races were actually at a disadvantage.

Even if several Heavenly Sovereigns had died on the other side, there were still many.

Especially with Moon Battle and the Dragon Beast's projection, both were extremely strong.

The Demon Race's betrayal had caused a sudden reversal in power, and if Su Yu hadn't acted crazily and killed Marquis Ziyun, they might not have had any advantage at all.

At this moment, both sides were somewhat at a stalemate. Tiangu looked at Su Yu, "Should we break the formation and charge in?"

He actually asked Su Yu!

And Su Yu laughed, baring his teeth, "No rush, wait a moment!"

Why?

Tiangu pondered, and at this moment, a sly laugh echoed from afar.

The next moment, a voice spread, "Your Majesty, why are you in such a hurry to find me?"

"Come quickly!"

Buzz, the sound of breaking through the air!

Marquis Tongtian appeared instantly, his aura incredibly strong. Su Yu chuckled, looking at the Dragon Beast, which slightly changed its expression.

Su Yu laughed, "I've been waiting for you for a long time, I thought you weren't coming! Did you succeed in advancing?"

Marquis Tongtian chuckled, "Barely succeeded, among the Heavenly Sovereigns, I'm considered one of the weakest..."

Su Yu pointed at the Dragon Beast, "Now, with ten portals combined, if you eat it, can you become a top-tier Heavenly Sovereign?"

Marquis Tongtian looked over, drooling slightly, "This... if I don't burst, maybe... I can!"

So tempting!

Damn!

Earlier, he had only eaten four portals, and three of them were from Heavenly Kings. Now, with ten portals, four of which were from Heavenly Sovereigns, and the remaining six from Heavenly Kings.

Eating this guy would be a fortune!

And at this moment, everyone realized that Su Yu had been waiting for Marquis Tongtian!

And the arrival of Marquis Tongtian indeed caused many to change their expressions.

He wasn't too strong, indeed, as he said, there was a sense of instability typical of someone who had just advanced, but... this guy was highly specialized in dealing with the power of portals!

The Dragon Beast was composed of the power of portals!

The key was, it also contained the Hell Gates of several Heavenly Sovereigns.

If it were truly eaten, several Heavenly Sovereigns would be injured.

Earlier, when Marquis Tongtian disappeared, they thought he wouldn't reappear for a while, but he came back quickly.

Moreover, he advanced quickly!

Under normal circumstances, it wouldn't be this fast.

However, Marquis Tongtian had gone to Su Yu's world, where there were many strong individuals, all protecting his path and suppressing the power of the portals, equivalent to a powerful logistics base, quickly suppressing his turmoil.

Advancement naturally became fast!

At this moment, Tiangu and the others also changed their expressions.

Su Yu's side now had seven Heavenly Sovereigns.

On the opposite side, counting the Dragon Beast, there were nine. On the myriad races' side, including Moon Heavenly Sovereign, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, and two ancient beasts, there were only twelve. Moreover, Moon Heavenly Sovereign was without combat power, and Dragon Heavenly Sovereign only had the strength of a Heavenly King.

Excluding these two, there were only ten, and excluding the two ancient beasts, only eight.

In almost the blink of an eye, Su Yu's side truly became an evenly matched third-party force!

This great battle left many unsure of who the enemy was. Below the Heavenly Sovereigns, the Heavenly Kings and Daofuse experts all had grim expressions.

At this point, Daofuse experts were just cannon fodder!

In this short time of battle, not many Heavenly Sovereigns and Heavenly Kings had died, but on both sides, including the ancient beasts' Daofuse experts, over a hundred had fallen!

The entire Chaos Mountain was now filled with turbulent energy, fireworks blooming, and they hadn't dissipated yet.

Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened, and he gazed at the chains of the grand formation. After a moment, he turned to Tiangu and the others, chuckling, "Do you still dare to fight?"

Tiangu replied solemnly, "Whether we dare or not... if we don't fight, and the enemy's power of laws revives, none of us will have a good end!"

Su Yu grinned, "Aren't the Immortals supposed to be the vanguard? This formation, while difficult to break, is actually quite simple if you pay a price. Your Immortal Clan... just needs to make some sacrifices, and it can be broken!"

"How do we break it?"

"Desolate Heavenly Venerable!" Su Yu laughed. "Desolate Heavenly Venerable, lift the entire mountain into the air, and the formation will break itself!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable's expression changed slightly.

"Are you referring to the mountains where the Control King's lineage resides?"

"Exactly!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable's face turned pale. This wasn't an ordinary place; it was the Land of Chaos. Each mountain here was equivalent to ten or even a hundred mountains outside, surrounded by countless peaks. Although he controlled the earth, any mishap could lead to backlash against him!

Su Yu smiled, "The enemy's power of laws will emerge soon. If we break the formation now and launch a fierce attack, we might be able to kill one or two Heavenly Venerables. If you delay... there won't be another chance!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable hesitated, but Tiangu urged, "Desolate, act! Break the formation!"

"But..."

Tiangu looked at him, his voice low, "It's just backlash and injury now. If we don't kill a few Heavenly Venerables now... it might lead to the extinction of our race!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable's eyes flickered. The next moment, he gritted his teeth and sank into the earth. In an instant, a violent wave of earth power spread through the mountains, causing cries of alarm to echo.

Inside the mountains, figures like Yue Zhan were also shaken.

Su Yu shouted, "Attack together!"

Boom!

He swung his hammer at the chains of the formation. The other Heavenly Venerables, Heavenly Kings, and Daofuse cultivators also joined in, their attacks changing the color of the sky. Yue Zhan and the others wanted to suppress Desolate Heavenly Venerable, but there was no time to intercept him.

Rumble!

Both sides were frantically breaking the formation and defending against each other.

...

Deep within the mountains.

Yuqing accelerated her emergence, growling lowly as she struggled to break free. She had indeed absorbed a lot of power from fallen experts, shortening the time needed, but it was still not enough. She needed just a bit more time to get out.

Behind the gate, ancient beings were also frantically attacking the portal, aiding Yuqing's escape. The portal trembled, but getting out was still incredibly difficult!

Yuqing's voice rang out, "If you retreat now, I won't kill you. Do the myriad races really seek death? This Su Yu has no good intentions! Both our sides are losing strength, but his side is only growing stronger!"

She tried to intimidate the myriad races into leaving. However, they ignored her.

Tiangu shouted, "Continue the assault!"

Su Yu's threat was a concern for later. For now, weakening the Control King's lineage was the priority. If they couldn't, they would have to reassess the situation. Otherwise, if the Control King's experts emerged and Su Yu's side fled, it would be even more dangerous.

"You are courting death!"

Boom!

Deep within, the portal shook violently! Yuqing was about to emerge. She was anxious! She was indeed powerful, but if Yue Zhan and the others were killed, what use was her strength? No matter how strong she was, she couldn't match so many Heavenly Venerables.

The ones who had died earlier had done so to hasten her emergence. Now, no more could die! Losing a few more would be a huge problem!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was quickly assessing the situation, sending a message, "Tongtian, make sure to consume the portal within the Brood Dragon Beast! Fat Ball, this Brood Dragon is for you and Tongtian... Giant Axe, you too! Forget it, Destiny, you go as well!"

The four said nothing.

"March, Thunderstorm, later join me. The three of us will kill Yue Hao. Thunderstorm, any objections?"

Thunderstorm replied, "I follow the Human Lord's command!"

He had no objections to killing Yue Hao.

As Su Yu continued his fierce assault, he sent a message to the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger, "Same old rules, the twins are yours. Tail-less Dragon, stop pretending. You can handle two at once. Stop acting!"

The Tail-less Dragon remained silent. Who would go all out now? They were saving their strength for the big fight!

"Tiangu, on your side, the two from the Demon Clan, Moon Luo, and the white-haired ancestor, five of you handle them! The Divine Empress and Sun Corona can handle the ancestor, and the Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether trio can handle the two from the Demon Clan! Saint Marquis, take on Moon Luo, and the white-haired one, Dao Heavenly Venerable, Origin Saint, and Tiangu, three against one. Can't kill them? Don't fight like soft persimmons. If you can't kill them now, when the power of laws emerges, there'll be no more games!"

Tiangu glanced at Su Yu. At this moment, everyone was attacking in silence. This... felt like the old days. The myriad races following the orders of the Human Race! However, now their enemy was the Control King's lineage. Tiangu remained silent for a while, then sent a message, "Alright, if we can kill, we kill. It's not that we don't want to kill, but fighting equals is not easy to decide life and death!"

"That's because you're useless!"

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to say more. Though he said that, it was also because these guys weren't fighting fiercely enough.

At this moment, the earth trembled violently. Desolate Heavenly Venerable roared, and suddenly, a giant emerged from the ground, seemingly lifting the entire world!

The earth cracked open!

The Control King's domain seemed to rise slightly. The next moment, a shrill roar echoed.

"Rise!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable roared, and everyone saw his enormous figure lifting the entire mountain territory!

Boom!

A loud explosion sounded, and in the air, the eight chains snapped instantly!

Yuqing's angry roar came, "Defend, defend with all your might!"

Do not fight! Defend with all your strength! Once she emerged, she could naturally drive away the strong enemies and even kill some.

Yue Zhan and the others had no interest in fighting. They focused on defense, forming a circle to resist the onslaught from Su Yu's group as the formation shattered!

"Grouping up?"

Seeing them group up for defense, Su Yu knew this kind of defense was indeed hard to break! But... the next moment, Su Yu shouted, "Everyone, head to the Gate of Hell and kill that woman!"

A group of people flew madly towards the Gate of Hell. Yue Zhan had no choice but to shout, "Stop them!"

At this moment, they had to scatter! Su Yu, that beast, never did anything good!

"Kill!"

Scattering was good! As they dispersed, they quickly began fighting according to Su Yu's plan!

Su Yu, along with Thunderstorm and March, charged straight at Yue Hao.

Yue Hao's expression changed!

He looked at Su Yu, and Su Yu looked back, smiling, "You killed my people. If I don't kill you, it would be a disservice!"

Yue Hao said nothing! It was just a matter of being outmatched! If Su Yu were weak, his people would naturally have been killed.

Yue Hao glanced back at the Gate of Hell, sighed with some resignation, and then looked at Su Yu. At this moment, controlling the ancient beast's body, he looked at Su Yu and sighed, "You... won't have a good end! When the Gate of Hell fully opens, it will be your death! You won't wait for the Human Emperor or the Culture King..."

Because the Gate of Hell would be the first to open! Chaos was about to return!

"You probably won't see it!"

At this moment, Su Yu stopped swinging his hammer. Without showing some real skills, it wouldn't be easy to quickly kill a Heavenly Venerable. The three of them could kill him, but not quickly.

"The four corners of the world are mine!"

A whisper, and Yue Hao suddenly found all sounds around him disappearing, as if he had entered a new world!

This wasn't Su Yu's world, but a projection of the world!

"I command the civilization of the cosmos!"

Su Yu's grand voice echoed, "March, I grant you the path of a hundred attacks, kill him!"

In the world, March's figure appeared, and in an instant, his aura surged. His mind went blank, as if he had mastered a hundred paths in the blink of an eye. Roaring, his body expanded a million times, and he swung a bamboo at Yue Hao!

"Thunderstorm, I grant you the true method of ten thousand thunders, kill!"

Thunderstorm also became incredibly powerful in an instant, unleashing a burst of thunder power, boom!

"Trap!"

"Suppress!"

"Lock!"

"Seal!"

"Town!"

"..."

One word after another emerged, each voice like a great bell, shaking Yue Hao's eardrums, leaving him utterly shocked.

"Time stands still for me!"

A light laugh, and in the small world, time seemed to stop flowing, different from the outside world!

At this moment, Su Yu finally showed his true skills!

And Yue Hao, suppressed by the power of countless great paths, roared madly, struggling fiercely, but as his strength waned, March and Thunderstorm grew stronger by at least thirty percent!

In Thunderstorm's ears, Su Yu's voice echoed, "If you still hold back, I'll kill you right here. Give it your all and kill him!"

Thunderstorm's heart trembled violently. What was this? Where were they? However... he dared not hold back any longer. In an instant, a powerful thunder force struck Yue Hao, and boom, Yue Hao's ancient beast body exploded. Su Yu did not intervene; he was suppressing Yue Hao, empowering the two strong fighters!

"Misfortune gathers!"

With Su Yu's low shout, just as Yue Hao was about to retreat, boom, he seemed to step into thin air. In truth, he was stepping on air, so how could he step into nothing?

But at that moment, he did step into nothing, stumbled, and was struck by March's bamboo, with a bang, rolling and crawling, yet still having half his body blown apart by March's bamboo.

Despair filled Yue Hao's face!

"Where is this? Su Yu... what have you done to me?"

No matter how weak he was, he shouldn't have been killed instantly, but here, he felt time was frozen, the whole world was against him, and suppression forces were attacking from all sides!

Now, even walking, he could step into nothing. This misfortune was unparalleled!

Boom!

Thunderstorm's thunder power descended, blasting him into a rolling mess.

Yue Hao struggled fiercely, but at that moment, countless chains emerged from all directions, instantly binding him. Despite his frantic attempts to break free, March and Thunderstorm accelerated their attacks by thirty percent, closing in on him in the blink of an eye!

Boom!

The deafening sound echoed as Yue Hao's ancient beast body was utterly shattered!

Both Thunderstorm and March were taken aback!

March understood the situation but was experiencing for the first time what it was like to fight within Su Yu's world. It was astonishing!

This wasn't even the real world, just a projection of Su Yu's Great Dao!

Yet here, Yue Hao had no power to retaliate!

"Yue Hao, the debt you owe for killing my people must be repaid!" Su Yu's voice rang out.

March wanted to curse. Really? You're taking this seriously? None of those people you claim died actually did!

"Kill!"

Su Yu's fierce shout snapped March back to reality, prompting him to swiftly attack Yue Hao. Yue Hao, however, was sinking deeper into despair.

He had hoped to stall for time, to wait for Yu Qing to arrive!

But... he realized that no matter how much he delayed, it was useless. He was going to die!

"Su Yu..." Yue Hao let out a bitter, mocking laugh. "Do you think you can win? You're wrong. You can't win! Not even the Human Emperor could win if he returned! The Chaos will return, the Era of Opening the Heavens will return, and one by one, the peerless experts will return... You cannot win! I'll be waiting for you. Even in death, I'll find your subordinates and kill them again!"

"Sorry, they're still alive. Fooled you, my apologies..."

Yue Hao's eyes widened in shock!

In the next moment, Su Yu suddenly appeared. March struck with a bamboo, Thunderstorm unleashed a thunderous attack, and Su Yu smashed down with a hammer!

Boom!

The loud explosion reverberated through the heavens and earth, and Yue Hao's sea of will instantly shattered, disintegrating into nothingness. Within his sea of will, waves surged with resentment, anger, and unwillingness!

Were they really not dead?

He couldn't believe it!

At this moment, he wanted to hear that those people were dead, not that they were all still alive!

Su Yu looked at the remnants of his will with indifference, waved his hand, and instantly shattered it, sneering, "What are you fighting me for? If I want to play you to death, it's too easy!"

Boom!

The world collapsed!

In an instant, the three of them reappeared, and the battle... had just begun!

The power attached to Thunderstorm's body instantly dissipated, making him feel significantly weaker. It was just an illusion; the power Su Yu had just granted him had completely vanished.

At this moment, Thunderstorm's eyes were filled with horror.

He understood!

He seemed to have realized something!

The world!

Su Yu... had opened a new world!

He looked at Su Yu in shock. Why... why tell me this?

Am I going to die?

Yes!

Su Yu... might kill him!

Why did he want me to act with him, why?

Thunderstorm's heart was filled with boundless fear!

This was an opener of the heavens, he was actually an opener of the heavens!

And at this moment, all around, the strong ones hadn't even engaged in battle yet, but suddenly, there was a violent tremor, causing the entire Kingdom of the Control King to shake violently!

Over there, Yue Zhan, Yue Luo, and the others were all stunned. Yue Hao... was killed?

They had just made contact!

Just after contact, Yue Hao was killed!

Everyone was incredibly shocked and terrified. The three Heavenly Venerables were strong, but Yue Hao, no matter how weak, shouldn't have been instantly killed by Su Yu upon contact!

They had only seen a sudden darkness over there, and then... Yue Hao was dead!

It was terrifying!

Su Yu, once again Su Yu!

Today's Heavenly Venerables were almost all killed by Su Yu!

Sword Servant self-destructed because of him, Dou He had his body destroyed by Tiangu and others, but it was Su Yu who shattered his sea of will. He also killed Marquis Ziyun, and now, he killed Yue Hao!

At this moment, even the myriad races were horrified!

Could they really match Su Yu's side after defeating the Control King's lineage?

Thunderstorm and Destiny, on Su Yu's side, were incredibly obedient. Were they truly following the orders of the myriad races, or had they long since defected to Su Yu?

Deep within, even Yu Qing was slightly shaken. She had one foot out of the portal, half her body almost out, but now, because of Yue Hao's death, she was greatly shocked. He died too quickly!
