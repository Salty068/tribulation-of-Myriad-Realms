Chapter 861: Slaying the Emperor! (Please Subscribe)

Whether the opportunity exists or not is uncertain at this moment. However, the Myriad Races have made some preparations, and perhaps it will manifest.

At this moment, the Divine Emperor continued to charge toward Su Yu, while the Immortal Emperor remained out of the battle, and the Demon Emperor also headed straight for Su Yu... intending to deal with the few second-tier experts around him.

The four first-tier powerhouses of the Dragon, Phoenix, Nether, and Spirit races were present. This time, the Radiant King did not face two opponents alone. The Myriad Races had adjusted their strategy, with the Spirit Emperor, skilled in Dao techniques, confronting the Radiant King.

The Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Emperor were respectively dealing with the Martial King and the Consort of the Radiant King. The Nether Emperor was severely injured, entangling several second-tier experts at this time.

On the Myriad Races' side, the Immortal Emperor still refrained from taking action, focusing on healing the injured.

To the other Myriad Races, this attack seemed no different from previous ones. It appeared to be another instance where a group would get injured, and then Su Yu would retreat. This scene had repeated many times, with nothing particularly special about it.

...

"Su Yu!"

The Divine Emperor's face was cold as he looked at Su Yu, throwing a punch that unleashed divine power. Such battles had occurred many times, with neither side having a significant advantage, making it difficult for even first-tier experts to get injured.

"You are too arrogant!"

The Divine Emperor's face was cold as he surveyed the surroundings. At this moment, most of the remaining people were Su Yu's. If Su Yu were to die, the human side would instantly collapse, and not only would Su Yu's group perish, but everyone else would be doomed as well.

The Divine Emperor hadn't expected that the core of this battle, or rather the core of the long-standing confrontation between the humans and the Myriad Races, had now completely shifted to Su Yu.

Most of the Human Emperor's people were severely injured, and surprisingly, most of those still capable of fighting were Su Yu's people.

The clearer the situation became, the more tempted the Divine Emperor felt.

Not far away, the Demon Emperor was also incredibly powerful, fighting multiple second-tier experts alone. The Yue King, Book Spirit, Great Zhou King, and Martial Emperor joined forces against this top-tier expert, only managing to fight to a standstill.

Seeing the situation, Su Yu immediately realized that the Myriad Races had a plan.

No wonder, they had arranged for the Spirit Emperor to deal with the Radiant King!

This was different!

Previously, dealing with the Radiant King always involved two first-tier experts, with the Dragon and Phoenix Emperors constantly battling the Radiant King. The Myriad Races had plenty of second-tier experts, and they used to pair them with the injured Nether Emperor to handle the Martial King or the Consort of the Radiant King.

This way, the Myriad Races wouldn't make mistakes, could block the humans on all fronts, and even gain some advantages. If the Immortal Emperor joined, the advantage would be even greater!

But now, they were taking a risk!

The Spirit Emperor was dealing with the Radiant King!

Clearly, it was an unfavorable matchup.

However, in this setting, it could hold.

With this lineup, Su Yu understood that the Myriad Races had truly taken the bait. They intended to kill him, with the Divine, Demon, and Immortal Emperors planning to join forces to kill him!

They thought highly of Su Yu!

The three strongest, with the Demon Emperor nearby, the Immortal Emperor not taking action but certainly prepared.

This was exciting, wasn't it?

Su Yu thought to himself.

He said nothing, only coldly and relentlessly attacked the Divine Emperor with punches and kicks.

His powerful strength shook the heavens and swept across the land.

He was assessing, assessing what the Myriad Races would think at the moment when the Human Emperor severed his path.

In fact, the best approach would be to find a way to sever Su Yu's connection to the heavens at that moment.

As long as Su Yu's connection to the heavens was severed, it would be easier to kill him, and the combat power of others would decline.

Battle!

Continuous battle!

Both sides were actually very tired, but this time, Su Yu wasn't in a hurry to retreat, and neither were the Myriad Races. They were also adapting, constantly seeking opportunities.

...

At the back of the crowd.

The Immortal Emperor's life force continued to spread, extending to some injured rulers of laws, his eyes flickering.

He was preparing!

If they could kill Su Yu, the Myriad Races would surely win this battle, and it would be a great victory!

At that time, although many would have died, others wouldn't care.

If they could crush the humans, who would care about the dead?

But if they couldn't crush the humans, if something went wrong and they failed to kill Su Yu... if they ended up killing the strong on the Myriad Races' side, he might find it hard to shirk responsibility.

However, the Immortal Emperor didn't care anymore.

If they truly took a risky gamble and failed, it would mean the Myriad Races might lose the war, and whether he bore responsibility or not wouldn't make much difference.

He continued to radiate brilliance, entering the bodies of those around him.

Some felt uncomfortable, sensing their injuries were almost healed, and someone hurriedly said, "Immortal Emperor, no need to heal me anymore, don't waste the power of laws, I can recover with some rest..."

If you keep healing, I'll be fully recovered, and that wouldn't be appropriate!

The Immortal Emperor calmly said, "No problem! If everyone's injuries can heal, we can gain an advantage and deliver a heavy blow to the enemy while we're fully recovered!"

He understood everyone's thoughts and transmitted, "Continuing like this isn't a solution. Even if injured, that lunatic Su Yu will keep pestering us! The best solution is still to kill Su Yu!"

The crowd was slightly moved. We know, but... it's very difficult.

The Immortal Emperor continued, "I will pay the price to quickly heal everyone's injuries... when Su Yu is unprepared, are you willing to deliver a thunderous strike and kill Su Yu? If he dies, we will surely win this battle!"

The eyes of the injured experts flickered, and someone transmitted, "Can we really recover instantly?"

"Yes!"

The Immortal Emperor transmitted, "It's nothing more than paying a price. At worst, I'll learn from the Nether Emperor and pay the price of nearly severing my path to help you recover!"

He could indeed do it.

Of course, the price was enormous.

But if these injured experts truly recovered, they might not even need to kill them; they could kill Su Yu, using hidden means as a last resort.

A group of people looked at each other, tempted for a moment.

"What consequences are there?"

Instant recovery, what price do we need to pay?

"You? You don't need to pay much, of course... your Dao must open a gap to my Dao, allowing me to directly infuse life force into your Dao, only then can you recover quickly!"

The crowd thought for a moment, finding it reasonable. Otherwise, without treating the Dao injuries, physical injuries wouldn't be difficult.

They exchanged glances, dozens of them.

At this moment, they didn't think too much.

Even if they were wary of each other, the Immortal Emperor was one of the leaders of the Myriad Races, and there seemed to be no need to harm them.

After some consideration, they all agreed.

"If we can kill Su Yu, that would be best! This guy has killed many of our comrades since he arrived, and he's truly troublesome!"

Everyone was still very annoyed with Su Yu. The Human Emperor hadn't launched a full-scale war for many years.

But Su Yu, fighting day and night, wouldn't let anyone have peace!

The crowd began to open the gap in their Dao, and the Immortal Emperor's Dao began to spread like a tree, branching out, infusing life force bit by bit, transmitting, "Everyone, be careful, act only when necessary, continue to disguise, don't reveal anything."

The crowd understood, restraining their aura, maintaining their original state.

...

Both sides harbored ulterior motives.

At this moment, all that was needed was a change in the heavens.

And Su Yu, after stalling with the Divine Emperor for a while, saw that the situation was largely set, and the power of the heavens slightly fluctuated.

It could begin!

Human Emperor, it's up to you now.

The greater the commotion, the more delighted the Myriad Races would be. Opportunities are for those who are prepared.

...

Myriad Realms.

Lantian's eyes suddenly moved, quickly shouting, "Your Majesty, it's time to begin!"

The Human Emperor's eyes flickered.

It's time?

Su Yu, this guy, is really impatient!

He took a deep breath, and in the next moment, his shadow dissipated, revealing his true self in the sea of will. Everyone looked and was shocked, seeing it shattered and tattered, like a large sphere, but already broken and ragged.

The ocean in the sea of will surged, constantly spilling out willpower, the sea turbulent, the heavens trembling.

"Your Majesty..."

Behind him, the injured Human Kings' faces changed.

Is His Majesty so severely injured?

For so many years, has he been dealing with enemies in this state?

The entire sea of will was extremely damaged.

Even so, he had previously used the power of the sea of will to deal with three first-tier experts.

The Human Emperor ignored them. At this moment, the power of the Dao was drawn.

If the Heaven Gate were opened, one could see a golden Dao gradually appearing from the void, incomparably powerful, even vaguely comparable to the human race's physical Dao.

That was his Dao, the Human Emperor's Dao!

What exactly is the Human Emperor's Dao? Perhaps it's responsibility, perhaps it's protection, perhaps it's enlightenment.

The Human Emperor's duty lies in these.

To bear the responsibility of the human race, to protect the people, to enlighten the people, to open their minds, to strengthen the race, to strengthen the people.

This Dao shone with golden light.

If the Heaven Gate were opened, it would surely be dazzling.

At this moment, the Human Emperor connected with the Human Emperor's Dao, his aura turbulent, the sea of will even more shattered. Before merging into the heavens, he must sever the Dao and then merge into the heavens!

Otherwise, bringing the Dao directly into the heavens would burst his sea of will.

The Human Emperor looked up at the power of the Dao, his eyes complex.

Sever the Dao!

He opened the heavens at his peak, but at that time, the heavens he opened were not as strong as the Dao, so he didn't choose to merge the Dao into the heavens then, as it would have been too disruptive and detrimental to opening the heavens.

Today, he must merge the Dao!

The Human Emperor's aura grew stronger!

The sea of will violently fluctuated, and the entire Myriad Realms seemed to hear the sound of waves, the sound of the sea of will shaking, the sound of powerful willpower sweeping the heavens.

The Human Emperor took step after step toward his own heavens, and in the distance, that small heaven also trembled, as if welcoming its master's return.

Sever the Dao!

At this moment, the Human Emperor hesitated, because he knew that the moment he severed the Dao would be the moment Su Yu erupted.

He hesitated!

He truly hesitated!

I continuously spoke, and the Myriad Races would still be wary. No matter how many plans they had, they wouldn't dare to act against Su Yu. Once his fake shadow appeared, even with all the preparations the Immortal Emperor had made, they would likely hesitate and not dare to act rashly.

He hesitated!

For the first time in many years, he hesitated.

If Su Yu were to fall, it would be catastrophic. Over thirty rulers of laws on that side, not to mention the twenty or so under his command, totaling more than fifty rulers of laws, might all perish.

Should he take the gamble?

Gamble the lives of over fifty rulers of laws on the chance that Su Yu would be fine?

He hesitated, and Lantian seemed to understand. In a deep voice, he said, "Your Majesty, the Human Emperor, Emperor Yu requests the Human Emperor to sever the Dao and open the heavens!"

The Human Emperor suddenly looked at him, speaking solemnly, "You know!"

Lantian was solemn, "I know! But I believe! No matter how great the crisis, we have faced it before, countless times between life and death. I think, for Your Majesty, this is just a small hurdle. Your Majesty will surely prevail!"

The Human Emperor took a deep breath, "Alright, I believe in him!"

In the end, he chose to trust.

The Human Emperor gave a low shout, "Remember, once I succeed, immediately merge with the Dao. After merging, quickly recuperate and follow me... to the front lines!"

"Understood!"

Many Human Lords shouted in unison!

At this moment, a murderous aura spread across the world, causing the Myriad Realms to tremble. Even if injured, they were still Human Lords, not to mention the Human Emperor's might, which shook the world!

The Human Emperor looked up at the sky and declared loudly, "Today, I sever the Dao to open the heavens, the heavens of the Human Race! The heavens of responsibility! The heavens of protection! The heavens of enlightenment! All humans may enter my world, recreate the heavens and earth, replay the universe! My heart is steadfast, and the heavens shall take responsibility, protection, and enlightenment as their duty! If one day, my heart changes, these heavens shall perish, and my Xingyu shall be abandoned by the Human Race!"

Majestic heavenly might!

Words spoken become law; this is the Human Emperor's heaven, the first rule!

If I change, then let these heavens perish, abandon me!

Everyone's expressions changed.

Yet the Human Emperor laughed heartily, feeling incredibly free, "I am the Human Emperor, the Emperor of the Human Race, Su Yu... is nothing!"

"......"

Lantian and the others were speechless. Every person fighting to the death liked to curse Su Yu a bit.

Enemies did so, allies did so, friends did so, and even allies did so...

The Human Emperor didn't care about this, laughing and cursing. The next moment, he roared, "Sever!"

A loud shout echoed through the heavens and earth!

A golden great Dao suddenly shattered with a boom.

At this moment, the entire River of Time shook violently because the Human Emperor's Dao was too strong. Severing the Dao was essentially seizing control of the River of Time, even seizing its source.

Rumble!

The entire River of Time shook at this moment, not just the Myriad Realms, but upstream, downstream, and even within the Three Gates, all were shaking!

At this moment, in the distance, within the Earth Gate, several figures suddenly appeared. The next moment, eyes appeared from within the Earth Gate...

As soon as the eyes appeared, the Human Emperor, in the midst of severing the Dao, suddenly had a gaze as cold as ice.

Seizing the moment of severing the Dao, he suddenly punched out!

This punch, golden light flickering, illuminated the heavens and earth!

Boom!

A punch struck the Gate of Hell. At this moment, the Gate of Hell seemed to awaken slightly, suddenly opening a small gap, avoiding this punch in an instant. But this punch directly entered the Gate of Hell!

Boom!

A shrill scream erupted instantly, rumbling!

The Gate of Hell seemed to be pierced through. Under the shocked gazes of everyone, they saw, saw three or four rulers of laws within the gate, directly shattered into pieces by this punch!

The Human Emperor's voice shook the heavens and earth, no longer gentle, carrying majestic heavenly might, cold and boundless, shaking the Gate of Hell, "I allow you to come out, you can come out. If not... coming out means death! Whether it's the Lord of Chaos, the Control King, or the Human Ancestor, dare to come out, I'll slaughter you!"

The grand voice swept across the entire Gate of Hell!

At this moment, the Gate of Hell instantly fell silent.

The might of that punch, after killing several rulers of laws, swept across the entire heavens and earth. Within the Gate of Hell, countless powerful beings saw that golden giant fist, sweeping across the heavens and earth!

Unparalleled in strength!

...

At this moment, within the Gate of Hell.

In some dark places, they all saw that punch, heard that incomparably majestic, heaven-suppressing cold voice.

"Human Emperor!"

"It's the Human Emperor!"

"It's him!"

"He's back?"

"He actually came back!"

"Heavens, is he going to break in?"

"......"

The Gate of Hell, once opened in ancient times, but eventually closed again.

Because... in that era, there was the Human Emperor, there was the Culture King!

At this moment, the entire Gate of Hell was trembling. This modern era's strongest, today, his divine might covered the heavens and earth!

With one punch, even the Gate of Hell yielded to him.

Terrifying beyond measure!

At this moment, deep within the Gate of Hell, several figures appeared, looming, with a voice echoing, "He's back!"

"The Three Gates haven't opened... he came back, it seems someone upstream is still blocking!"

"Let people retreat, don't linger near the Gate of Hell... until the Three Gates are fully opened, don't approach again!"

"......"

One grand voice after another echoed.

And at this moment, another shadow that covered the sky appeared, carrying a sense of antiquity, an ancient voice echoed, "Xingyu, the portal is not open, I can't go out, you can't come in, no need to be hostile at this moment..."

The Human Emperor's grand voice came from afar, like a voice from beyond the heavens, carrying indifference, carrying coldness, "Lord of Chaos? The past is past, do you still want to turn the tables? In your era, you couldn't defy the heavens, let alone in this era that belongs to us! If you dare to come out, I will kill you, you crawling thing, dare to be presumptuous again, once the Three Gates open, I will be the first to destroy your chaotic era!"

The Human Emperor was arrogant beyond measure, domineering beyond measure. At this moment, the might of the Human Emperor suppressed one of the Three Gates, the Earth Gate!

"Don't blame me for not warning you, dare to provoke again, break the Earth Gate, slaughter your chaotic era, scram!"

A loud shout made countless Chaos Ancient Clan members tremble with fear.

Countless strong beings fled from near the Gate of Hell.

The Human Emperor!

The number one under the heavens!

Of course, the Culture King also had this title, but no one cared about these now, only fear!

Inside the gate, they couldn't even stop the Human Emperor from killing, it was too terrifying!

Inside the gate, there were also top-tier peerless strong beings. At this moment, some were silent, some snorted coldly, some sneered, some remained silent.

The Human Emperor has returned!

He is not Su Yu, he is a strong being who suppressed an era, a strong being who suppressed countless people. He had dealings with the Earth Gate. In ancient times, countless strong beings walked out from the Gate of Hell, all were killed on the spot by these powerful existences.

They even held bonfire parties outside the gate, roasting Chaos Ancient Clan members, the aroma wafting through the chaotic era.

That terrifying person, he has returned, after disappearing for countless years, his reappearance is so terrifying.

...

At this moment, Tiangu and the others hiding in the shadows, all turned pale.

The Human Emperor has returned!

Tiangu and these people, whether they were from the Human Emperor's era or not, who didn't know the Human Emperor's might?

Perhaps they didn't know before, but today they were shocked.

The strong beings within the Earth Gate recognized him!

Moreover, they feared him!

This is the most terrifying part, the Human Emperor even intimidated the existences within the Earth Gate back then.

...

Further away.

Zhou Ji looked up at the sky, as if seeing the shadow of the Human Emperor, and sighed lightly, "Truly strong!"

But, there were some problems.

What problems?

Zhou Ji fell into contemplation.

At this moment, the Human Emperor was unbelievably strong, the heavens and earth trembled, that tremor... why did it tremble?

Under the Human Emperor's punch, it did cover up these tremors, but initially, it was indeed the world trembling, which led to the Human Emperor's punch... Zhou Ji fell into contemplation, murmuring; "Could it be the last punch of his life?"

Hard to say!

But, a punch that made the Earth Gate choose to temporarily revive, choose to avoid this strike, that's a bit absurd!

If the Human Emperor was truly this powerful, he would have broken the Earth Gate long ago, directly killing his way in!

Why wait until now?

...

At this moment, Lantian and the others were also all pale with fright.

And the Gate of Hell also instantly sealed, directly closed, hidden into the void.

The Human Emperor stood for a moment, the next moment, like a fire burning his tail, no longer as domineering as before, his sea of willpower frantically fluctuating, the power of the great Dao spilling over, he dove into his own world, his voice urgent and sharp, "Quick, merge with the world, merge with the Dao... ah, I'm going to die..."

"......"

Stunned!

Lantian and the others were all stunned, the Human Emperor... seemed really about to die, not faking it.

Suddenly, Lantian and the others couldn't care about the scene just now.

At that moment, the Human Emperor was too majestic, too strong, too shocking.

A punch that made one of the Three Gates, the Earth Gate, retreat!

Made the ancient existences within the Earth Gate dare not speak.

At that moment, they were all in a daze, truly thinking the Human Emperor was number one under the heavens, invincible, suppressing all ages, but at this moment... the fantasy shattered, everyone understood, they thought too much, it was just the moment of severing the Dao, the Human Emperor's great Dao erupted with unprecedented power, which led to that unforgettable scene!

The reality is, if the Human Emperor fails to merge with the world, he will surely die!

King Ping and the others were also anxious, shouting angrily, "Quick, merge with the Dao... first merge with the Dao of Peace, suppress the world, others don't rush to merge..."

One by one, the strong beings quickly dove into the world.

That punch just now, everyone still couldn't forget, but... reality is a bit more important, that scene just now, leave it for later to boast about, didn't you see the Human Emperor didn't even have time to boast?

On a normal day, the Human Emperor would have started boasting long ago, I suppressed the Three Gates with one punch!

At this moment, the entire River of Time shook violently.

...

At the same time.

Whether it's the Heaven Gate or the Human Gate, they all trembled slightly.

An absolute peerless strong being, severing the great Dao, the ripple it caused, was unimaginably powerful!

...

Upstream.

Su Yu and his companions were locked in battle when suddenly, the river began to churn violently. In that instant, a golden light swept across the heavens and earth, and the river surged with towering waves. Under the shocked gazes of all present, a powerful and unparalleled Dao emerged from the river—a golden Dao!

At the same time, in the distance, a shadow that had been disguising itself suddenly collapsed. The Human Emperor's shadow crumbled. Accompanying this was the abrupt shattering of the golden Dao!

The Immortal Emperor and his companions widened their eyes in disbelief, shock, and fear, overwhelmed by a myriad of emotions. Had the Human Emperor fallen? Had his Dao collapsed? The shadow had dissipated—was this the end of the Dao?

The Human Emperor, who had dominated the world for countless ages, had he truly fallen? Or was he severing his Dao in a bid for survival? As these thoughts surfaced, they realized they could no longer afford to ponder. Whether the Human Emperor was dead or attempting to sever his Dao for recovery, they had to act now!

Kill Su Yu!

Moreover, the shadows of other severely injured human experts also dissipated. At this moment, the top experts vaguely understood that the Human Emperor and his allies were fighting for survival. They were trying to find a way to restore the Human Emperor. This could not be allowed!

At that moment, the Immortal Emperor suddenly roared, his Life Dao trembling violently. An immense life force surged into the bodies of the injured experts. The Immortal Emperor visibly aged, his aura weakening drastically, yet his eyes were bright as he bellowed, "The Human Emperor is dead! Kill! Annihilate the human race!"

The Human Emperor was dead!

Before him stood over thirty experts, all previously wounded. Now, they were instantly restored. Even if only temporarily, their strength returned, and they roared with excitement, fear, and complex emotions, as if to bolster their courage, shouting, "The Human Emperor is dead! Kill!"

They charged towards Su Yu!

As long as they killed Su Yu, the battle would be over.

This was an opportunity!

A heaven-sent opportunity!

At this moment, the Radiant King and his allies turned pale. They knew the Human Emperor was severing his Dao to merge with the heavens, but they hadn't anticipated that the Immortal Emperor would have such a method, seemingly self-destructive, severing most of his own Dao to restore all the severely injured experts.

Over thirty of them!

So many experts restored, all charging at Su Yu. Su Yu... was doomed!

The Radiant King and his allies turned pale. They knew the Human Emperor wasn't dead, but Su Yu was on the brink of death.

If Su Yu died, it would all be over!

The Radiant King was about to act when he suddenly remembered Su Yu's previous words: even if he died, remember one thing—kill the enemy, kill the enemy!

The Radiant King saw his companions about to fly towards Su Yu and suddenly roared, "Hold the line! Kill! Kill! Kill!"

In an instant, he unleashed his full combat power, madly conjuring killing arrays, attacking the Spirit Emperor.

Over there, the Martial Suppression King and the Radiant Queen also shouted fiercely, their killing intent shaking the heavens!

"Kill!"

Opposite them, the myriad races' experts were equally excited, roaring, "Kill! Annihilate the human race! We will win this battle!"

To the myriad races, this opportunity was practically divine intervention!

At this critical moment, the Human Emperor was gone, the severely injured human experts were gone, while their own severely injured experts were restored. If they didn't fight now, when would they?

Opportunity!

The chance had come!

The over thirty previously injured experts charged at Su Yu, and the Divine Emperor let out a fierce roar, going all out, his divine power exploding, overwhelmingly suppressing Su Yu!

Entangle Su Yu, for if he escaped, it would be troublesome.

The Divine Emperor couldn't hide his joy, and beside him, the Demon Emperor, ignoring everything else, swept King Yue aside with a spear, madly charging towards Su Yu. Killing Su Yu would end this battle!

Or rather, it could end the war across the myriad realms!

How could they not go mad?

Yet Su Yu's face was filled with despair as he roared, "Kill! Kill one and it's worth it! Kill them all!"

The Divine Emperor ignored this!

The Demon Emperor and the Immortal Emperor ignored it too.

Let them kill!

As long as they could kill Su Yu, even if they lost a dozen or twenty rulers of laws, what did it matter?

"You can't escape!"

At this moment, the Divine Emperor's massive fist swept across the heavens, a clone emerging to entangle Su Yu. Even if it cost him, he would bind Su Yu, waiting for the others to arrive. Su Yu was doomed!

Over thirty experts, joining forces—Su Yu's survival was impossible!

Even the Human Emperor couldn't stop them!

At this moment, Su Yu let out a fierce roar, unleashing his full combat power, his aura turbulent, as if ready to fight to the death. A long blade erupted with countless Dao forces, slashing towards the Divine Emperor!

"Demon Emperor!"

The Divine Emperor roared, and the Demon Emperor also went all out, roaring as he thrust his spear at Su Yu!

At this moment, behind the Demon Emperor, the Great Zhou King's aura fluctuated, as did King Yue's and the Book Spirit's.

Over thirty experts suddenly restored—perhaps even Su Yu hadn't anticipated this.

He hadn't expected that the Immortal Emperor wouldn't come in person but had such a heaven-defying method.

Some of Su Yu's previous arrangements might need to change.

Yet Su Yu was insanely calm, quickly communicating with the Heaven Gate, his voice slightly urgent, "Gui, I'm about to die. Quickly, help me kill the enemy..."

"Has the fight started?"

Gui's clone seemed to sense the world's tremors. Behind the gate, Gui's eyes lit up as he looked at his companions, quickly saying, "I need to descend in person. Everyone... wait a while. Once I capture Su Yu, this myriad realms will be ours!"

Gui was overjoyed, "Rest assured, I can't contend with those supreme beings alone. Only by joining forces can we hope to resist them before they descend, to dominate a region, rather than living in the myriad realms in hiding..."

The others were excited and thrilled, all saying, "Descend quickly, we trust you, Brother Gui!"

Gui was right. Alone, even if he merged with the myriad realms' Dao, he couldn't resist those supreme beings.

Only by joining forces could they hope!

So they weren't worried about Gui reneging; it was only a matter of time before he would bring them all over!

"Hahaha, good!"

Gui's true form instantly squeezed through the gate, enduring some pain, but compared to descending into the myriad realms, he felt it was all worth it.

In an instant, Gui squeezed through.

The others behind him were filled with envy.

"Su Yu is such an idiot, actually letting Gui descend in person..."

"He'll surely gain countless benefits... so envious!"

"Exactly, he'll definitely capture countless physical Dao experts, seizing their physical Dao power. Perhaps... by the time we descend, he could surpass the power of 20 Daos!"

"More than that, I think he could reach 25 Daos!"

"Ah, envy, it's a pity Su Yu didn't choose us first!"

Among the experts, some were of the same level as Gui.

At this moment, their eyes were green with envy.

The first to descend would gain too many benefits!

Gui could slaughter countless physical Dao experts, seize their Daos, even invade the human race's physical Dao, rapidly advancing, merging yin and yang, strengthening himself. By the time others descended, if Gui were ruthless and killed everyone, stripping them of their power of laws... everyone would have to look to him!

How could they not be envious?

...

And Gui, at this moment, was endlessly excited.

He felt it, felt the different power of the world.

He was overjoyed, also sensing a massive force approaching from afar. He was now outside the Heaven Gate, within Su Yu's control range, but he could instantly descend to the imprint location.

A pulling force followed!

Su Yu's voice came, "Kill!"

Gui was ecstatic, following the pulling force, instantly appearing before Su Yu. He knew this was Su Yu reaching his imprint location, though it felt... unfamiliar?

Gui appeared, feeling something strange.

No, this wasn't right!

Last time, my clone didn't appear here, my imprint location hasn't moved!

Where is this?

It seemed to be above a great river!

What river?

Strange!

He had no time to look, no time to think, because he felt the overwhelming force coming at him. He heard Su Yu's maniacal laughter, "Hahaha, did you think you had me figured out? My trump card is beyond your imagination!"

Gui's heart stirred. Was he talking about me?

Indeed, I am your greatest trump card, a first-tier expert!

Moreover, I am the true form!

Surprised?

And the Divine Emperor and Demon Emperor attacking him both changed their expressions. A first-tier?

Su Yu still had a first-tier hidden!

The two great experts roared, their battle power erupting to the extreme. Su Yu and the newcomer were both first-tier, which was troublesome. They had to entangle Su Yu, as the others needed a bit more time to arrive. The battle had erupted, and they couldn't be too close to Su Yu, or they'd be caught in the aftermath.

Gui was delighted for a moment, then his expression changed drastically.

What was happening?

Such powerful forces!

He focused, and at this moment, he also threw a punch, a full-force sneak attack, but... something was wrong, two of them!

Two first-tier!

And they were both stronger than him!

How was this possible?

Not only that, but behind him, Su Yu also slashed out with a blade, that powerful force also stronger than him. Gui was momentarily dazed. Something was wrong, very wrong!

Where was he?

What was this place?

Vaguely, he even sensed many first-tier auras nearby, none weaker than him, with dozens of first-tier auras, countless second-tier, and innumerable third and fourth-tier!

There were likely over a hundred strong experts battling here!

How was this possible?

Was he dreaming?

Gui was truly horrified. No, this was completely different from what he understood!

And Su Yu's urgent voice came, "Do you want to die? Go all out, fight to the death!"

Boom!

A deafening crash echoed through the air, followed by another and another. Gui's punch landed with the force of a sledgehammer against steel, shattering his fist instantly, yet it managed to halt the Demon Emperor's spear in its tracks. His sudden appearance caught the Demon Emperor off guard, causing his hand to crack and bleed profusely. But at this point, there was no turning back; it was a fight to the death.

The Demon Emperor roared, retracting his spear and discarding it, launching a punch at Gui with murderous intent. Gui's expression changed drastically. Despite his disbelief, he was an experienced warrior and responded with a furious roar, throwing another punch. Boom! Gui's other fist shattered instantly.

Boom!

Countless forces of the Great Dao surged, and Gui's entire body exploded, blood gushing out as he opened his mouth wide in disbelief and shock. Who on earth had he encountered?

Across from him, the Demon Emperor, already severely injured by the Human Emperor, was now facing Gui's full force. Although he managed to severely wound Gui with a punch, his own arm was broken, blood spurting out as he coughed up blood continuously.

At this moment, Su Yu kicked the heavily injured Gui, sending him flying towards the Martial Emperor. This time, the Martial Emperor finally understood Su Yu's intention. He knew where Su Yu wanted him to merge his Dao—right here, with this person!

Gui was still in a daze when suddenly a fist came flying towards him. In his weakened state, this punch was lethal. In his prime, he wouldn't have feared it, but now he couldn't defend against it. He was going to die!

Why?

I just got out here!

I came to sweep the world!

Why?

Su Yu... deceived me!

"If you want to live, sever your Great Dao quickly and cooperate with the Martial Emperor to merge your Dao!"

Do you want to live?

Gui watched as the fist closed in on him, ready to smash his head. At this moment, he had no choice but to choose between life and death, with no time to negotiate.

I want to live!

I don't want to die!

With this thought, he instantly severed his own Great Dao. At this moment, Su Yu manipulated the world, connecting Gui to a randomly chosen unoccupied Great Dao to prevent him from dying outright.

If Gui died, Su Yu had plans for him. It wouldn't be worth it!

In his confusion, Gui merged with a Great Dao, while his physical body's Great Dao was instantly seized by the Martial Emperor. The Martial Emperor, who also possessed the Heaven Gate, could see and grasp it. He grabbed the Great Dao with a furious roar, merging it into his own, causing his aura to surge instantly!

The injured Demon Emperor, just about to retreat, suddenly changed his expression!

"Divine Emperor!"

He roared suddenly, startling the Divine Emperor, who was engaged in battle with Su Yu. What was happening?

He wanted to turn his head to look, but the pressure from Su Yu was too intense, leaving him no time to spare.

However, in the distance, the Immortal Emperor saw it and immediately opened his mouth wide in shock and fear, shouting, "Run..."

Because, silently, someone appeared behind the Demon Emperor.

At the moment when Gui and the Demon Emperor exchanged punches, that person appeared.

The Great Zhou King!

The Great Zhou King, whom he had previously shaken off, appeared silently behind him. The Great Zhou King had cultivated numerous silent Great Daos—patience, silence, slowness, concealment...

At this moment, the Great Zhou King's mastery of several Great Daos instantly reached the realm of a ruler of laws.

Multiple Great Daos merged, and in the blink of an eye, the Great Zhou King achieved first-class status.

Yet, he remained silent, without much commotion.

At the moment when Gui and the Demon Emperor were both severely injured, he emerged behind the Demon Emperor, unleashing the power of countless Great Daos to silence the Demon Emperor!

Even if it was just for an instant, it was enough!

The Great Zhou King wore a faint smile, tinged with madness. Killing a first-class expert was difficult, even when the opponent was injured. Gui was simply too afraid of death; otherwise, the Martial Emperor would have struggled to kill him.

As for the Demon Emperor, the Great Zhou King knew that if he continued to entangle with him, he could win!

But... time was running out!

Those people were coming.

At this moment, the newly enhanced power of multiple Great Daos converged. He looked at Su Yu, smiling, as if to say, "I will merge the remaining power of the Great Daos into your world. You won't refuse, will you?"

Boom!

Seven or eight Great Daos exploded instantly, right behind the Demon Emperor!

The Great Zhou King spat out a mouthful of blood, while the Demon Emperor's physical body was blown apart, his sea of willpower collapsing. Just as he was about to forcibly gather himself, the power of the Great Daos appeared around him, but he had no chance!

At this moment, behind the Great Zhou King, Yue Wang and the Book Spirit arrived. Yue Wang thrust a spear, the Book Spirit sealed the world, and the Great Zhou King tore through space...

Boom!

A thunderous explosion resounded as the three mighty experts joined forces. The severely injured and dying Demon Emperor, with a trace of unwillingness and despair, roared, "No... why... is it me?"

Why!

I don't want to die!

I am a first-class expert!

In any era, I am an invincible existence. I won't die!

After countless years of war, no first-class expert had fallen until now. At most, only second-class experts had perished. But today... he was going to die.

The fall of a first-class expert was extremely rare anywhere. After the Three Gates, only the Culture King had killed a first-class expert in recent years.

But today, first Gui had to yield, and then... the Demon Emperor, severely wounded, was slain by the combined efforts of three mighty experts!

Boom!

A massive demonic path appeared, only to be instantly shattered. With a crack, the Great Dao broke apart!

The Demon Emperor still had a trace of will, filled with unwillingness, but the Great Zhou King coldly tore it apart!

No chance was given to the Demon Emperor!

You should just die!

Boom!

The long river trembled once more, spreading out, extending to the Myriad Realms, reaching the Devil Realm. Even though there were hardly any people left in the Devil Realm, as most had been captured by Su Yu, at this moment, the Devil Realm still experienced a cataclysmic upheaval, the entire domain trembling violently!

"I... am unwilling..."

The Demon Emperor's despairing will echoed throughout the world. I am unwilling!

I have become the first first-class expert to fall in all the heavens!

Boom!

The last trace of willpower exploded instantly!

The first-class expert who had roamed the world, the emperor of the Demon Race, the ancient emperor, was slain here today!

Silence fell over the four directions!

Too shocking!

The Demon Emperor... had fallen!
