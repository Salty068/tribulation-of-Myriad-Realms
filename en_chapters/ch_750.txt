Chapter 750: Falling Like Rain

Suddenly, Su Yu's side emerged with astonishing ferocity.

Their first move was to kill!

Twenty-three top-tier experts struck in unison, instantly obliterating a Daofuse Realm expert. The opponent's Great Dao shattered, their body reduced to dust without even a moment to react.

"Courting death!"

Yue Hao was furious. These people actually dared to attack, too reckless.

But at that moment, White Dog's paw stomped down with a thunderous roar!

With a deafening crash, Yue Hao was directly stomped into the depths of the earth!

"Kill them!"

From underground, Yue Hao roared in anger. Immediately, black chains shot out, piercing through the heavens and earth, binding the Culture King's boot. Countless black chains wove through the sky.

At this moment, White Dog's Great Dao manifested, and a fierce phantom of a small white dog lunged at the chains!

"Awooo!"

The phantom white dog howled at the sky, snapping a chain with a single bite. Underground, Yue Hao was startled. What kind of Dao was this?

The Great Dao was actually being bitten apart!

Moreover, the boot was immensely powerful, exuding a formidable aura. With another struggle, it stomped down again, shattering countless chains and once more driving Yue Hao into the ground.

White Dog panted heavily, while underground, Yue Hao suddenly conjured a Hell Gate above his forehead, shouting fiercely, "Seal the world!"

A portal appeared in an instant, flying towards the boot, as if intending to swallow it whole.

Yet, the boot erupted with a powerful aura once more, stomping towards the portal with a thunderous crash.

Creak!

The boot that once stomped the West Heavenly King to death now stomped repeatedly but failed to kill Yue Hao. At this moment, it stomped on the portal, only managing to crack it.

Yue Hao spat blood, his eyes cold and fierce. The Hell Gate suddenly opened wide, and with a boom, it swallowed the entire boot!

The portal closed instantly.

Rumble!

The entire portal trembled violently, and Yue Hao, continuously spewing blood, roared as countless chains appeared in his hands, locking the portal tightly, shouting, "Seal!"

The Hell Gate, combined with the sealing Great Dao, managed to lock the Culture King's boot!

White Dog panted, slightly shocked.

The next moment, it didn't care anymore. The phantom Great Dao lunged madly at Yue Hao!

Yue Hao, while suppressing the boot, also had to deal with White Dog. As a Heavenly Sovereign-level expert, he was struggling. This dog was strong, perhaps not at the Heavenly Sovereign level alone, but with that boot, it definitely had the strength to contend with a Heavenly Sovereign!

"Yue Qin!"

Yue Hao roared, entangled by the dog, unable to break free!

Fortunately, Yue Qin was still there!

And at the moment they clashed, Su Yu's side, with seven Heavenly Kings against six Heavenly Kings and one Heavenly Sovereign, was evenly matched.

Lantian was facing Yue Qin!

Boom!

With Yue Hao's roar, as soon as they clashed, Lantian was sent flying, his body exploding!

There was still a gap between a Heavenly Sovereign and a Heavenly King.

However, the dead Lantian instantly revived, his aura slightly diminished. With a tremor, he shouted, "This is a Heavenly Sovereign!"

A second Heavenly Sovereign!

At this moment, everyone's expressions changed drastically.

A second Heavenly Sovereign-level expert!

More than expected!

Seeing this, Su Yu coldly shouted, "Director Wan, assist! Doubao, take over!"

Doubao shot out, heading towards the Heavenly King fighting Wan Tiansheng.

Wan Tiansheng also roared, transforming into multiple forms, embodying the seven emotions and six desires. Various avatars attacked, frantically mobilizing the power of the Great Dao, instantly repelling the Heavenly King and charging towards Yue Qin!

At this moment, a Heavenly King expert stood before Su Yu.

Chaos Dao!

With an incredibly robust body, the Chaos Dao was the origin of the physical path. The opponent wielded a massive axe, swinging it towards him!

Dou Kou!

Previously, he had joined forces with Yue Xi, Yue Hao's niece, to kill a strong expert of the Nether Race. Today, all four Heavenly King-level experts, Zi Shui, Dou Kou, Yue Xi, and You Zhen, were present. Besides these four Heavenly Kings, there were two more, a man and a woman, both extremely powerful.

Not just for show.

The moment Su Yu clashed with Dou Kou, he felt an overwhelming killing intent, the kind that couldn't be cultivated in seclusion.

Dou Kou's giant axe swung, and Su Yu transformed his pen into a blade, fighting him while shouting, "Shadow, quickly kill the enemy and assist!"

"Great Zhou King, give it your all!"

Su Yu roared!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King and others were shaken. An additional Heavenly Sovereign was a huge problem!

And Su Yu, with the Mark of Civilization floating in the air!

At this moment, he threw some people out, "Join forces to kill the weaker Daofuse!"

Su Yu roared again!

At this moment, multiple guardians were thrown out, all at the ninth stage of the Eternal Realm, including Xia Longwu and the Extermination King, all released by Su Yu!

As they appeared, their expressions changed.

"Seek an opportunity to fuse with the Dao!"

"Kill!"

Boom boom!

A massive explosion, over sixty top-tier experts, erupted into an intense battle on this land!

In the distance, Heavendoom and others' expressions changed.

Su Yu hadn't said to retreat!

That meant they could only fight to the death!

"Kill!"

Heavendoom swung his staff, causing a Daofuse to vomit blood instantly. Marquis Tongtian continuously teleported Daofuse experts in front of top-tier experts, who were instantly killed by several second-tier Daofuse experts!

Rumble!

Fireworks soared!

In a brief moment, including the Daofuse killed earlier, three Daofuse were killed on the spot. However, at this time, a defeat was emerging!

Doubao was no match for Zi Shui, being beaten back repeatedly.

Wan Tiansheng and Lantian, even together, couldn't match Yue Qin, as the old woman wielded Hellfire, burning their Great Dao into collapse!

This lineage was not ordinary.

Nor were they weak among Heavenly Sovereigns and Heavenly Kings.

"Kill!"

Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened, the pen dao erupted, slashing towards the opponent.

At this moment, deep within Chaos Mountain, auras rose, the Sacred Race sensed it!

They were deep inside!

Further than March and the others, but... March and the others might arrive later because they had just entered Chaos Mountain, and a large number of ancient beasts were flying towards them!

Their formation symbols hadn't been crafted yet.

At this moment, Heavenly Sovereigns without formation symbols were surrounded by those ancient beasts!

A large number of ancient beasts on the periphery were blocking the way!

This was the danger of Chaos Mountain. Without jade talismans, these people would be targeted by ancient beasts. Even if they were strong, these ancient beasts weren't weak either. They could still entangle them for a while.

"My lord!"

The Great Zhou King didn't shout Su Yu's name but roared, repelling You Zhen, clearly sensing the crisis, needing to retreat!

Quickly!

Otherwise, if the inner circle arrived first, faster than the myriad races, they would be finished!

The intelligence was wrong!

An extra Heavenly Sovereign meant they were short two Heavenly Kings, and the original advantage vanished instantly!

Not only was the advantage gone, but the key was, the two Heavenly Kings weren't as strong as the opponents.

Not only were Wan Tiansheng and the others falling behind, but White Dog was also being turned around. The boot, after all, was just an external object. Once sealed, Yue Hao turned the tables, pressing White Dog down.

Black chains wrapped around White Dog's phantom Great Dao!

Yue Hao also had the Eye of Hell, able to open his eyes to see the Great Dao!

Those chains directly locked onto White Dog's Great Dao!

White Dog was clearly struggling against the opponent. Yue Hao wasn't an ordinary Heavenly Sovereign. Even among Heavenly Sovereigns, he was top-tier, completely suppressing White Dog!

They were falling behind across the board!

No, those second-tier Daofuse experts were barely holding some advantage because everyone was quite strong.

One against two, one against three.

Back then, Old Turtle and others were also second-tier Daofuse, able to fight one against two or three. At this moment, they weren't falling behind, but if this continued, something big would happen sooner or later!

The Great Zhou King was anxious!

The intelligence was wrong, for the first time. This time, Su Yu personally scouted, resulting in an extra Heavenly Sovereign-level expert, and it was over!

Why hadn't Su Yu ordered a retreat?

If they didn't retreat soon, once entangled, they might not be able to leave!

And Su Yu, at this moment, hadn't ordered a retreat.

He and Dou Kou exchanged tens of thousands of moves in an instant. With a thunderous boom, Su Yu was struck on the head by Dou Kou's axe, a blood mark appearing on his forehead, while Su Yu also slashed the opponent's neck, blood splattering everywhere!

Dou Kou licked his lips, exuding a fierce aura, chuckling, "Little guy, you're tough enough. I'll chop you up to feed my dog!"

Boom!

The giant axe swung again.

Deep within Chaos Mountain, auras erupted. Even from a distance, Su Yu sensed the presence of Heavenly Sovereigns. He turned his head, the Heaven Gate opened, expressionless, yet he saw three super Great Daos!

Three Heavenly Sovereigns!

Yes, in that direction, three Heavenly Sovereigns were rushing over at the fastest speed.

Three Heavenly Sovereigns!

Adding the two here, there were a total of five Heavenly Sovereign-level experts.

Once the three Heavenly Sovereigns arrived, Su Yu's side might be completely wiped out.

"Very far... at least a minute..."

Su Yu thought to himself, that was quite far.

In battles between strong experts, without entanglement, life and death could often be decided in seconds.

Life and death often hung in the balance!

Just as Dou Kou advanced again, a fierce glint flashed in Su Yu's eyes. The next moment, four Daofuse experts appeared.

Heavenly Dragon Marquis, Phoenix Emperor, Kunpeng, Ape Emperor.

The four Daofuse experts appeared, eyes closed, enduring immense pain. Su Yu had been tormenting them for days, attacking their Great Daos.

The moment the four Daofuse experts appeared, boom!

A massive explosion!

The Phoenix Emperor's aura erupted, suddenly self-destructing, causing Dou Kou to stagger. That wasn't all. The next moment, the Ape Emperor and Kunpeng both exploded, leaving Dou Kou battered and bleeding!

Five Daofuse experts could contend with a Heavenly King!

The moment three Daofuse Realm experts self-detonated, the resulting explosion was no less powerful than the combined might of five Daofuse Realm experts working together. Instantly, Dou Kou was gravely injured. No one would typically use a Daofuse Realm expert as a self-destructing bomb, but for Su Yu, it didn't matter since they weren't his people.

Three bursts of fireworks ascended, and Dou Kou was severely wounded in an instant. At that moment, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis suddenly regained consciousness. His eyes flashed with a hint of surprise and a last glimmer of hope. With a roar, he transformed into his true form, and with a thunderous sound, his physical body exploded!

The explosion tore Dou Kou apart, and a portion of the Heavenly Dragon Marquis's willpower transformed into a ball of light, fleeing rapidly towards the perimeter.

Su Yu's expression changed, and he shouted, "Stop his sea of will!"

In an instant, Su Yu appeared in front of Dou Kou. The continuous self-detonation of three powerful beings, followed by the self-detonation of another's physical body, left Dou Kou in a daze, his body shattered but forcibly reassembling.

Su Yu, with his Heaven Gate open, saw the chaotic aura converging and a blaze of fire rising!

"Ah!"

A piercing scream echoed throughout the world.

"Save me!" Dou Kou roared!

At this moment, with Su Yu's side having killed three Daofuse Realm experts, a total of seven Daofuse Realm experts had perished, falling like rain.

In the distance, Zishui roared, sealing the heavens and earth, forcibly sealing Doubao, who opened its massive mouth to sever the path of retreat, leaving no chance for assistance!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Doubao was repeatedly knocked back, and from its enormous mouth, streams of the power of laws spilled out—not blood, but something equivalent to its blood.

The battle had entered its most intense phase from the very start! Neither side engaged in any probing or excessive dialogue; there was only slaughter!

"Die!"

The flames of the Burning Heaven rose, and a massive pen blade slashed out countless times, shattering the void with Su Yu's strike!

Boom!

A thunderous explosion resounded, and at that moment, Dou Kou's shadow appeared, revealing a ferocious expression as he self-detonated!

The immense power of the self-detonation swept across the heavens and earth!

"Heh heh heh, little one, kill me... you die too!"

Boom!

Su Yu was sent flying, his body shattered.

"Dou Kou!"

In the distance, several Heavenly Kings were furious. Dou Kou was dead! A Heavenly King-level expert had been killed, and in the blink of an eye, a Heavenly King-level expert had fallen in this battle!

Su Yu coughed up blood continuously, spitting out his internal organs, yet his heart was shaken. This race... was extraordinary!

Four Daofuse Realm experts self-detonated, severely injuring Dou Kou, and at that moment, he chose neither to flee nor to collapse but to self-detonate. Such a fighting spirit was something Su Yu rarely encountered nowadays.

It reminded him of Zhou Hao from the past! Yes, it was that kind of ferocity that emerged from a pile of beasts!

Too ruthless!

This was equivalent to using the lives of three Daofuse Realm experts, severely injuring one Daofuse Realm expert, and injuring Su Yu, a quasi-king, just to barely take down Dou Kou!

Boom!

As Su Yu was contemplating, the first to fall was Doubao. Doubao was pierced through by a sword, hanging on the blade, with a large amount of the power of laws flowing from its mouth, opening and closing with some confusion.

In its massive eyes, there was a hint of regret.

I... haven't eaten Tiangu yet!

"You lied to me... said I could eat Tiangu!"

Doubao mumbled, with some reluctance and regret, glancing at the distant Flatbread, feeling very unwilling.

But... I'm going to die.

Su Yu had killed a Heavenly King, but it couldn't match the Heavenly King before it. The opponent was strong, and these Heavenly Kings were not only powerful but also extremely ruthless, with combat experience even surpassing those who frequently fought in the lower realms!

"Doubao!"

Su Yu shouted, breaking through the air!

However, the Zishui, who had pierced Doubao with a sword, was also filled with boundless anger. Seeing Su Yu charging, with a fierce expression, the long sword, with Doubao skewered on it, was thrust towards Su Yu!

Carrying boundless killing intent!

Boom!

Doubao was instantly torn apart. Here, it was difficult to borrow the power of the River of Time or the past power of the Culture King. In fact, it couldn't borrow it now, having done so once before.

In an instant, Doubao shattered!

Streams of the power of the Great Dao spilled out; it was essentially a rule of the Great Dao.

The floating Mark of Civilization swept across.

In the Mark of Civilization, a pseudo-dao instantly broke!

Boom!

A strong rule burst forth, a firework following Dou Kou's firework ascending!

The slaughter erupted so swiftly and boundlessly.

A Heavenly King from the Chaos Race perished, and on Su Yu's side, Doubao was killed on the spot.

An extremely fierce slaughter!

And Su Yu quickly engaged in battle with Zishui. The next moment, Su Yu transmitted a message to the distance, his voice barely audible: "Great Qin, Great Xia... self-detonate your bodies!"

Boom!

Accompanying his words, the Great Qin King and Great Xia King, though momentarily stunned, felt a surge of ruthlessness in their hearts!

Compete in ruthlessness?

We have guarded the Human Realm for over four hundred years, fought countless battles, and when it comes to ruthlessness, who would flinch?

Boom!

The two second-tier experts self-detonated their bodies, still powerful Desolate Beast Daofuse Realm experts. The six Daofuse Realm experts surrounding them were almost instantly blown apart, with four or five dying instantly, leaving only one whose body shattered but whose dao hadn't broken, fleeing the scene with boundless terror.

Truly encountered ruthless people!

Fireworks continued to ascend.

The Mark of Civilization swept through the world again, and on one of its pages, a demonic dao expert appeared, also a Daofuse Realm expert, born from devouring the master of that rule. In an instant, it devoured everyone, including the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, and the severely injured fleeing Daofuse Realm expert, all swallowed by the demonic dao shadow!

And in the Mark of Civilization, multiple virtual daos broke again!

A large amount of the power of laws surged forth!

"Old Qin, Old Xia!"

In the distance, the Great Ming King roared, somewhat lost. Dead?

Su Yu's transmission had them self-detonate, and everyone only saw the self-detonation of their bodies. But the breaking of the power of laws caused a rule riot—did this mean they were dead?

Had they fallen?

And Su Yu seemed shocked and furious, roaring, "Bastards, who told you to self-detonate?"

Two second-tier Daofuse Realm experts self-detonated, killing six Daofuse Realm experts. Was it worth it?

Perhaps not!

And at this moment, the Chaos lineage was also shaken.

All were ruthless people!

In this brief moment of battle, the Chaos Race lost ten Daofuse Realm experts and one Heavenly King.

On Su Yu's side, three top-tier Daofuse Realm experts died, along with three Daofuse Realm experts he had captured.

Both sides suffered heavy losses!

A total of seventeen fireworks ascended into the sky!

This scene shocked the myriad races' experts in the distance and the three Heavenly Sovereigns flying in from the depths.

The Torchbearer lineage, so insane?

Directly exchanging lives for lives!

Seventeen top-tier experts, pinnacle existences of the Myriad Realms, just died like that.

At the same time, Su Yu's voice spread in all directions, roaring, "Kill, fight to the death! No retreat until death!"

The Great Zhou King's expression changed repeatedly!

"Everyone below the Heavenly King, self-detonate to kill the enemy!"

Su Yu roared, "Preserve your sea of will, if one survives, it's one!"

These words once again shook hearts.

All self-detonate?

And with these words, the next moment, boom!

Violent sounds echoed through the heavens and earth, and the entire Chaos Mountain was filled with the endless sound.

The Great Ming King, Heavendoom, Grandstar, and Flatbread all exploded their bodies in that instant, with madness, despair, reluctance, and unwillingness, suicidally charging towards those Daofuse Realm experts!

Boom!

This sudden self-detonation left the Chaos Race dumbfounded. They had never encountered such a situation in their battles with ancient beasts!

At the slightest disagreement, multiple experts self-detonated!

September hesitated slightly, gritted his teeth, and with a boom, flew into the explosion circle, charging towards a Daofuse Realm expert, detonating his body!

The Mark of Civilization swept through again, and in this chaos, no one could see anything clearly, only seeing fireworks ascending in the blink of an eye!

And those ancient marquises, at this moment, someone angrily said, "Retreat, we should retreat!"

Self-detonate?

Are they crazy!

At this moment, retreat was still possible!

Su Yu had gone mad, bloodthirsty!

And Su Yu, at this time, was being beaten back by Zishui, his eyes icy!

I said, listen to me!

Everyone below the Heavenly King, self-detonate their bodies. But... these ancient marquises didn't do it.

Indeed, the last time the Marquis of Zhennan self-detonated, it wasn't because Su Yu was too ruthless, but because the Marquis of Zhennan was saving Hundred Battle!

It should be known that among the ancient marquises, only Huoyun, Xuelan, and Nanxi were Heavenly Kings, while Shadow, Dingjun, Yingwu, Yunshui, Jianghai, and Wushan were not Heavenly King-level existences.

On Su Yu's side, eight experts were gone in an instant.

Out of 23 experts, 8 were gone, leaving 15, mostly ancient marquises or generals.

The remaining ones were Su Yu, the Great Zhou King, Lantian, Wan Tiansheng, Marquis Tongtian, and Fat Ball, with Marquis Tongtian having received Su Yu's transmission not to move.

In the blink of an eye, a third of them were lost.

And on the Saint Race's side, below the Heavenly King, 30 Daofuse Realm experts suffered from so many experts self-detonating, and in the blink of an eye, seven or eight Daofuse Realm experts died, but there were still over ten Daofuse Realm experts!

Su Yu shouted again, "Self-detonate!"

Those ancient marquises' faces changed drastically, Jianghai and the others facing over ten Daofuse Realm experts, Jianghai shouted, "We can fight, we can retreat..."

It's possible!

One against two, it's still possible to fight!

"Self-detonate!"

Su Yu shouted angrily again!

The others remained silent, gritting their teeth, madly charging at those people, self-detonate what?

They could fight!

Why self-detonate?

In the crowd, Marquis Dingjun glanced at Su Yu, with some helplessness and sorrow, he transmitted, "Protect my daughter... I... can't represent them!"

Boom!

A violent explosion suddenly erupted!

After this sound, General Yingwu on Marquis Dingjun's side also looked at Su Yu, then at Marquis Yunshui and the others, revealing a helpless expression, with some melancholy, realizing... they still couldn't unite as one!

Even I am hesitating, aren't I?

What exactly is Su Yu doing?

Boom!

Another deafening explosion echoed, followed by a cascade of fireworks!

At this moment, everyone alive was driven mad, utterly stunned.

The battle had just begun, and yet, wave after wave of Daofuse cultivators perished. Su Yu's side instantly lost ten members.

Only thirteen remained!

The Chaos Race suffered even more devastating losses, completely unprepared for the Torchbearer lineage's madness. Right from the start, they resorted to self-detonation, reducing their thirty Daofuse cultivators to merely seven or eight!

Among these remaining Daofuse cultivators, those left were exceptionally powerful; the weaker ones had long been obliterated in the successive self-detonations!

The survivors were now besieging Shadow Marquis and his group, filled with shock and awe!

They feared these few might also self-detonate!

Everyone had gone mad!

This was merely the first battle, yet what kind of grudge, what kind of hatred, drove these Daofuse cultivators to self-detonate without hesitation?

...

In the distance.

The Heavenly Kings engaged in combat were all aghast, their expressions changing drastically.

Madmen!

This guy is a madman!

Over there, Yue Hao, who was suppressing Fat Ball, felt a chill run through his heart and roared, "Who are you?"

This is a madman!

This is not how battles are fought.

This truly is a case of killing a thousand enemies while losing eight hundred of your own.

If everyone fought like this, the Daofuse cultivators of the Myriad Realms would have long been wiped out.

In battles among Daofuse cultivators, the goal is to kill if possible, flee if not, and if escape is impossible, fight to the death with a chance of survival.

No one fights like this!

These aren't ordinary soldiers!

These are Daofuse-level powerhouses, the pinnacle of existence, yet here they are, being used as bombs by that madman to deplete the enemy!

Even if the Sacred Race wins this battle, the losses are too severe!

Over twenty Daofuse cultivators and one Heavenly King have died!

Su Yu no longer paid attention to Shadow Marquis and his group, who were four against eight, but Shadow Marquis and his companions were strong and might not necessarily lose.

He bared his teeth, somewhat crazed, "Fight to the death! Kill me! You traitors to the Human Race deserve to die! Even if we perish, you will be exposed, and you will die!"

"Kill!"

Su Yu was utterly frenzied, charging towards Zishui, shouting maniacally, "Self-detonate! All of you, self-detonate! If you can escape with your sea of will, do it! Kill all these beasts! If you can't escape, take them down with you!"

The Heavenly Kings were all horrified.

Self-detonate again?

Madman!

The greatest madman under the heavens!

Never before had they seen such madness!

Boom!

A massive explosion resounded through the skies, countless clones of Lantian detonated, causing Yueqin to vomit blood incessantly, while the remaining clones of Lantian's aura plummeted to an extreme!

"Tiansheng... kill her... hehe, kill her..."

The remaining clones of Lantian were incredibly weak, continuously vanishing.

Wan Tiansheng gritted his teeth, the Path of Seven Emotions and Six Desires erupting continuously, relentlessly attacking Yueqin.

Su Yu shouted frantically, "Huoyun, are you going to defy orders? Blow up those bastards on the other side!"

"......"

Huoyun Marquis and his companions' faces all changed.

Madman!

Must it end in mutual destruction?

Reaching this level of cultivation is incredibly difficult!

Huoyun Marquis's eyes flashed with a struggle.

He could ascend to Heavenly King because Su Yu helped him, and he had promised to help Su Yu kill a Heavenly King... that was his promise.

At this moment, Huoyun Marquis's mind was in turmoil.

In the final moment, with a sense of helplessness, unwillingness, and anger, he roared, "You're a madman!"

A complete madman!

I shouldn't have accepted his help to become a Heavenly King.

Otherwise, I could be like the others and ignore this!

Boom!

A thunderous explosion swept across the heavens and earth, the immense power of the fire path roared wildly. The opposing Heavenly King, having anticipated this, fled rapidly at the moment of self-detonation, his body continuously exploding and regenerating...

By the time he escaped the battle zone, his aura had plummeted, filled with lingering fear and terror.

Is this how battles are fought outside?

This was his first time fighting against external powerhouses!

He had fought fiercely against ancient beasts, but it was never like this.

His first external battle had filled him with fear. The clan had said that external powerhouses were nothing special, and when Yuxi and the others went to kill, they did so with ease, making them think external powerhouses were no big deal!

But now?

Now... he was terrified!

If everyone outside was like this, could the Sacred Race win?

As he pondered these thoughts, Marquis Tongtian, who had been silent and inconspicuous, suddenly opened a portal, and Su Yu vanished from Zishui's front, reappearing before that Heavenly King!

Boom!

A blade descended, catching the recently escaped, still fearful Heavenly King off guard. With a thunderous explosion, his body was completely obliterated!

The Mark of Civilization swept through once more!

All the flesh was enveloped!

Throughout the battle, the Mark of Civilization had hovered in the air, sweeping across the heavens.

The second Heavenly King had fallen!

Su Yu laughed loudly, "Dead! Kill all you beasts! Even if we lose, you will accompany us to the grave!"

He shouted fiercely, "Moon Heavenly Venerable, don't forget to release the giant axe, he owes me, I've killed two Heavenly Kings and many Daofuse cultivators!"

In the distance, Moon Heavenly Venerable and his group were battling ancient beasts.

At this moment, each of them was filled with lingering fear.

These are madmen!

In less than a minute since the battle began, the Chaos Race had lost two Heavenly Kings and twenty-two Daofuse cultivators!

On Su Yu's side, one Heavenly King had died, ten Daofuse cultivators had died, and three other unknown Daofuse cultivators had died, whom they couldn't really distinguish, but they could generally feel they weren't part of Su Yu's group.

In total, fourteen powerhouses had died, and the Chaos Race had lost twenty-four!

Thirty-eight top-tier powerhouses... gone in the blink of an eye!

Such a battle, such a war, had never been seen except at the end of each tide!

March's face changed drastically, and in the next moment, he killed an ancient beast with a single bamboo strike and flew madly towards that side. The enemy's three Great Heavenly Venerables were approaching!

Not only that, but it seemed the depths had also sensed the ferocity of Su Yu's group.

More auras rose once again!

Perhaps even the ancestor hadn't expected that so many powerhouses on Yue Hao's side would be so quickly decimated by the enemy's suicidal attacks!

No one fights like this!

Even in ancient times, they didn't dare to fight like this!

This was just a skirmish; if everyone fought like this, the thousands of Daofuse cultivators in ancient times would have been wiped out in dozens of battles, leaving no one to become marquises later.

...

Su Yu panted, laughing, utterly frenzied!

He had killed two Heavenly Kings!

Xuelan, Nanxi, and the Great Zhou King were still each fighting a Heavenly King, while Zishui gritted his teeth and suddenly stopped pursuing Su Yu, instead charging towards Shadow Marquis and his group!

First, kill these guys, join forces with the eight Daofuse cultivators, and then kill Su Yu!

Shadow Marquis's group of four was strong!

Shadow, Yunshui, Jianghai, and Wushan were all second-tier, while the opposing eight had only two second-tier, the rest were inferior, so four against eight, they had a slight advantage.

But now, a Heavenly King had arrived.

Wushan's face changed drastically, instantly transforming into a mist, shouting, "Human Lord..."

Su Yu had no enemies at the moment!

Because Zishui hadn't come for him, Su Yu could assist them.

However, at this moment, Su Yu didn't care about them but looked towards Xuelan and Nanxi, grinning, "Self-detonate your bodies, blow up these bastards..."

Xuelan and Nanxi's faces changed.

The Heavenly King they were fighting also changed his expression, again?

Youzhen's face was filled with madness, "Only you know how to self-detonate?"

Boom!

A thunderous explosion, Youzhen's body exploded, transforming into a powerful sealing force, sweeping towards them, Xuelan General's body was shattered, vomiting blood incessantly, and in the next moment, she was directly sealed by that powerful sealing force!

At this moment, a formidable aura erupted from Xuelan, the power of ice sealing, directly freezing the entire world!

The third Heavenly King of the Chaos Race had fallen!

Forced into it!

Only you know how to self-detonate?

Can't we?

Youzhen was also afraid, these madmen were too terrifying.

Rather than waiting for the opponent to self-detonate, it was better to self-detonate, Youzhen's sea of will didn't self-detonate but chose to flee.

However, Su Yu appeared once again, the Mark of Civilization sweeping over, a powerful pen blade slashing down, boom!

Directly obliterating the opponent's sea of will!

Su Yu laughed maniacally, "I'll make you pay!"

Boom!

As he spoke, in the distance, Fat Ball was struck by Yue Hao's chain, shattering its body, blood staining its entire form.

Fat Ball felt a bit lost.

"Master... hasn't returned yet..."

Defeated!

No matter how strong the boots were, they weren't its own, its biting path hadn't reached its peak, and at this moment, it couldn't match Yue Hao.

Not only was it defeated!

Over there, Lantian transformed into a seductive woman, with a radiant smile, burning up.

"Tiansheng, kill this bitch... I'll dance for you..."

The seductive Lantian, with a holy smile.

"All beings suffer, I save all beings... free them from the sea of suffering! The world laughs at my madness, I laugh at their ignorance... in this world, it's hard to find a confidant..."

Intense flames burned the heavens and earth!

Countless Lantian phantoms appeared, each with a face, each with a word.

The Path of All Beings!

Countless Lantian phantoms threw themselves into the sea of fire, perishing in the flames, burning their bodies for all beings!

At this moment, Su Yu didn't care about them.

The Great Zhou King had already suppressed Yuxi, but Nanxi Marquis was struggling against another Heavenly King.

Zishui charged towards Wushan and his group, instantly gaining the upper hand!

At this moment, Su Yu looked towards the Great Zhou King.

The Great Zhou King also turned to look at Su Yu, his eyes filled with bitterness, helplessness, and an indescribable sigh, "My Human Race... why must we suffer..."

In the next moment, a formidable aura surged from his body!

Yuxi, who was fighting him, showed a pained expression, and in the blink of an eye, a portal appeared on her forehead!

The Gate of Hell!

In this place, only she and Yue Hao had this portal.

Over there, Yue Hao was frantically whipping the White Dog, his face suddenly changed, and he instantly traversed the void, roaring, a portal appeared, it was his Gate of Hell!

Boom!

Chapter 768: A Moment of Madness

The Great Zhou King's body exploded!

The Gate of Hell, which Yuehao had placed in front, and the one belonging to Yuxi, both shattered simultaneously!

The Culture King's boot appeared, stomping down fiercely!

Boom!

Yuehao's head was crushed!

Meanwhile, Su Yu, with his Mark of Civilization, swept through the battlefield. Alongside the White Dog, he appeared beside Marquis Nanxi. One wielded a blade, the other bit ferociously. Boom!

The powerful enemy fighting Marquis Nanxi was obliterated on the spot by the duo!

Marquis Nanxi's expression shifted. Su Yu smiled and said, "Go save them!"

With a slight change in expression, Marquis Nanxi immediately flew towards Shadow Marquis and the others in the distance!

Su Yu, with a smile, glanced at the White Dog. The White Dog looked distressed, its tail severed, and glanced at the retreating Yuehao and Yuxi, seeking guidance.

What should we do?

Su Yu laughed, then looked towards Yueqin on the other side, sending a message, "Kill this old woman, then... escape!"

Yes, it was time to flee!

Marquis Nanxi was teaming up with four second-tier marquises. Let them handle their fate.

As for me, this time, I aim to kill a Heavenly Sovereign!

In the next moment, the pen dao erupted with an overwhelming aura, burning to its peak. All the power of laws exploded, and the White Dog also controlled the boot, stomping towards Yueqin!

Over there, Lantian burned all his avatars, and with a thunderous roar, an explosion resounded.

Wan Tiansheng smiled upon seeing this, then looked at Yueqin's terrified face. She sensed the crisis of death and wanted to flee!

But Wan Tiansheng was still there!

"Let's... be buried together!"

Boom!

His entire being exploded in an instant. Su Yu's Starry Sky Seal suddenly appeared, suppressing the opponent for just a moment. In that instant, the White Dog stomped down, shattering Yueqin into pieces, while Su Yu, with his pen dao burning to the extreme, pointed a stroke at her Great Dao!

Creak!

A sound of rupture echoed through the heavens and earth!

The pen broke!

And Yueqin's Great Dao, with a thunderous crash, was completely severed!

A shadow emerged!

A powerful surge of rules erupted, a brilliant firework so dazzling that it could be seen clearly throughout the Upper Realm!

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian, who had been following Su Yu, roared, and a portal appeared.

Grabbing the White Dog, Su Yu vanished into the portal in an instant, filled with madness, mockery, and unwillingness: "I will return... even if... I become a vengeful spirit, I will return!"

Boom!

The portal was pierced by an enraged Yuehao, a chain piercing through the heavens and earth!

Further away, Shadow Marquis and several others roared madly. Boom! Several Daofuse experts were instantly killed, and the few remaining were gravely injured and on the brink of death. Marquis Nanxi's expression suddenly changed.

Su Yu had escaped!

But... he didn't take them with him.

"Run!"

He grabbed a few people and fled madly outward, for he could already feel Yuehao's fury spreading towards them!

Shadow Marquis's body trembled, coughing blood incessantly, gasping, "Nanxi... you all escape... go find... go find..."

Boom!

A violent explosion sounded, and Shadow Marquis exploded instantly, killing two more of the pursuing Daofuse experts.

In the next moment, Mist Mountain roared, "Go!"

Boom!

Another explosion resounded, a powerful mist enveloping the heavens and earth, obscuring all directions. Behind them, except for Zishui who managed to escape a bit, the other Daofuse experts were directly corroded to nothing by the mist!

Marquis Nanxi, clutching Yunshui and Jiang Hai, tore through the void at unimaginable speed, roaring, coughing blood continuously, and vanished in an instant!

Just as Yuehao was about to pursue, his expression suddenly changed. Over there, auras of Heavenly Sovereigns were rising!

Beside him, Zishui also retreated instantly.

Behind them, Yuxi, with a pale face, quickly approached.

Above the vast pit, in an instant, only the three of them remained!

In the sky, dozens of fireworks were rising.

Like a dream!

To the three of them, everything felt like a dream.

One minute!

Yes, just one minute.

In this minute, they lost 30 Daofuse experts, 4 Heavenly Kings, and one Heavenly Sovereign!

And the other side... also suffered countless casualties!

Was it worth it?

At this moment, Yuehao was bewildered!

Behind him, three auras of Heavenly Sovereigns rose, and in the blink of an eye, three Heavenly Sovereigns arrived.

Everyone who saw this tragic scene was silent.

Filled with confusion!

...

Opposite the Chaos Forest, several Heavenly Sovereigns had killed dozens of ancient beasts and were now rushing over, covered in blood.

Opposite them, 4 Heavenly Sovereigns, two Heavenly Kings.

The sixty or seventy Daofuse experts just now seemed like a dream.

Gone in the blink of an eye!

The faces of Yue Tianzun and the others showed a hint of emotion; the Torchbearer lineage had gone mad.

Mad to the extreme!

And at this moment, Yue Tianzun suddenly struck, blasting apart a black light. It was an ancient beast from the Chaos River attacking a light cluster. Yue Tianzun instantly grabbed the light cluster, somewhat shaken: "Heavenly Dragon Marquis!"

Someone was still alive!

Heavenly Dragon Marquis, his sea of will had actually escaped!

He didn't have time to think more, instantly nurturing Heavenly Dragon Marquis's sea of will, looking across with a heavy heart!

Not to mention the 4 Heavenly Sovereigns on the other side, deep within... there seemed to be more auras rising!

Very powerful!

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign's face was also extremely grim: "This lineage... is too strong! Also, why did the Torchbearer lineage do this?"

Mad to the extreme!

Over 20 top-tier experts, Marquis Nanxi escaped with two people, while Su Yu seemed to have only taken Marquis Tongtian and Fat Ball with him.

Such a powerful force was buried here just like that!

What kind of enmity led them to make such a choice?
