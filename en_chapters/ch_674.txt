Chapter 674: The Grand Dream Turtle

In the Grand Dream City, the guardians were successfully replaced. Excitement and exhilaration filled the hearts of each guardian, emotions beyond words.

Before Su Yu, more guardians gradually appeared. He chose this moment to liberate them, granting them more freedom. This was to prevent any complications in the Death Realm and the Spirit Suppression Realm, ensuring there were no gaps in their defense.

"Do not lift the Petrification Technique for now!" Su Yu reminded them. The Petrification Technique was an excellent method to seal their aura and resist the death energy, allowing them to enter the Death Realm without causing too much disturbance. He himself couldn't perform it, but if he could, he would have petrified all the living beings entering the realm, as it was incredibly useful.

All the guardians listened silently, their emotions still in turmoil. Su Yu glanced at them, contemplating his own matters.

There were 35 guardians, with Heavendoom and a few others being familiar faces. The rest were strangers to him. However, Su Yu indeed needed them, as they were the ones most likely to advance to the Daofuse Realm.

People like Xia Longwu had reached the seventh stage of the Eternal Realm, exhausting all their foundations. Advancing further wasn't as simple as defeating a few marquises. These guardians, on the other hand, had honed their realms sufficiently, lacking only the push from the power of laws.

Guarding for 100,000 years without rest, while other realm experts had the chance to slumber, they did not. They constantly resisted the Death Realm and its death energy. Their contributions were immense!

As Su Yu sipped his tea, he pondered for a long time before speaking, "All of you guardians are heroes of unparalleled merit! Of course, I understand that such merit might not be what you desire or consider as true merit."

"The sudden downfall of the ancient era trapped you here for 100,000 years. Some might see this as a punishment."

Su Yu looked up at the silent guardians, "Resentment, hatred, anger—everyone harbors some of these emotions. Some might not even know who to blame, while others might blame the ancient humans or the myriad races of the past..."

In the crowd, Heavendoom wanted to speak, but Su Yu raised his hand to stop him. Without letting Heavendoom speak, Su Yu continued, "All of you have helped me, Su Yu, many times before. Today, I won't play word games with you. Those who resent, hate, or feel unwilling to fight for me, considering our past camaraderie, I am liberating you today. You can choose to continue with me or leave."

Su Yu spoke calmly, "If you choose to leave, do not reveal your presence for a while. Or, you can stay in the Grand Dream City for some time. The Spirit Suppression General will not harm you."

Heavendoom wanted to speak again, but Su Yu smiled, "Senior Heavendoom, not everyone is like you, happy to fight at any opportunity! Among the 35 seniors present, some are surely tired and unwilling to fight anymore. Previously, they had no choice, as they were guardians, a united front!"

"But now, that's no longer the case!"

Su Yu looked at the crowd, smiling, "You don't have to be roasted over the fire by Heavendoom and the others. If they enjoy fighting, that's their business! Seniors, if you're tired, find a place to rest and recuperate."

"I have no other requests, just one... I hope none of you will defect to the myriad races!"

At this, Su Yu said calmly, "Today, I put my words here. As long as you do not defect to the myriad races, whether you choose to fight or not, if I win, you will all still be heroes, and your contributions will be rewarded!"

"But if you defect to the myriad races... all past camaraderie and merit will be nullified, and you will become my targets for elimination!"

Su Yu looked at them, and among the guardians, some had complex expressions, some were indifferent, and some whispered among themselves.

Beside Su Yu, the old turtle was also sipping tea. His cup had long been empty, yet he held it nervously.

How many would leave? How many would stay?

The old turtle actually thought Su Yu's offer was good. They could leave on their own. Since Su Yu said he wouldn't pursue them, he surely wouldn't. As the Human Emperor, he had to keep his word, especially in front of his own people and generals.

He feared that some old comrades might choose to defect to the myriad races. If that happened, Su Yu would surely keep his word and eliminate them!

Seeing that no one spoke, the old turtle finally said, "Old friends, if you're truly tired, find a place to rest for a while. I know a few small realms with beautiful scenery! Once we win, we can gather again, drink, and feast! The Emperor said not to defect to other races... I share the same sentiment. We don't want to meet on the battlefield as enemies!"

He looked at the crowd and sighed, "Back then, it was my fault! This guard duty lasted 100,000 years..."

"Boss!" Among the crowd, a guardian interrupted the old turtle, "Boss, no one wanted what happened back then! You did it for us, guarding for a millennium, receiving rewards and being appointed as generals were all good things. The King of Gong gave you a cushy job, but things went wrong later!"

Guarding the Death Realm was considered a cushy job. There wasn't much danger! In that era, which death spirit dared to break out? The four Heavenly Kings were all obedient. If a death spirit marquis dared to break out, the old turtle didn't even need to act. He could just call one of the four Heavenly Kings to handle it. Whoever's spirit it was, they would deal with it!

Heavendoom, looking somewhat impatient, said, "Alright, enough of this! Brothers, speak up. Who wants to leave? We won't stop you! Su Yu... ahem, the Emperor is right. As long as you don't defect, we're still brothers!"

"Those who stay, let's continue! It's not just for the humans, but for our own strength and safety! We used to be untouchable because we were guardians. Now, we're not. An Eternal can be killed easily in this war of the Myriad Realms!"

Heavendoom wasn't foolish. Those who thought he was were the real fools. He was an Eternal ninth stage, mingling in the Myriad Realms with a fiery temper. Back then, so many marquises, yet no one dared to trouble him. Why?

The old turtle was one reason. Another was that Heavendoom was one of the few who had a good relationship with some of the Culture King's students. When the Culture King's students forged the Culture Tomb, Heavendoom was present, though he didn't understand it!

Forging the Culture Tomb wasn't something just anyone could witness. Heavendoom, barely, was considered part of the Culture King's faction. Those marquises and kings had to give him some face.

At this moment, Heavendoom understood clearly. If they didn't fight, Su Yu wouldn't help them become stronger. Unsealing them was repaying past favors. Protecting them appropriately, not letting them get involved in the war, was also repaying favors.

After winning, promising to reward them was also repaying favors.

But Su Yu wasn't foolish. He wouldn't help those who didn't fight to reach the Daofuse level. That would be making trouble for himself. If these people defected to the myriad races, Su Yu would be foolishly aiding the enemy.

Eternals could be easily suppressed, but Daofuse would be difficult.

...

The group of guardians hesitated. Defecting to the myriad races, whether they had such thoughts or not, no one would voice them now.

That would be courting death!

Not to mention, they knew about the Death Realm's situation.

Most were hesitating about whether to fight or retire!

After 100,000 years, they were indeed tired.

Some didn't want to fight anymore!

Previously, they thought Su Yu would make them all fight. Now, he gave them a choice. Since the boss didn't object, it meant that choosing to leave now, Su Yu likely wouldn't pursue them.

They might not trust Su Yu, but they trusted the old turtle.

In 100,000 years, not a single guardian was replaced, and all guardians were alive. This was due to the old turtle's protection. Otherwise, a group of guardians, merely Eternals, did they really think the Upper Realm couldn't take them down?

After a long time, the Guardian of Changping slowly said, "In the past, I received some benefits from the gods and demons. Of course, time has passed, countless years have gone by, and I won't speak of these. Mainly, I'm truly weary! Today, since the Emperor has given me a chance... I'll be frank. I don't want to fight anymore!"

The Guardian of Changping said solemnly, "My race is extinct! Now, I'm all alone, not for my race, not for power, just for... freedom!"

Heavendoom and the others looked at him, initially dissatisfied, but soon, they were relieved.

Everyone has their own choices!

Yes, freedom.

Everyone desires it!

But Heavendoom and the others want to fight for their freedom themselves. If they don't fight now, this freedom won't come easily.

Su Yu had no objections, smiling, "Senior Changping, I understand! It's best to bring it up now. I have no other requests. Those who wish to leave, stay in the Grand Dream City for a while. Once the new guardians are exposed, or the Death Realm's matters are revealed, seniors can find a place to recuperate!"

Changping nodded, taking a deep breath.

He chose to withdraw!

Bowing to the old turtle and Heavendoom, Changping said nothing more. Soon, he looked at the others, bowing slightly, "If you stay, I wish you a smooth journey. Today, I, Changping, am a deserter. I... am tired!"

With that, Changping vanished instantly. The next moment, a house in the Grand Dream City opened, and Changping entered the ancient house.

His attitude was clear. He wouldn't come out!

When it was time to leave, he would leave.

Among the crowd, some guardians sighed, some felt regret.

After 100,000 years of camaraderie, today, someone left, and no one could curse him.

Even the irritable Heavendoom didn't curse him.

Simply because he was tired.

Su Yu continued, "Anyone else? Don't worry too much. To be honest, even if you stay... you might not have the chance to reach the Daofuse Realm. Without reaching Daofuse, you might not have the chance to change anything..."

Su Yu chuckled, "When it comes to battle, it all depends on willingness. Right now, everyone's willing, but when the tides turn against us, it's almost impossible to fight. At the moment, I still value camaraderie, but if things go south and people start fleeing... well, that’s not camaraderie anymore."

He smiled, "Let's be upfront about this. The Spirit Suppression Army is too important to me. I don't want a minor issue to lead to a conflict with the entire Spirit Suppression Army."

The old turtle remained silent, but Heavendoom spoke up, "Rest assured, since we've chosen to join the battle, we won't flee."

He glanced at someone and said, "Shan Qi, I think you might run. Maybe you should leave..."

In the crowd, a burly man looked at Heavendoom and, after a moment, said quietly, "Do you really want me to leave? You're just provoking me because you can't bear to see me go, right? I know what you're thinking. You can't boast about Grandstar and the others anymore, and no one else pays attention to your bragging, so you've set your sights on me, haven't you?"

"…"

Heavendoom snorted, denying it.

Shan Qi laughed and said, "I'm not leaving! I've guarded the Necro Passage for so many years without ever venturing into the Death Realm. I might as well go see the sights! If I'm lucky, I might even get a title of marquis someday, fulfilling my wish."

Some chose to stay, while others decided to leave. Among the few female guardians, one named Yuhong, whom Su Yu was somewhat familiar with, stepped forward, looking frail. "I won't be joining the battle. Don't worry about me. I've always been the weakest. Over the years, the leader has worried a lot about me. Everyone else has a chance to advance to Daofuse, but I probably don't. I've been holding everyone back, and my injuries haven't healed... I'll take a break."

The old turtle spoke, nodding, "Yuhong should withdraw. Over the years, you've injured your very foundation. Even your path is damaged."

He looked at Su Yu, "Emperor Yu, you're aware of Yuhong's injuries..."

Su Yu nodded, "I know. Senior Yuhong, find an ancient house to rest. When it's time to leave, I'll inform everyone, and you can all depart then."

The guardians communicated among themselves, and eventually, a few more chose to leave: Changping, Yuhong, Suiyu, Haizang, and Yuehua. These five city guardians decided not to participate in the battle anymore. Ten thousand years of erosion had left them thoroughly weary.

The remaining thirty chose to stay. Some wanted to grow stronger and no longer be the weak ones, some wanted to fight for freedom, and some stayed for the camaraderie. Since Heavendoom and the others were joining the battle, they would too.

It was better than expected.

Su Yu chose to speak openly to show respect to the old turtle and Heavendoom. He didn't want to discuss this before unsealing them, to avoid making them feel coerced. Clearly, the old turtle and the others understood Su Yu's intentions. If he had discussed it before unsealing them, perhaps none would have chosen to leave. If they left, what if they weren't unsealed?

The guardians were powerful, and Su Yu didn't want to create discord with them over such matters. Letting a few leave wasn't a big deal. As they said, even if they stayed, they might not reach Daofuse. With fewer people, Su Yu could concentrate resources to meet the advancement needs of some.

Soon, Su Yu said, "About replacing the ancient cities..."

The old turtle smiled, "That's not difficult! The ancient cities are our weapons. Some structures, including the method to convert the undead, don't rely on the weapons but on the power of laws outside the passage! The new guardians just need to suppress their weapons in the core area, and we can extract ours!"

Su Yu nodded, "Will it cause much commotion? There are still many half-undead in the ancient cities."

The old turtle laughed, "Whether there's a commotion or not, as long as the outside world doesn't know, it doesn't matter. The strongest in the ancient cities are Sunmoon Realm. We can easily conceal it. What can a Sunmoon Realm discover?"

Su Yu laughed, "True! Also, the new city lords shouldn't contact the ancient city lords for now!"

After some instructions, the matter was settled. The guardians began their handovers.

...

In Grand Dream City, others gradually left the City Lord's Mansion. Those who needed to prepare did so, and those who wanted to gather did as well. It was rare to be unsealed, and the old guardians were in good spirits, eager to drink and feast before anything else.

They all left, but the old turtle and Su Yu stayed behind. The old turtle sipped his tea, and after a moment of silence, he said, "Five left, which isn't unexpected. Emperor Yu, if any of those who stayed betray you, you can hold them accountable. As for the five who left..."

Su Yu smiled, "Don't trust me?"

"It's not that."

The old turtle chuckled, "It's not about trust, just concern! Concern that if the situation turns unfavorable, you'll forcibly conscript them."

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "I won't. Since I promised, I won't go back on my word! If the situation reaches a point where even five Eternals must join the battle, then we've essentially lost, and their participation won't change anything."

Su Yu didn't dwell on it, smiling, "Let's not talk about this. Rest assured! I'll give a basic level of trust. Don't worry about me doing anything. Let's discuss the situation in the Death Realm."

Su Yu didn't mention the guardians again and quickly said, "Are you familiar with the South Heavenly King?"

"Not really."

The old turtle thought for a moment, "The Four Heavenly Kings have existed for a long time, not ancient powerhouses but rather ancient ones! After the Human Emperor pacified the Myriad Realms, they went to suppress the Death Realm, and four powerful beings were appointed as Heavenly Kings!"

Su Yu nodded, "So, there's no master of rules in the Death Realm? I heard that mastering the great path is possible. I know the Death Realm has only one great path. I mean, is there anyone comparable to the ancient Human Kings? In ancient times, some Human Kings walked the physical path and reached the power of a master of rules. In my view, the death path is much more formidable than the physical path!"

He was genuinely curious. In ancient times, some Human Kings had the power of a master of rules. What does that mean? Someone who could fight dozens of Daofuse cultivators!

The current Four Heavenly Kings are strong, but fighting five or six is their limit. The Hundred Battle King is also strong, but he might still fall short of a master of rules. He fought a dozen or so, and among them were many top-tier beings. The Hundred Battle King might indeed be close to that level.

These were all physical path powerhouses. And the physical path, as it stands, seems inferior to the death path. So why doesn't the Death Realm have such beings?

The old turtle didn't understand the rules of the great path, but when Su Yu asked, he thought for a moment and said, "I have a theory."

"What is it?"

"The Celestial River of Death!"

The old turtle spoke softly, "Because there are too many undead and powerful beings slumbering in the Celestial River of Death! It's not that there are only a few strong ones, but rather many. And these beings, once dead, occupy the power of the great path! The Four Heavenly Kings feel they can't advance, but it's not just a feeling; they truly can't because it's all occupied!"

Su Yu understood, "You mean the death path is almost filled! Only a limited amount of the power of the great path remains, divided among the Four Heavenly Kings... In that case, the beings in the Celestial River of Death are terrifying! In my view, if the human physical path can produce a few masters of rules, then the death path should at least double that!"

The old turtle nodded, "There should be many, but I've also noticed that when a master of rules dies, they might not revive as undead! The Celestial River of Death likely contains many marquis-level Daofuse beings! Or perhaps, when a master of rules dies, they can become undead, but these masters of rules occupy the power of the great path and can't revive due to insufficient power!"

Su Yu realized, "So, if a master of rules dies, their strength in life was too great. The death path, being just one path, no matter how strong, can't support their revival. But they likely still exist at the river's bottom?"

The old turtle smiled and nodded, "Exactly!"

Su Yu agreed with the old turtle's assessment.

"Let's continue discussing the South Heavenly King."

Su Yu prompted, and the old turtle thought for a moment, "I haven't interacted much with the South Heavenly King, only met a few times. Since being appointed, the South Heavenly King has kept a low profile. Over the years, it's fortunate that the South Heavenly King was there. The East, West, and North Kings, after the ancient downfall, attempted to break free. At that time, the West King's stance was unclear, but the South Heavenly King intervened several times. Plus, in my Spirit Suppression Domain, their power was suppressed, making them no match for me and the South Heavenly King. So, over the years, the Death Realm has remained relatively peaceful."

"The West King's betrayal likely happened later, around the end of the Ninth Tide."

The old turtle looked at Su Yu, "It was probably that woman who led him astray. Initially, the West King just wanted to be a local overlord. For many years, there was no movement from the West King."

Su Yu was speechless, "Even in death, an undead can be deceived by a woman... The West King deserved to die!"

A lecher, even as an undead, still thinking about such things. Serves him right!

The old turtle laughed, "It's normal. At that level, undead still have emotions! Speaking of which... ahem, the South Heavenly King is actually female."

"…"

Su Yu looked at the old turtle, who said meaningfully, "The South Heavenly King... when appointed, requested the title of South Heavenly King. At that time, everyone knew that the Culture King resided in Nanyuan, one of the Four Extremes Human Kings, known as the South King!"

"It's quite normal. At that level, undead are not much different from the living. Back then, many female powerhouses were enamored with the Culture King!"

The old turtle sighed, "The Culture King was unparalleled, captivating both the living and the undead..." 

[UNMAPPED_TERMS]
山启 = Shan Qi

Su Yu nodded. "I understand now. Life and death, both sides of the same coin! So, the South Heavenly King supports the Human Race because of the Culture King? Speaking of which, the Culture King once stayed in the Death Realm for a while. Could it be that he was trying to woo the South King?"

The Old Turtle remained silent. "I don't know about that, so don't ask me."

Su Yu chuckled. "Interesting! So, the South King is a fan of the Culture King. No wonder she's been supporting the Human Race's rule all these years! Hearing this from you, Senior, puts my mind at ease."

The Old Turtle laughed. "Emperor Yu, rest assured. If the South King intended to betray us, the three Heavenly Kings would have joined forces long ago, and I wouldn't have been able to hold them off! The Death Realm would have been in chaos by now!"

"Indeed!" Su Yu agreed. For now, it seemed there was no major issue with the South King.

The Old Turtle continued, "This time, as Emperor Yu plans to suppress the North King in the Death Realm, I suspect it won't be that simple."

"What do you mean?"

"The North King is possibly the strongest among the four Heavenly Kings! And the living beings going down there can't be too many. The Culture King's dog, Fat Ball, shouldn't go. Its blood and qi are too strong, and its presence might disturb the Celestial River of Death, attracting unbeatable foes!"

The Old Turtle spoke gravely, "It's best to rely on the dead themselves, along with us guardians, and those like Heavendoom who have the Stone Transformation Technique! I suggest not bringing any other living beings! If three to five dozen Death Lords are truly drawn out, how will we contend with them? Even Heavendoom and the others shouldn't enter, as their Stone Transformation Technique has been lifted!"

"And under the North King, there are still 14 Death Lords entrenched in the North King's domain..."

Su Yu glanced at him. The term "entrenched" seemed inappropriate coming from a turtle.

The Old Turtle also looked at Su Yu, as if to say, "Don't nitpick. 'Entrenched' is a term you humans use to describe me!"

The Old Turtle didn't bother to argue further and continued, "Over there, he is, after all, an appointed Heavenly King. Even Emperor Yu can't easily remove him from his position! So, in the North King's domain, the South King is no match for him. The South King's ten Death Lords can't contend with the North King's fourteen. Even with the four from Lanshan, they barely match up, but they will definitely be at a disadvantage..."

The Old Turtle went on, "As for me, it's best not to leave. If I leave, and the Celestial River of Death acts up, a few Death Lords might emerge, and the new guardian won't be able to suppress them! If a Death Lord breaks through... it will be a huge problem! Your problem, my problem!"

The Old Turtle said solemnly, "I've already sensed it. A Death Lord is awakening. Last time, you should have sensed it too, but they were wary of Fat Ball's strength and didn't come out!"

Su Yu nodded. He had indeed sensed it.

"Moreover, Emperor Yu must be cautious. Be wary of these awakening beings suddenly joining the battle! That would be even more troublesome!"

Su Yu nodded again and quickly said, "Even if Heavendoom and the others don't go, with 27 guardians, all at the high stage of the Eternal realm, they should be able to handle three or four Daofuse, right?"

The Old Turtle nodded. "That's true, but the margin for error is too low! Daofuse can afford many mistakes, but we can only afford one. If one of us is killed, the encirclement breaks, and the formation scatters, it will be a massacre! If six guardians are needed to match one Daofuse, and one is accidentally killed, the pressure on the remaining ones increases, making it easy for a second, third to be killed..."

The margin for error was indeed too low!

Matching them was possible, but...

Su Yu rubbed his chin. Indeed, living beings entering would provoke the Celestial River of Death, which was the real problem. Otherwise, there would be no need to worry so much.

They could just crush them!

Bring in the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, and the others, and have a grand battle.

Su Yu pondered for a while and still said, "Senior, come with me. Let the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King temporarily guard this place! Even if a Death Lord attacks, it won't matter if the two Daofuse fight back!"

"The fear is that more Death Lords will be drawn out!"

The Old Turtle was still a bit worried. This wasn't ideal. He was actually more suited to guarding this place.

Su Yu thought so too, but... without the Old Turtle, they didn't have enough power to crush the enemy. Lanshan Marquis was progressing quickly, but even so, she hadn't reached the level of a Heavenly King.

As for Su Yu himself, he wasn't sure of his current strength, but one thing was certain: he definitely wasn't at the Heavenly King level!

The Book Spirit and the Tea Plant might not be able to go in, and the White Dog was out of the question.

So who else could he bring?

The Great Zhou King... The Great Zhou King was good at concealing his breath, but if he went all out, he would still expose his aura.

Half-dead spirits would be best!

Find the South King and have a few Daofuse converted?

Forget it!

Su Yu felt a headache coming on and quickly said, "Let's go down first and take a look. As for the North King, if we don't actively provoke him, he probably won't dare to leave the North King's domain. Once he steps out, he loses his greatest advantage and protection!"

The Old Turtle nodded, "If it doesn't work, we can leave the North King's domain alone for now."

Su Yu, however, disagreed. "There are too many variables. If I draw forces from the Death Realm, and he launches a surprise attack, killing all the remaining strong ones and camping in the passage, it's over. The Death Realm will be out of control!"

In that case, it would depend on whether the North King had the guts. Su Yu didn't want to leave such a big hidden danger!

The two discussed for a while but hadn't decided on a course of action yet.

They could only wait for Su Yu to meet the South King, gather Lanshan Marquis, and then discuss a strategy.

After discussing these matters, Su Yu looked at the Old Turtle and smiled. "Senior, your path seems strong. You've lived for so long, so logically... you shouldn't be weaker than a Heavenly King! Enjoying a single path should make you a top-tier Daofuse, maybe even mastering the power of laws..."

The Old Turtle looked at him. "Are you mocking me?"

Su Yu laughed. "Don't misunderstand, Senior. I mean, let me take you on a journey down the path to gain some insights! Your current path is still focused on understanding the great path. Otherwise, I'm afraid you won't be able to advance further!"

The Old Turtle thought for a moment and nodded. "Then I'll trouble Emperor Yu. However... I'm not sure if I can comprehend it."

"Let's give it a try!"

Su Yu wasn't sure either. The Old Turtle seemed a bit dull.

Having lived for countless years, he might not even understand what the great path is, acting purely on instinct, just knowing how to retreat and defend... Ahem, it fits the great path perfectly, which is impressive in its own way.

Soon, Su Yu tore through the River of Time, taking the Old Turtle along to his great path.

With the Old Turtle, Su Yu didn't need to exert much effort, as the Old Turtle was strong on his own.

...

In the River of Time.

Su Yu quickly reached the tributary of the great path. The Old Turtle had some sense of it but didn't comprehend it deeply. Su Yu didn't mind describing it to him, marveling, "This path, I think, should be called the Path of the Mountain!"

"Senior might not see it, but to me, this path is like a great mountain, a crouching mountain, resembling... your true form! It should have been created by the Hongmeng Turtle Race!"

"This path is not weak! Of the paths I've seen, the Death Path is first, the Physical Path second, the Pen Path third, the Five Elemental Path fourth, the Desolate Beast Path fifth, and your path, Senior, I'd rank sixth!"

Just slightly weaker than the Desolate Beast's path.

Compared to other fused paths, Su Yu thought it was stronger. Soon, Su Yu added, "So, Senior's race isn't lacking in understanding the great path. Do you know who created this path?"

It's from your race, and they could create a path!

The Old Turtle was silent for a while before saying, "It should have been created by my Dao companion."

"......"

Su Yu was taken aback.

The Old Turtle slowly said, "Countless ages ago, there were two turtles in the world, nameless, without a surname, without a race... Later, they used my name to name the Hongmeng!"

Su Yu was stunned again.

"The other was my Dao companion, also a semi-emperor of the Hongmeng Turtle Race..."

Su Yu blinked.

Wow!

There's such a story?

It's... unbelievable!

But thinking about it, it makes sense. The Hongmeng Turtle Race used the name Hongmeng. Su Yu thought it was because the Old Turtle believed all his kin had died, so he renamed himself Hongmeng. He didn't expect it was named after him from the start!

The Old Turtle spoke softly, "My Dao companion was killed long ago, in the ancient times. She was much smarter than me. I was lazy, unwilling to move or think, so she was always stronger than me. This path, according to your description, should have been created by her."

"In my race, only she could have created this path."

"Later, my descendants gradually died, and the Hongmeng Turtle Race was left with only me..."

Su Yu frowned slightly. "I remember you mentioned that in ancient times, your race also had a semi-emperor..."

"That was my son."

The Old Turtle spoke softly, "He died later too. His strength was actually average. Though called a semi-emperor, he never entered the council! Because of this, my status in ancient times wasn't low, but personally, I didn't like to move."

With a self-deprecating smile, the Old Turtle looked at the tributary of the great path. Even if he couldn't see anything, he regretted, "My Dao companion created a strong path, but unfortunately... I was born foolish and couldn't grasp the path she left behind. For countless ages, I couldn't comprehend it."

After speaking, he looked at Su Yu and said, "Now that you've mentioned it, I think I know where I went wrong."

"I have some insights, but I focused more on defense. However... you're actually wrong. You saw a mountain, right?"

Su Yu nodded. He saw a mountain.

"Actually, this mountain isn't for defense."

Su Yu was stunned, and the Old Turtle laughed. "You've been influenced by me. My Dao companion was best at combat! The mountain might be the ancient divine mountain we saw in the past. My Dao companion likely used the divine mountain as her path, focusing on attack!"

Attack!

Su Yu was stunned again. Yes, he had been influenced by the Old Turtle, thinking the mountain was for defense.

The Old Turtle sighed, "No wonder! It turns out... it's about attack! I took the wrong path and could only rely on time to grind. But no matter how much I grind, I can't grasp this path. Only by changing, focusing on the path of attack, can I master it!"

Su Yu blinked. Your wife was good at attacking, and you're only good at defending. No wonder you haven't mastered the great path in hundreds of thousands of years.

Turns out you took the wrong path!

The old turtle chuckled, "Well, now I mostly understand! Fortunately, Emperor Yu helped me see it. Otherwise, I might still be in the dark. No wonder King Gong told me back then that the Martial King wanted him to convey to me the importance of fighting more and guarding the Death Realm. It seems he wanted me to engage in more battles, but I just didn't get it."

The old turtle laughed again, "Give me a little more time, and perhaps... there will be some changes! I've fought many battles recently, and I find my path smoother. So that's it. In the previous nine tides, there was almost no fighting. No wonder I felt I hadn't made much progress, not much different from back then!"

Lazy!

Su Yu muttered in his heart. Indeed, the old turtle seemed immensely powerful even many years ago, and over the years, he truly hadn't made much progress.

He did, however, learn some interesting gossip!

The old turtle's partner was actually a master of laws. In the ancient era, the Hongmeng Semi-Emperor was his son! His son had become a Semi-Emperor, yet he was still sleeping as a Guardian General... If it weren't for King Gong urging him, he probably wouldn't have wanted to do it. Even when King Gong offered him a marquis title to guard the Luminous Domain Mansion, he was reluctant.

"And who was it that killed your partner, Senior?" Su Yu asked.

The old turtle shook his head, "It's been many years. Let's not mention it. That person should be dead too. My partner loved fighting, couldn't sit still. If she were like me, she might still be alive today."

Like you? Your entire race doesn't have that kind of path!

Su Yu was speechless.

As long as the old turtle had his own insights, it was fine. Su Yu almost led him astray, but it was actually the old turtle who led Su Yu astray. This was actually the path of battle!

Come to think of it, a turtle adept at fighting...

The image was too vivid!

Su Yu imagined if the old turtle were like Heavendoom, always eager for battle, then... the old turtle's partner must have been quite interesting. It's a pity she's gone. Otherwise, a turtle fighting every day would certainly make for an interesting design.
