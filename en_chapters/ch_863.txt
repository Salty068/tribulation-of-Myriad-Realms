Chapter 863: Return (A Request for Subscription)

The upper reaches of the River of Time.

The great battle concluded with the arrival of the Human Emperor. It was swift beyond measure!

The Divine Emperor and his remaining powerful allies fled, retreating upstream to escape.

Could they be pursued? Yes, they could!

However, if they were pursued further, Su Yu's domain would not extend that far, and it would become another protracted battle. Moreover, if all the Myriad Races' experts were killed, the suppression they provided would be lost. The Human Emperor and Su Yu might not be able to control the river's flow, accelerating its speed and forcing a swift return to the Myriad Realms, which could lead to the opening of the Three Gates.

In this battle, over forty rulers of laws from the Myriad Races were slain, including three top-tier experts!

The Divine Emperor retreated with fewer than fifty rulers of laws, along with fifty to sixty non-rulers, nearly a hundred in total, disappearing from sight.

From the original 125 rulers of laws, the Myriad Races had lost more than half after two battles!

As for Su Yu, he surveyed the surroundings with an expressionless face, saying nothing.

There were losses, indeed.

Even though he had nearly taken on everything himself, resisting many powerful foes, the losses were still significant.

On the Human Emperor's side, the Radiant King and the Hundred Battle King had severed their paths.

Originally, aside from these two, the Human Emperor's faction, including the four Myriad Races' rulers of laws who surrendered last time, had 49 members, excluding the Human Emperor. This time, 27 experts merged into the Human Emperor's domain, leaving over 20 to fight in this battle.

But now... only 18 remained.

Besides the Radiant King and the Hundred Battle King, four experts had died.

Four had died last time as well, making it a total of eight rulers of laws lost from the Human Emperor's lineage over two battles.

On Su Yu's side... he glanced around, slightly stunned.

Someone... was gone.

His people were actually gone!

Besides himself, there had been 35 experts on his side. He had brought the Great Zhou King, the Book Spirit, and several from the Dark Division, not counting those from the Dark Division, making it 38 experts, plus Xingyue, whom Su Yu hadn't managed yet.

Out of 38 experts, some were missing now.

He scanned the crowd, noticing everyone was injured.

During the fierce battle, he hadn't paid much attention. The battle's intensity was overwhelming, and he hadn't had the mind to notice. Now, he frowned slightly.

After a while, Su Yu calmly asked, "Where are Nanxi and Lie Kong?"

Silence enveloped the surroundings.

After a moment, Wan Tiansheng, somewhat weak, softly replied, "They died in battle."

Su Yu knew.

He just wanted to know how they died.

It shouldn't have happened!

Or rather, Su Yu didn't want to know; he just wanted these people to come up with a reason to fool himself.

Wan Tiansheng remained silent for a while, then added, "In this place, Lie Kong's spatial path was too restricted, and his teleportation path was almost useless. As for Nanxi... Yingwu was in danger, and he went to save her... and died."

Su Yu fell silent.

After a while, he spoke, "Did Nanxi do it because I said he once betrayed me, or because he once disobeyed my orders, and he wanted to prove himself?"

Wan Tiansheng and the others remained silent.

Su Yu looked at them and slowly said, "As for Lie Kong... how do I explain this to Shi Kong?"

He wasn't very familiar with Marquis Rift Space.

The Space Ancient Beast Race's king in the Upper Realm.

The consort of the Space Ancient Emperor in the Lower Realm, Marquis Rift Space, had given Su Yu the hidden spatial teleportation path of the Space Ancient Beast Race upon their first meeting.

Shi Kong had just been integrated into the Human Emperor's system because the spatial path was occupied by Rift Space, leaving no choice but to send him to the Human Emperor's side.

Now, Rift Space had died in battle.

Su Yu remained silent. How would Shi Kong react to this?

Two rulers of laws had died on his side.

It seemed unbelievable because Su Yu's side held the advantage. Even those who had recovered from injuries sought Su Yu out, and Su Yu's side had more rulers of laws than the enemy.

In reality, aside from the top-tier battle, few experts died elsewhere.

Including the Myriad Races!

The Myriad Races lost over thirty on Su Yu's side, and nearly fifty retreated, meaning that in other areas, fewer than ten Myriad Races' experts died!

Su Yu hadn't had time to investigate, but if he did, he would find that the number of deaths... matched his side!

Six to six!

Yes, even with the Human Race holding some advantage, it was a draw.

Everyone remained silent.

Six rulers of laws died in one battle, yet the victory was significant, with nearly forty enemy experts killed. It was worth celebrating, but the main credit went to the top-tier experts, to Su Yu, and even to a few from the Dark Division.

Other factions didn't hold much advantage.

Su Yu remained silent for a while, then asked, "I want to know, with equal numbers, can we not defeat the Myriad Races?"

The Human Emperor, seeing Su Yu's question, sighed and said, "It's not like that. The weaker Myriad Races' members are all heavily injured! Those who dealt with you, the other weaker Myriad Races' members, were also killed by you last time... The remaining ones are the elite forces of the Myriad Races! Those who aren't heavily injured and avoid battle are the elite. In a desperate battle, their strength is unimaginable!"

This was the first time Su Yu realized that when the Human Race and the enemy's experts were evenly matched, the battle was a draw, which actually meant failure.

Because Su Yu's side had more people!

Su Yu remained silent.

In all the battles so far, the number of fallen experts under his command was minimal. The most memorable was the surprise attack on the Abyssal Realm, where Su Yu led the defense of the Human Realm, and several founding kings died in battle.

That time, Su Yu first realized that these founding kings, despite their flaws, dared to fight, were willing to fight, and were willing to die for the Human Race.

That battle made Su Yu's attitude towards some of the Human Race's eternals a bit better.

Before that, Su Yu only harbored resentment towards them.

Resentment for not helping the Multi-Divine Script lineage, resentment for their indifference, allowing internal strife within the Human Race.

Resentment for their descendants not willing to join the battle at critical moments.

Resentment...

It was only after that battle that Su Yu felt that being the Human Lord was worthwhile, at least these guys dared to fight at critical moments and didn't hold back.

But today... the deaths of Rift Space and Nanxi left Su Yu silent.

As the number of strong subordinates gradually increased, he felt a bit arrogant, thinking that he alone could fight against many powerful foes, and they shouldn't die, wouldn't die.

But at this moment, he suddenly realized.

As long as it's war, unexpected situations will always occur, and it's impossible to avoid them.

Six rulers of laws!

Four died last time, making it ten rulers of laws lost over two battles.

Su Yu had always been somewhat dismissive of Nanxi because he didn't listen to him initially. Su Yu had even named Nanxi before, and now, Nanxi died saving Yingwu...

Su Yu looked at Yingwu, this valiant woman, now with her head lowered, saying nothing.

The ancient marquises had split into two groups last time, one following Su Yu, the other following Hundred Battle, and Yingwu often scolded Yun Shui and Shadow.

Previously, Su Yu had killed Yun Shui and Shadow, and Nanxi and the others had defected. Yingwu usually didn't show them any kindness.

Today, she was in danger, on the brink of death, and Nanxi, the good-natured old man, chose to rescue her at that moment. This didn't align with Su Yu's orders, which were to handle their own opponents unless circumstances allowed, and never to exchange one's life for another's!

If Nanxi had the ability to save someone, there would be no issue, but the key was, he didn't.

He chose to exchange his life for another's!

Among the crowd, Wu Ji, Red Moon, and Marquis Zhennan all lowered their heads.

This battle was a great victory!

Yet, some experts still died, especially on Su Yu's side. Everyone held the belief that following Su Yu meant victory after victory, with no one falling in battle. Today, that myth was shattered!

The Human Emperor looked at Su Yu, offering no comfort. In the Human Emperor's view, deaths in war were inevitable. He just felt that Su Yu was still too young.

When his old comrades died, he would grieve, feel sorrow, but he wouldn't show it to anyone.

Because this was war.

Of the 36 original Human Kings, fewer than half were still alive, with the rest being later ascendants.

Old comrades were becoming fewer!

The Human Emperor directly ignored the fallen, not out of heartlessness, but because... he was the emperor!

At this moment, the Human Emperor suddenly laughed, "A great victory!"

His laughter echoed like thunder!

A great victory!

An eternal victory!

A battle that shattered the Myriad Races, with over half their forces lost, three top-tier experts dead, and the core leaders like the Immortal Emperor and Demon Emperor fallen. This victory laid the foundation for the war of the Myriad Realms, heralding the complete unification of the Human Race!

Su Yu looked at him, showing no sadness, only an incredibly calm expression, "Your Majesty, there's no need to change the subject. I've faced many setbacks and won't be defeated just because someone died... that's impossible! I just feel like I haven't done well enough. In a war with me present, our experts still fell, and that's the real issue!"

Sadness?

A bit, but more was self-blame. Yes, self-blame, because Su Yu... pursued perfection!

In this battle, six rulers of laws died, and he felt he hadn't calculated well enough.

The Human Emperor smiled wryly!

A great victory!

Ten rulers of laws died in total, but they exchanged for over seventy enemy rulers of laws, a 1:7 casualty ratio, and Su Yu still felt he hadn't achieved perfection.

Should I just die?

And Su Yu continued, "These are just the visible losses. In reality, our losses are even greater. The Radiant King probably can't recover, the Hundred Battle King still has hope, and I... am severely injured!"

Severely injured!

Indeed, it was a heavy burden, but at this moment, Su Yu didn't care much. Once you get used to the pain, you find that it actually makes you more alert and calm. His world was in chaos!

The explosions from those people had left his world in a mess, with at least a hundred paths shattered. Even Zhu Tiandao and the others, whom Su Yu had finally managed to gather near the Heaven Gate, had their paths somewhat broken. For them, a broken path essentially meant falling.

Fortunately, Su Yu had taken them away. Otherwise, the dark guards would have ended their mission as soon as they appeared.

At this moment, Su Yu was severely injured. The Radiant King had fallen a rank, the Culture King's world might have been exposed, and the Great Zhou King had some paths broken... These were losses that couldn't be seen.

Even the Human Emperor himself, Su Yu noticed, seemed to be only at the second rank. Perhaps his world hadn't been drawn here, and only within his world could he possess first-rank combat power. Such losses were extremely severe. A top-tier expert like the Human Emperor was now half-crippled.

The Human Emperor sighed at this but quickly regained his smile. "But we... won, didn't we?"

Only then did Su Yu gradually smile. "We won! And we defeated our opponents without the Human Emperor's assistance!"

"......"

He specifically mentioned this, leaving the Human Emperor speechless. Was he implying that they could win even without him?

Well, that was indeed the case. But the Radiant King and the others were my people, you know?

Su Yu then turned his gaze to the Radiant King and suddenly laughed, "They say among the Four Extremes Human Kings, the Radiant King has the weakest presence, not even matching the status of the Four Extremes Human Kings. But today, I have a newfound respect for you!"

Calm in the face of danger, decisive in action, able to sever paths when needed, and merge when necessary. Even someone like Zhan Wang listened to him, with numerous methods to stabilize the world... It could be said that if not for the Radiant King, Su Yu's side would have likely lost more people, and Su Yu himself would probably have chosen to abandon other paths, leaving only the Life and Death Path, because it allowed him to resurrect.

This was also the first person Su Yu praised in this battle!

The Radiant King chuckled, "Your Majesty Emperor Yu overpraises me!"

Su Yu, however, laughed, "No, if I had to choose between the Martial King and you as a partner, I would choose you. Pure warriors can be quite annoying at times. You might be much weaker than the Martial King, but you're far more useful than him!"

The Human Emperor was a bit helpless, smiling wryly, "If Taishan hears this, I'm afraid..."

Su Yu laughed, "Do I fear him hearing it?"

Well, the Human Emperor was speechless.

This battle also established Su Yu's position. The surviving experts, if it were before, even the Suppressing Martial King might not have been able to hold back. But now, she just pursed her lips and said nothing. Her husband was being looked down upon by Su Yu right in front of them, which was quite displeasing.

But... Su Yu was formidable!

With many methods, having killed many, and being ruthless, even if the Suppressing Martial King didn't like to think, she knew not to provoke someone like him. Her husband couldn't afford to provoke him either, even if he was stronger than Su Yu. If Su Yu decided to kill him, he wouldn't even know how he died.

At this moment, another warrior, the Martial Emperor, somewhat awkwardly grabbed someone and threw him onto the ground, muttering, "What should we do with him?"

At this moment, Gui was filled with despair and fear!

He didn't even know what he had just experienced. He only knew that several first-rank experts had died, and the rulers of laws had died in droves. This was his first time seeing Su Yu, and he appeared so cold.

And beside Su Yu was the rumored strongest of this era, the Human Emperor. Yet, standing next to Su Yu, the Human Emperor seemed much kinder, while Su Yu appeared far more terrifying.

"Su Yu... no, no, Emperor Yu!"

Gui was in despair, hurriedly saying, "Don't kill me... I'm useful. If you kill me, if you kill me... Emperor Yu will suffer great losses. If I die, my friends within the gate will all know..."

Su Yu looked at him, having not paid attention earlier, and only now realized he had connected him to a rather useless path, the path of charm. It was somewhat similar to the path of Moon Luo.

Unfortunately, Gui was truly ugly, wretched, and hideous. This charm path on him was completely mismatched, making people feel awkward and disgusted instead.

To turn the charm path into such a mess, he was truly a talent.

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "Weren't you comparable to the Human Emperor at his peak? Didn't you boast that you were one of the strongest within the gate? Gui, were you lying to me?"

Su Yu's expression turned cold, "I hate being lied to the most. If you were truly the strongest, your true self descending should have no problem killing three to five first-rank experts, right? Yet, you couldn't even defeat a Demon Emperor!"

Gui almost cried, "The Demon Emperor's path is stronger than mine!"

He hurriedly said, "Emperor Yu, I... I just entered the first rank. I didn't mean to deceive Emperor Yu, I just... just..."

"You thought I'd be slapped to death by you anyway, so it didn't matter whether you told me the truth, right?"

"No, absolutely not!"

Gui was terrified, surrounded by strong experts, their murderous aura boiling. He had witnessed the massive number of experts who had just died in battle. After severing his path, he quickly dodged, avoiding death.

Now, he didn't want to die just like that. Otherwise, it would be too unjust!

Su Yu raised an eyebrow slightly, "Those who cultivate the physical path are all warriors. Yet, you, a warrior, are so afraid of death!"

Gui wore a bitter expression, "We... we've cultivated for countless years, and there aren't many battles within the gate. How... how can we compare to your bloodthirstiness!"

This was the truth.

Gui suddenly felt that even if the gate opened, could those people really defeat this group of killers?

Each one of them, to Gui, seemed too bloodthirsty!

Whether it was Su Yu's side or the Human Emperor's side, who among the rulers of laws hadn't been fighting continuously over the years?

Within the gate, there might not have been a large-scale battle for thousands or even tens of thousands of years.

Su Yu laughed!      He waved his hand casually, "Take him away, hand him over to Lantian for custody later!"

Everyone exchanged glances but said nothing.

They quickly captured Gui, who didn't dare resist and had no strength to resist. With some helplessness and pessimism, he suddenly said, "Emperor Yu... Emperor Yu, my... my friends..."

"What's the rush!"

Su Yu laughed, "You don't need to do anything. I'll impersonate you and chat with them for a bit, reassuring them to continue projecting their power. Eventually, their true selves will descend. It's best if they call more friends over, so I can deal with them one by one!"

"......"

Gui was utterly hopeless. Did this mean he had no chance at all?

Su Yu, however, ignored him.

He looked again towards the upper reaches of the river and softly said, "If we wait here, will they continue to be pushed down?"

The Human Emperor thought for a moment and nodded, "Yes, the power from the upper reaches is getting stronger and will push them down. But by forcibly resisting upstream, there's an advantage: it can delay the opening of the Three Gates... Until they are pushed down, and we are too, the Three Gates will officially open!"

Su Yu understood.

He thought for a moment and said, "On the Myriad Races' side, there are still 4 first-rank experts, and among the rulers of laws, after this battle, some will advance. Those Heavenly Venerables and Heavenly Kings, some are still alive, probably maintaining around 50."

That's still a formidable force!

The Human Emperor nodded.

That was inevitable!

He looked at his side and smiled, "On our side, more will emerge!"

Then he asked, "What are your thoughts now? Continue the pursuit, or wait here?"

After this battle, the Myriad Races would only hold on upstream, waiting for the Three Gates to open. They probably wouldn't return, nor dare to, until Su Yu and the others left. Only then would they retreat, allowing the Three Gates to appear with them.

Su Yu pondered for a moment and asked, "Human Emperor, if we pursue them and kill them all, what price would we have to pay?"

The Human Emperor considered, "They have no way out now, a fight to the death, even a battle of despair. If they go all out... we'll definitely lose more than 10 rulers of laws, maybe even more!"

This was his answer, considering Su Yu's extraordinary abilities.

Otherwise, with over 50 strong experts and four first-rank ones, how could they take them down without losing twenty or thirty?

Su Yu laughed, "Then forget it, let's not pursue them for now. Scaring them is good enough because we'll progress faster than them. Time is actually on our side!"

What progress could the Myriad Races make?

Su Yu and the Human Emperor, however, could enhance themselves through their worlds!

More people would advance, more would improve, and their strength would only grow stronger!

This battle, having killed countless strong experts, wasn't without benefits.

There were already several more first-rank experts!

Su Yu looked at the Human Emperor and asked, "How are things on your side?"

"Not too sure..."

Just as he finished speaking, the Human Emperor smiled, "They're here!"

Soon, a group of people appeared from afar.

All were rulers of laws!

And there were quite a few of them, more than before. Previously, the Human Emperor had taken 27 strong experts, and now, over 30 had arrived, indicating that many had advanced, including some of the ancient marquises under the Human Emperor and those Su Yu had sent over.

For instance, Dingjun... Su Yu was surprised to see Marquis Dingjun!

This guy, having failed to break through several times, had finally gotten lucky and succeeded this time.

A group of strong experts quickly arrived, and soon, the two sides gathered, inquiring about the situation, all ecstatic!

A great victory!

Everyone couldn't help but look at Su Yu. This guy was too monstrous!

The key issue... what about the Radiant King and Zhan Wang?

Not just them, at this moment, seeing Su Yu and the Human Emperor chatting, the Great Ming King couldn't help but speak up, "Um... Ancestor, could you give up the path? I..."

The Radiant King rolled his eyes, annoyed, "I just reconnected the path. My great path was broken, a first-rank path, just reconnected, and I've just endured the backlash. If I give up the path again, I might die from the backlash. Do you think I'm as weak as you? Cutting paths at will without much impact?"

Speechless!

The Great Ming King was stunned, "Then... Ancestor..."

Radiant King was exasperated. "What do you know? I've severed my path, and without my formations to suppress it, Emperor Yu's realm might collapse. Aren't you supposed to be skilled in formations? Can't you see that? Are you an idiot?"

"......"

The Great Ming King, known for his cunning, was momentarily taken aback. Suddenly, he seemed to go mad. "You did it on purpose, didn't you?"

He abruptly turned to the Radiant King's Consort, lamenting, "Great-grandmother, he did it on purpose! He saw that His Majesty had a bright future and deliberately severed his path to steal mine! Great-grandmother, not only does our ancestor not support the Zhu family's descendants, but he also snatches away their grand paths!"

The Great Ming King was anxious. "I took this path from my son, and now he's taken advantage of His Majesty's realm's tremors to snatch it away from me, and he won't give it back!"

The Human Emperor, observing the scene, coughed lightly and tried to console him. "Don't be upset. You can come to my realm. My path of formations..."

"I refuse!"

The Great Ming King was truly anxious now. "No way! Even if I have to change my path within His Majesty's realm, I won't go! I've finally become His Majesty's logistics chief..."

He almost said, "I've finally climbed to the top, how could I go to your place and be a subordinate?"

Besides, your future is tied to His Majesty... Ahem, that's not something I should say, but unless absolutely necessary, I won't go!

The Human Emperor's mouth twitched, but he quickly smiled and chuckled. "It's fine, no worries."

Despite his words, he transmitted a message to Su Yu, "Send that brat to me. I don't want anyone else, just him! The Radiant King and Battle King aren't suitable to sever their paths now. I don't want them. Send that rascal to me immediately. My path of formations... it's him!"

Ha!

You want to compete with me?

You don't give me face?

The Human Emperor's smile was radiant, though internally he was cursing. Who do you think you're dealing with?

Su Yu's lips curled slightly. For a moment, he didn't know what to say.

After a while, he transmitted back, "We'll see. The Great Ming King was the first to support me, even before the Xia family..."

This... is true.

When he left the Great Xia Prefecture, Zhu Tiandao was the first to accept him, and the Great Ming King showed his support. Otherwise, a genius fleeing from one prefecture to another would have caused trouble.

Later, when he faced a crisis in the ancient city, it was the Great Ming King and the Great Xia King who came to his aid.

So, regarding the Great Ming King, if he's unwilling, we'll see.

Su Yu knew the Human Emperor meant no harm, but... the Great Ming King's words were quite satisfying to hear.

Listen, even if I have to change paths, even if it's not suitable for me, I won't leave. I want to follow His Majesty, not you, Human Emperor... How satisfying!

But this logistics chief of the Great Ming King... who appointed him?

Even Su Yu was confused. The Zhu family and the Xia family, each claiming to be commanders and chiefs, but did I appoint anyone?

Goodness, you even call yourself the logistics chief!

Did I ever mention this?

I haven't had any logistics work to do recently, have I?

He didn't say anything, but Radiant King's face turned dark, as if he cared deeply about this third-tier grand path. Damn it, I'm a top-tier first-class expert, the kind who could slap you to death. If it weren't for necessity, do you think I'd sever my path?

Radiant King didn't want to speak. Su Yu's realm was indeed unstable.

He still needed the power of formations, a third-tier path of formations, to maintain the previous stable grand formation. Otherwise, if he severed his path, the formation would shatter, and soon, Su Yu's realm would collapse!

This grand formation wasn't simple; it was fueled by the willpower sea of a first-class expert!

At this moment, strong experts from both sides gathered, and more were arriving.

Su Yu looked at the Human Emperor and exhaled. "You should go back first. Your realm isn't stable, and you haven't stabilized your realm. Your path isn't strong. It seems you haven't absorbed the Human Emperor's path..."

At this moment, the Great Zhou King spoke softly, "Your Majesty and the Human Emperor should both return. Here, I, the Martial Emperor, King Yue, the Book Spirit, the Suppressing Martial King, and the Radiant King's Consort... we can lead the defense. Everyone else can go back and rest. We're still fine!"

Staying here was extremely exhausting, and the time was too short, not as fast as the recovery in the Myriad Realms.

Here, it was somewhat a waste of time.

Now, the myriad races wouldn't dare to return rashly. Besides, on this side, almost all the first-class experts were present.

Su Yu was half-crippled, Radiant King was also crippled, and the Human Emperor was almost the same. Staying here was useless.

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded slightly. "Then you stay here and coordinate with the others. By the way, do you need to reconnect the paths you severed here?"

The Great Zhou King smiled. "That would be best... Otherwise, I might soon fall to second-class. But if reconnected, I might only be able to maintain second-class strength, without the opportunity to enter first-class."

As for the Martial Emperor, he truly profited this time.

The Martial Emperor, feeling a bit uneasy, coughed and said in a muffled voice, "Um... does the Immortal Emperor count... count as my kill?"

Does it count?

I did contribute!

Su Yu looked at him calmly. "If you say it counts, it counts. If you say it counts, you can leave now. I won't keep you!"

"......"

The Martial Emperor snorted, said no more, and turned to leave.

Fine, then it doesn't count!

Leave?

I'm not leaving!

Damn, I've only been here a few days and already stepped into first-class, and you want me to leave?

Am I really that foolish?

Ha!

The Martial Emperor had thought it through. Until he could fight Taishan, he absolutely wouldn't leave. Here, the improvement was too exhilarating!

Although now, he had reached his limit, without Su Yu's advancement, he had no chance. But Su Yu, this bastard, improved so quickly!

Although he was severely injured this time, so what?

Su Yu recovered quickly too!

Others might not know, but the Martial Emperor knew that Su Yu was definitely eyeing the experts inside the Heaven Gate, planning to lure them out, eliminate them, and merge their paths into his realm. The power of the realm could recover quickly.

...

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with the Martial Emperor. He looked at the Human Emperor and smiled. "How about it? I'm now accompanying Your Majesty, both of us becoming spirits of the realm."

The Human Emperor raised an eyebrow slightly. "Can your physical body recover?"

"It can."

Su Yu nodded. "The spirit of the realm isn't much different from before. The only difference... Your Majesty knows, is that I'm now completely connected to the realm. Unlike before, I could abandon the realm and connect with the River of Time. Now... I can't!"

Su Yu shook his head. That's the difference.

He and the Human Emperor were the same. The Human Emperor had no choice, but Su Yu didn't mind. The physical body could still be restored. Becoming a spirit mainly meant that his willpower sea was connected to the realm.

If he truly abandoned this identity... the realm would surely be destroyed!

The Human Emperor looked at Su Yu and suddenly sighed. "The two of us, one calls himself the Human Emperor, the other the Emperor Yu... can we still be considered human?"

Not anymore!

After speaking, he couldn't help but laugh, and Su Yu, in fact, knew that the Human Emperor still longed to preserve his human identity. But at this moment, he had indeed become a spirit in essence.

Su Yu was the same!

Su Yu also laughed, and around them, a group of people laughed along, but each wore a complex expression.

These two, speaking lightly at this moment, but in reality, everyone felt a bit helpless and sad. Two top human experts, leaders fighting for humanity, had both lost their human identities.

Existing in the form of spirits!

Isn't this tragic?

Su Yu didn't pay much attention to this. He looked at the Great Zhou King and the others, then at the Human Emperor, and smiled. "Let's go back and rest. After this battle, both of us need to recover our strength... There are still many tough battles ahead!"

The Three Gates are the key.

As for the myriad races, just scare them for now.

After this battle, no one would dare to cause trouble again.

The Human Emperor nodded. "I need to quickly recover my strength. Otherwise, it's too embarrassing!"

Leaving the realm, being second-class, the Human Emperor almost felt too ashamed to face anyone!

At least, leaving the realm, he should maintain first-class combat power, then it would be barely acceptable!

With that, the two of them walked downstream together, and the injured experts followed.

Behind them, the Great Zhou King and the others chose to stay and guard the place, not giving the myriad races a chance to return.

Only when the two had gone far did the remaining experts breathe a slight sigh of relief. The Suppressing Martial King, holding a machete, couldn't hold back and spoke, "Zhou Tian, this Su Yu..."

Beside him, the Martial Emperor sneered, "No discipline!"

The Suppressing Martial King's face turned cold. "He's gone. Try being arrogant again?"

"I'm first-class now. Do you think I'm afraid of you?"

The Martial Emperor was arrogant. "What, your man doesn't dare to come back, so you want to fight me instead? Little bug, even if you're first-class, I can still deal with you!"

The Suppressing Martial King was filled with killing intent. She hated this guy.

And the Martial Emperor was equally disdainful. Am I afraid of you?

I've reached first-class. I'm not afraid of you at all!

The Great Zhou King watched, feeling a bit helpless. He almost forgot these two had a grudge.

Both were first-class, but... the Martial Emperor didn't consider that the Suppressing Martial King had a group of sisters. Are you sure you want to fight her?

He was pondering, hoping these two wouldn't cause trouble.

Suddenly, Su Yu's ethereal voice echoed, "I don't care how you fight. If you kill each other, I won't care either. But if you two first-class experts don't kill two enemy first-class and bring me their corpses... if you dare to waste each other's strength... I'll kill you both! Hmph!"

A cold snort shook the realm.

The Martial Emperor pursed his lips, saying nothing.

The Suppressing Martial King muttered under her breath, saying no more.

Forget it!

Can't be bothered to argue with this husband-defeated Martial Emperor!

The Martial Emperor found an excuse for himself. A good man doesn't fight with a woman. Fine, just ignore her!

The Great Zhou King saw the two first-class experts instantly quiet down and was speechless.

Su Yu... had enough deterrent power over these two!

Not to mention the Martial Emperor, even the Suppressing Martial King feared Su Yu. The feeling was completely different from her bold demeanor in front of the Human Emperor.

Beside him, the Radiant King's Consort smiled, appearing much more amiable. She was only fierce towards the Radiant King; otherwise, she was usually gentle. At this moment, she glanced in the direction where Su Yu and his companions had departed, lost in thought.

Is my husband truly unwilling to leave Su Yu's world, or is he genuinely unable to? Is he taking root for the Human Emperor, or does he have his own plans? After all, Su Yu's rise has been astonishingly rapid!

The Radiant King's Consort knew her husband was very shrewd. Perhaps he was doing this on purpose, seizing the path meant for their grandson's grandson and not returning it! The thought made her chuckle. Just moments ago, the Great Ming King's lamenting expression had left her speechless. What could she say when his ancestor had taken his path?

With these thoughts, she turned to the Great Zhou King and asked, "Zhou Tian, what do you think of these two human emperors?"

The Great Zhou King remained silent for a moment before speaking, "The Human Emperor is the righteous path, while Emperor Yu... is the demonic path!"

Everyone was taken aback, left speechless for a while. There was some truth to his words.

The Great Zhou King pondered further and added, "They are two sides of the same coin. Emperor Yu needs the existence of the Human Emperor, and the Human Emperor, in turn, needs Emperor Yu. Together, they complement each other, and I believe the human race will grow stronger because of it!"

With a sigh, he continued, "The demonic path... was also my creation!"

He chuckled self-deprecatingly, shook his head, and sat cross-legged on the ground, no longer speaking. This tide of the demonic path, wasn't it something I created myself? It was I who forced them to become demons!

The Great Zhou King thought to himself, yet he felt no regret. If they hadn't become demons, perhaps the human race would have been doomed. Now, at least, there was a chance—a significant chance! The Three Gates may be strong, but as long as you all are here, that is success!

He silently gazed into the distance, reflecting on many things, recalling some of the past.
