Chapter 841: Dark Clouds Looming

Broadly, their directions aligned, but the specific details still needed discussion, which would take some time.
For their first meeting, reaching this point in their conversation already exceeded expectations.
Both were quite satisfied!
So, Su Yu and the Human Emperor decided to discuss further next time, both needing to prepare.

As the two were about to leave, they suddenly heard the Great Ming King exclaim in surprise from afar, "Old Ancestor, Ancestral Grandmother is still alive?"

"Old Ancestor, you wouldn't believe it, every year during festivals, our family offers sacrifices to our ancestors, and you, Old Ancestor, are always among them!"

"Old Ancestor, ever since I learned you were still alive, I changed my name to Little Ming King. Back then, I didn't know you were alive, otherwise, I wouldn't have dared to call myself Great Ming King. That would be a taboo!"
"..."

Over there, the conversation was heated!
The main speaker was the Great Ming King!
Compared to Xia Longwu's deadpan expression and his less-than-polite attitude towards Zhan Wang, the Great Ming King was excessively courteous towards Radiant King.

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and the Human Emperor wore a faint, unreadable smile.
"Good heavens!"
"The Zhu Family certainly has good upbringing!"

Just then, the Great Ming King joyfully declared, "Old Ancestor, our Zhu Family's lineage has prospered to this

Great Ming King scoffed, "Idiot, whose fault is it that you don't have a powerful ancestor! Look, this formation plate... what a treasure! I reckon, if it stabilizes my sea of will, even a Third-tier ruler of laws wouldn't be able to shatter me! I can forcibly endure a blow from a Third-tier ruler of laws, then kill him with a counter-attack. It's like having an extra life, what do you know!"

Great Qin King was speechless.

Su Yu smiled, not paying it much mind. It was a good item, but it wouldn't have a huge impact on the overall war, otherwise, Great Ming King wouldn't have given it away.

They were all shrewd individuals!

Everyone just gave each other some face and curried a little favor, and that was enough.

Too many generations had passed; there was no real familial affection, but a sense of closeness remained, as they were, after all, of the same bloodline!

Moreover, for War King and the others, not much time had actually passed on this side.

A thousand years, constantly fighting, so some familial affection still existed. Unfortunately, they weren't direct descendants... As for Xuelan, if she met Snow King, Snow King would probably be very excited. It was just unknown whether Snow King was still alive.

At this moment, after a period of laughter and banter, everyone quickly quieted down and looked at Su Yu.

It seemed Su Yu had just had a rather good talk with the other party

The purpose of the fighting was simply to weaken the Myriad Races, or was it to… give Su Yu hope to stand before everyone, to let the ancient powerhouses know that even if the Human Emperor died in battle, there was still someone who could rise!

Wan Tiansheng pondered deeply!

…

At the same time.

The Human Emperor, War King, and Radiant King walked forward together. The Human Emperor suddenly smiled and said, “Old Zhu, what do you think of Su Yu?”

The Radiant King considered for a moment before saying, “I haven’t interacted with him, nor do I have a deep understanding of him, but observing the proud and fierce generals under his command, each of them holds him in great awe. Su Yu… is not simple! For someone so young to command such respect from these individuals is not something an ordinary person can achieve! I even specifically spoke a line with the Martial Emperor, and casually brought up Su Yu… The Martial Emperor’s expression was a bit stiff, showing annoyance and embarrassment, but he wasn’t overly enraged… It was as if he had been subdued, yet was unwilling to admit defeat, but had no choice but to accept it!”

He was also a shrewd individual!

A single sentence was enough to deduce many things.

He continued, “I know Giant Axe, Wu Ji, and the others. I spoke with them briefly. Wu Ji was previously under the ninth generation Human Lord, Hundred Battle. He only joined Su Yu later, and his allegiance is quite recent. However, towards Su Yu… I saw

If the human race was truly gone, the Human Emperor and the others would have lost all hope. At that point, it would have been a desperate struggle. Right now, they were also afraid, unsure if the human race had truly been annihilated, but they knew that the Myriad Realms had gone to war, and many had died.

The Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether Races had all suffered heavy losses, but among the Divine, Immortal, and Devil races, rulers of laws had been born. The crucial point was… they were all still alive!

The Dragon and Phoenix also had them!

This was very good news!

Although they didn't know the exact situation in the Myriad Realms, if the human race had gained the upper hand, those rulers of laws might have died. If they had died, there would have been some faint sensation.

Currently, the sensation was very faint, but it was certain that they were still alive!

As the powerful experts spoke, a group of experts on the Myriad Race Continent stood ready for battle!

Be careful!

The human race on the other side might go mad.

At this moment, they didn't really wish for the human race to be truly annihilated. Otherwise, if these people went mad, disregarding everything and slaughtering in all directions, even if they won, there would still be losses.

…

Human Race Continent.

The Human Emperor's phantom trembled, and a voice echoed: "Radiant King, do not stir up trouble!"

The Radiant King's aura receded. The next moment, the War King's aura surged, and he suddenly roared in fury: "Just fight them! I've had enough!"

"War King!"

The Human Emperor's grand voice resonated once more: "Calm yourselves!"

"I… never mind!"

The War King's stifled voice faded, while on the opposing side, the atmosphere grew even more solemn.

Today, the War King and the Radiant King had spoken one after another, and the Human Emperor's final words, merely "Calm yourselves!", seemed deeply meaningful.

Was a great war… truly about to erupt?

At this moment, even the powerful experts on the Human Race Continent wore extremely solemn expressions!

Had something happened in the rear?

But… Xingyue had said before that the human race held the advantage!

It couldn't be, could it?

For a time, the human race's side also grew solemn. A storm was brewing, and on both continents, hundreds of powerful experts felt an immense weight.

A great war was on the verge of breaking out!

At this moment, the Myriad Races didn't particularly want to fight, but they couldn't be sure if the human race… would want to fight?

If the human race wanted to fight, then they would be doing so with a death wish, intending to drag others down with them in their final moments.

Otherwise, with their limited number of rulers of laws, there was no reason for the human race to proactively initiate a war.

At this, several top experts from the Myriad Races quickly gathered to discuss this crucial matter: Was it merely the Human Emperor's deterrence, or was there truly an intent to fight?
