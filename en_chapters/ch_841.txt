Chapter 841: Dark Clouds Looming

The general direction was agreed upon, but the specifics still needed time to be ironed out. For a first meeting, the conversation had already exceeded expectations, leaving both parties quite satisfied. Thus, Su Yu and the Human Emperor decided to continue their discussions at a later date, as both needed to prepare.

Just as they were about to leave, they heard the Great Ming King exclaim in surprise from afar, "Ancestor, Grandmother is still alive?"

"Ancestor, you wouldn't believe it, but every year during the festivals, our family pays respects to our ancestors, and you're always included!"

"Ancestor, ever since I found out you're still alive, I've changed my name to Little Ming King. Had I known earlier, I wouldn't have dared to call myself the Great Ming King. That would have been disrespectful!"

The conversation was lively, with the Great Ming King being the main speaker. Compared to Xia Longwu's stern demeanor and his lack of courtesy towards the Battle King, the Great Ming King was excessively polite to the Radiant King.

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and the Human Emperor had a knowing smile. Goodness! The Zhu family's upbringing is truly remarkable!

At this moment, the Great Ming King continued joyfully, "Ancestor, our Zhu family has thrived over the years. I've nurtured a large group of Daofuse cultivators for you. Unfortunately, they're all lacking resources. Otherwise, they could all become rulers of laws and come to visit you!"

The Radiant King was actually a bit bewildered. How many generations had it been? Was this level of enthusiasm really necessary?

"I heard that after you took charge of logistics here, you might not know this, but your great-great-grandson started in logistics too. I see you're working hard, Ancestor. Do you need any help? I can lend a hand... Our family has a tradition in this field. Even Emperor Yu's logistics are managed by me... I'm quite skilled at this!"

At this point, even the Human Emperor chuckled, casting a meaningful glance at Su Yu. What are you planning? Coming here and immediately wanting to take over my logistics?

Although they were all supreme beings and rulers of laws, after so many years of battle, resources had become quite scarce. Cultivation, recovery, healing... of course, everyone still had some good items on hand. High-grade weapons, the corpses of powerful beings, insights into the Great Dao, and even the seized rules of the Dao! These treasures were mostly communal now, managed collectively.

The Great Ming King understood that after years of fighting without replenishment, these treasures would be centrally managed, a necessity in the later stages of military warfare. He knew the Radiant King must be in charge of a vast amount of treasures!

After years of battle, many strong beings of the myriad races had died. Where did their corpses go? What about their weapons? Their Dao insights? Their blood essence? Surely, they must exist!

So, at this moment, the Great Ming King was joyfully acknowledging his ancestor, looking down on Xia Longwu, who was foolish enough to draw a blade against his ancestor. How foolish! Now, he's like a wooden puppet. Indeed, the Xia family is lacking; the Zhu family is superior!

At this moment, the Radiant King was also taken aback by his enthusiasm, feeling a bit speechless. What should I do? Should I accept this? My great-great-grandson wants to assist me with logistics. If this continues, I might as well retire. My countless descendants can handle the Human Emperor's affairs!

"No need, I can manage..."

"How can that be! If outsiders hear about this, they'll think your descendants are unfilial. Grandmother is still around. Ancestor, when you have time, I'd like to meet Grandmother, pay my respects. Our Zhu family values tradition and etiquette!"

The Great Ming King was genuinely polite and filial, wanting to pay respects to his grandmother. The Radiant King felt exhausted!

Meanwhile, the Battle King bared his teeth, suddenly feeling fortunate. My Xia family descendants... well, they're not very tactful, but compared to the Zhu family, they're just fine. I like it. My Xia family men should be like this!

Fortunately, Lord Xiahou wasn't present; otherwise, the Battle King might not have been so pleased. Beside him, Xia Longwu maintained a stiff expression, saying nothing. He looked down on the Zhu family's shamelessness but felt a tinge of envy... because, at this moment, the Radiant King was so overwhelmed by the Great Ming King's politeness that he eventually gave a meeting gift. The Great Ming King was, after all, a ruler of laws, and giving a poor gift would be disgraceful!

Thus, the Radiant King presented a formation disk. As soon as it appeared, it shimmered with light, causing the river to tremble slightly. Clearly, it was a genuine treasure!

In the back, Su Yu was amused! The Human Emperor was also amused, "That's a good item. It's a formation disk the Radiant King has used for years, with stabilizing effects! It can stabilize the river, the heavens and earth, the Sea of Stars... He used this formation to raise the Sea of Stars! It can even stabilize the sea of will! I didn't expect him to give it away today. This guy is usually stingy. It seems... bloodline inheritance has its pros and cons!"

He wanted to laugh, seeing the Radiant King looking a bit embarrassed and wanting to escape. This wasn't something that could be resolved with wisdom. When someone calls you ancestor, is filial and enthusiastic, and genuinely wants to help... what can you do? Scold them? Hit them? Curse them? It's not appropriate!

Even knowing they're here for benefits, you can't help but feel embarrassed not to give something!

Su Yu also laughed, his smile bright, "The Great Ming King is just filial, can't help it!"

With that, Su Yu walked over, smiling, "Great Ming King, stop pestering the Radiant King! Look at General Longwu, he's much more disciplined. Honest people suffer losses. I haven't seen General Longwu pestering the Battle King, saying, 'Ancestor, that blade of yours is amazing, give it to me?' General Longwu wouldn't say that!"

The Battle King's mouth twitched! No, I want to leave! Don't mess around; that blade... can't be given away! Besides, my unworthy descendant previously attacked me; how can I give it to him? Ha! No way!

Su Yu didn't mind, casually smiling, "Everyone, calm down. The ancestors here didn't abandon us on purpose; they were fighting on the front lines! We've been through hardships in the rear, growing up without fathers, without mothers' love, struggling through life, but we made it, didn't we? We've endured for a hundred thousand years, and now we're here to embarrass ourselves!"

Su Yu sighed, then quickly smiled, "When you have time, go pay respects to the ancestors. Don't dwell on the past! The myriad races besieged us, causing human heads to roll. Let's not talk about it anymore... If you're suffering, endure it! We're all adults, not children, can't always rely on the ancestors!"

"General Longwu, don't learn from the Great Ming King. When you were young, your father died in battle, and at a young age, you were besieged by the myriad races. When you proved your Dao to become Eternal, the Sunmoon Realm, the myriad races sent seventy to eighty Eternals to kill you... That's a battle achievement, a medal, not because of the Battle King that you were hunted like this..."

The Battle King's expression changed, awkwardly saying, "That's... not possible, right? A single Sunmoon, hunted by so many?"

Was it really that bad? It felt like they were exaggerating! Was it really that pitiful?

Xia Longwu remained calm, seeing the Battle King looking over, his mouth twitching slightly, "No... His Majesty exaggerated! Forty to fifty Eternals, not just hunting me alone. That day, His Majesty was only at the Shanhai Realm. If not for His Majesty's rescue, I would have died long ago. His Majesty had it harder than me!"

The Battle King stiffened, really hunted? The Human Emperor was also slightly surprised, looking at Su Yu. Su Yu chuckled, "What was hard for me? I got used to it long ago! Back in the Great Xia Prefecture, I slaughtered all around. During my Nurturing stage, I dared to kill Sunmoon cultivators, let alone when I reached Shanhai... Forget it, let's not talk about the past!"

The Battle King awkwardly considered, should I give something? But I have nothing to give, I'm poor! After thinking for a moment, he chuckled dryly, "Treasures are external things... I see your blade Dao isn't weak. How about... I give you some of my insights into the blade Dao, you... you take a look..."

Feeling awkward again, he quickly recorded some of his insights into the blade Dao and gave them to Xia Longwu. This time, Xia Longwu was interested, not refusing, but also feeling awkward. After a while, he muttered, "Thank you... Ancestor!"

It was hard to say!

The Battle King was awkward, Xia Longwu was awkward, the Radiant King was awkward, but the Great Ming King laughed heartily, like a child, affectionately holding the Radiant King's hand. The Radiant King didn't know where to put his hands and feet, casting a pleading look at the Human Emperor!

My heavens! Your Majesty, save me! Let's go back! My several-hundred-year-old great-great-grandson... holding me, I'm so embarrassed!

The Human Emperor was also amused, coughing lightly, smiling, "Su Yu, you all... stay here for a while. We can't stay away for too long, and neither can the Battle King... Xingyue, stay here and chat with everyone. We'll discuss further later!"

Su Yu smiled, "Then, Your Majesty, take care. This matter indeed requires further discussion!"

"Then... farewell for now!"

The Human Emperor also felt a bit uneasy under the gaze of others. At this moment, many people were looking at him, not sure what they meant, but he knew it was best to leave quickly!

Soon, the three of them didn't wait for others to speak and left swiftly! Slightly embarrassed! The Battle King, who had been beaten before, wasn't this embarrassed. At this moment, he was extremely awkward, time to run!

And the Radiant King, usually calm and composed, wished he could leave immediately today!

...

After they left, the Great Ming King waved, reluctantly, smiling, "Ancestor, I'll visit you and Grandmother later. Grandmother, don't be so polite, one meeting gift is enough, I won't take a second one!"

He almost said, I definitely want a second one, hurry up and prepare it!

Xia Longwu, feeling stiff, saw the Great Ming King looking at him, his mouth twitching, unable to say the same thing. I have my pride!

After the three left, everyone suddenly laughed. The Great Qin King also said in exasperation, "You... truly shameless!"

Great Ming King sneered, "Fool, it's your fault for not having a powerful ancestor! Look at this formation disk... what a treasure! I think if I stabilize my sea of will, even a third-tier ruler of laws can't break me! I can withstand a hit from a third-tier ruler and strike back to kill him. It's like having extra lives, you know nothing!"

Great Qin King was left speechless.

Su Yu chuckled, not paying much attention. It was a good item, but it wouldn't have a significant impact on the overall battle. Otherwise, the Radiant King wouldn't have given it away. They were all shrewd individuals, exchanging pleasantries and forming connections, but that was about it.

Separated by too many generations, there was no real familial affection, but there was a sense of closeness due to shared bloodlines. Moreover, for the Battle King and others, not much time had passed here. A thousand years of constant fighting had fostered some familial bonds, though they weren't direct descendants. If Xuelan met the Snow King, the Snow King would probably be very excited, though it was uncertain if the Snow King was still alive.

At this moment, after some laughter and banter, everyone quieted down and looked at Su Yu. It seemed like Su Yu had a good conversation with the other side. How did it go?

Wan Tiansheng asked, "Your Majesty, does the Human Emperor want us to join forces directly, or is there another plan?"

If it was just to join forces, keeping them here didn't seem right. Was there another plan?

Su Yu looked at everyone, remained silent for a moment, and then spoke softly, "Before coming here, I told everyone that this is a fierce battle, a battle to the death. We're not here to make small talk with the Human Emperor or reminisce about old times!"

Everyone's hearts tightened.

Su Yu continued calmly, "Now, there are two choices: wait! Wait for this place to overlap with the Myriad Realms... At that time, when the Three Gates open and chaos ensues, we might rise amidst the turmoil. Of course, there are many variables, and nothing will be under our control!"

"The second option is to take the initiative!"

At this moment, everyone understood! Su Yu wouldn't choose the first option; otherwise, he wouldn't have come. So, in reality, there was only one choice: to take the initiative.

They just didn't expect it to be so soon, faster than they could have imagined! It was only the first day! Su Yu hadn't even joined forces with the Human Emperor, hadn't rested, and had only met the Human Emperor for the first time. They barely knew each other, yet he was already talking about taking the initiative.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng was extremely serious, "Your Majesty means... we... should join forces with the Human Emperor and launch an attack together?"

Su Yu nodded.

Everyone grew more serious, but soon, Great Qin King forced a smile and said, "Then let's do it! To be honest, over the years, we've fought north and south, and we're not afraid of battle! With a command from Your Majesty... even if we have to self-destruct, we can make sure the enemy can't handle it!"

"Let's do it!"

Heavendoom shouted, "Your Majesty, we came here to fight, not to reminisce. Giant Axe can go find the Snow King to catch up, maybe there'll be some unexpected gains..."

Beside him, Giant Axe's eyes were unfriendly. Xuelan's gaze was icy. Heavendoom... his mouth was too loose!

Heavendoom, unconcerned, said, "In a battle, we might die, so why leave regrets? Giant Axe, I support you!"

Xuelan's gaze was icy, almost freezing, while Giant Axe stroked his big beard... Really? Could this work?

Beside him, Xuelan's expression changed suddenly, looking at Giant Axe. Do you want to be my father?

Giant Axe, caught by her gaze, instantly changed his expression, becoming serious and angry, "Heavendoom, do you want to die?"

Heavendoom grinned!

Giant Axe scolded, snorted, and smiled at Xuelan, "Don't misunderstand, he's just talking nonsense. I didn't mean it!"

But... sometimes Heavendoom made sense. After today, would there be a tomorrow?

Su Yu, this emperor, was crazy. If he wanted to take the initiative, maybe there really wouldn't be a tomorrow after today. Should I... give it a try?

Giant Axe pondered silently!

At this moment, the Undead Emperor also stepped forward and said softly, "Your Majesty, how did you and the Human Emperor discuss this? And who are our opponents, and how strong are they?"

"Thirty rulers of laws!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Of course, that's not certain! There could be more, or fewer. Who can be sure once the battle starts? Generally speaking, that's about it! And among them... there must be a first-tier!"

At this, the Martial Emperor gasped, "First-tier? Honestly, first-tier is really strong! I once saw the Culture King strike, killing a ruler of laws with a single stroke!"

"The ruler of laws that was killed wasn't weak. According to today's standards, it was either a weak third-tier or a strong fourth-tier! Yet the Culture King killed him with a single stroke!"

He had seen it with his own eyes! So, even though he feared nothing, he was somewhat wary of the Culture King. After the Culture King killed the opponent, he even glanced at the hidden Martial Emperor, who was actually quite afraid of the Culture King.

He cursed the Martial King like that, but he never dared to curse the Culture King, at most calling Taishan and his group... just that group!

Don't be fooled by Su Yu's group killing five rulers of laws before. That was in Su Yu's world, where those guys were suppressed, and they had an advantage, while the opponents were weakened.

So, it was much easier to kill them. In a normal encounter outside, killing a ruler of laws was still very difficult.

The Culture King and the Human Emperor, in that era, surpassed everyone, so there was always debate about who was stronger in the Myriad Realms, the Culture King or the Human Emperor?

Who was stronger?

To this day, no one has given a definitive answer!

And now, they were going to deal with a first-tier!

Su Yu, however, smiled, "Not everyone is the Culture King. First-tier also has strong and weak. The Culture King and the Human Emperor may have surpassed first-tier, so killing strong ones was easy, but that doesn't mean the Myriad Races' first-tier is the same! Just now, the Radiant King was first-tier, according to the Human Emperor's words, based on the division of the power of laws, first-tier starts at 16 paths of power... so the opponent is probably just entering first-tier!"

Sixteen paths count as first-tier. Eight to fifteen paths are second-tier. Su Yu, outside, wasn't considered strong, probably around nine paths, he judged himself so, but in his own world, Su Yu felt he had at least fourteen paths of power.

The Martial Emperor, probably about the same, nine paths of power. As for the Battle King, he should be top-tier, outside probably similar to Su Yu in his world, but Su Yu couldn't judge precisely, as the Battle King hadn't used the power of laws before.

Thus, if he joined forces with the Battle King and the Martial Emperor to deal with a 16-path strong one... outside, it was hard to say, even if they won, it would be a bitter struggle, but within the world, suppressing the opponent to 15 paths would suffice, and Su Yu and the Battle King together had a chance to kill a first-tier!

So, if this battle were to happen... they must lure the opponent into their world's radiation range!

Otherwise, it couldn't be fought, and even if they won, it would be a pyrrhic victory!

That wouldn't be necessary!

Using 20 rulers of laws to exchange for 30 of theirs, some might think it's a big gain, but for Su Yu, it would be a huge loss!

Su Yu said softly, "A battle must be fought! I like to hold the initiative, deciding when the battle breaks out! We choose the battlefield! Taking the initiative is definitely better than being passive! Being passive means only defending!"

"Of course, there are benefits for us now!"

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "First, the opponent doesn't understand us, they don't even know we exist! Second, if we can lure them into a trap... we have the absolute advantage of time, place, and people! Third, we must show our strength in one battle, so the human predecessors know our power, to avoid trouble later. If the Human Emperor really falls, and those old predecessors don't listen, can we really kill them? Now, let's show some strength..."

Everyone was speechless!

The Human Emperor fell again?

Why do you keep thinking the Human Emperor will fall? That's not good!

Su Yu looked calm and said, "If I say he'll fall, he'll fall. What, not happy? If not happy, go find the Human Emperor!"

He needed to prepare them!

In case something went wrong, and the Human Emperor was revealed to be seriously injured, causing panic!

Sure enough, Wan Tiansheng's eyes moved slightly, "Is Your Majesty planning to act with the Human Emperor, making him pretend to be on the verge of falling, to lure the enemy in?"

Su Yu said indifferently, "What if he really falls? What act!"

Goodness, they understood, acting!

Even if you deny it, we know!

Got it!

Everyone looked at each other, understanding without speaking. Su Yu and the Human Emperor had reached an agreement, with the Human Emperor pretending to be seriously injured and on the verge of falling, to lure the enemy in. As for how to lure them, that wasn't their concern.

Alright, everyone understood!

Heavendoom laughed, "Got it, even if we see the Human Emperor fall, we must remain calm, not lose our composure... understood, we all understand Your Majesty's intentions!"

Rest assured!

And Su Yu smiled, showing an approving look. Heavendoom was overjoyed, thinking he was so clever, instantly grasping His Majesty's intentions.

Very good!

At this moment, others also smiled, but Wan Tiansheng looked at Su Yu, saying nothing.

The Human Emperor fell... Su Yu had said it more than once.

Once or twice could be a joke.

But saying it too much... on one hand, it seemed disrespectful to the predecessors, on the other, it seemed like cursing the Human Emperor. Su Yu shouldn't have any ill feelings toward the Human Emperor, so there was no need to keep joking like this.

Acting... there might be that aspect.

But... what if it's true?

Wan Tiansheng didn't dare think deeply!

Thinking about it made him afraid.

Fear!

The Human Emperor is currently the strongest of the human race, the pillar. Su Yu couldn't achieve that yet. With less than half the rulers of laws, they were resisting the Myriad Races, all because of the Human Emperor!

He is the emperor!

The leader, both in strength and spirit. If the Human Emperor truly died, Heavendoom and others might not care much, but those ancient kings would go mad, completely losing confidence!

Before this, Su Yu, in their eyes, really had no presence!

Wan Tiansheng was pondering, was this battle Su Yu's idea or the Human Emperor's?

The purpose of the battle, was it simply to weaken the myriad races, or was it to give Su Yu a chance to stand before everyone, to let the ancient powerhouses know that even if the Human Emperor perished, there was still someone who could rise up?

Wan Tiansheng pondered over this deeply.

...

Meanwhile.

The Human Emperor, War King, and Radiant King were walking together. Suddenly, the Human Emperor chuckled and asked, "Old Zhu, what do you think of Su Yu?"

Radiant King considered for a moment before replying, "I haven't interacted with him much, nor do I know him deeply. But seeing the fierce and proud warriors under his command, each one of them holds him in high regard. Su Yu... is not simple! For someone so young to command such respect from these people, it's not something an ordinary person can achieve! I even had a brief chat with the Martial Emperor, casually mentioning Su Yu... The Martial Emperor's expression was a bit stiff, showing anger and embarrassment, yet not overly so... It felt like he was subdued but not entirely convinced, yet had to concede."

He was a shrewd person!

With just a few words, he could infer a lot.

He continued, "I know people like Giant Axe and Wu Ji. I chatted with them briefly. Wu Ji was once under the command of the ninth-generation Human Lord, Hundred Battle King, and only later joined Su Yu. Despite the short time, I noticed Wu Ji has some fear and respect for Su Yu! As for Giant Axe, he seems more admiring, even somewhat worshipful!"

"For a warrior to worship someone... it's not simple, especially since Giant Axe isn't a child but a strong marquis from our era, and even he was won over by Su Yu!"

The Human Emperor nodded slightly, smiling, "I looked at the composition of his subordinates: Iron Devourer Race, Hou Race, Fate Clan... The Fate Clan is usually quite aloof, yet now they obediently await his command! There are marquises from our time and the new generation... So many different races and forces, all subdued and suppressed by him. Su Yu is indeed extraordinary!"

Sometimes, you can tell a lot just by looking.

The Human Emperor wasn't a fool!

To bet the future of the human race entirely on Su Yu with just a few words would be madness!

He observed, assessed, and largely deduced Su Yu's character, strength, methods, style, intelligence, and wisdom...

He was good at judging people.

Even though he had been tricked a few times, he knew it was something to expect.

The Human Emperor spoke a few words, then fell silent for a while before saying, "Over the years, my injuries haven't improved; they've only worsened!"

Before the War King could speak, the Radiant King sighed, "Your Majesty... Brother Xing, are you... planning to take a gamble? Su Yu is still too weak!"

He smiled bitterly, "If you really want to gamble... Brother, leave it to me. Perhaps I can be more reassuring than him? His strength isn't even on par with mine!"

He had no intention of seizing power; it was meaningless!

He just wasn't confident!

Really not confident!

Too bold!

With him around, at least the forces could be stabilized.

The Human Emperor laughed, "You are strong, and your mind is sharp, but you... cannot be a leader! Old Zhu, we've been brothers for many years, so let me be blunt: you're good at maintaining, but when faced with a crisis, a difficult situation... you might be able to lead everyone to escape, but you can't turn the tide in a desperate situation!"

The Human Emperor sighed, "Otherwise, I wouldn't leave my old brothers unused, hoping for a newcomer! I never rely on others; I only want to rely on myself to suppress everything, to sweep away everything! But... haha..."

The Human Emperor laughed, somewhat helplessly, "Now, I have to prepare for this! While I still have some strength, while I can still fight a battle, I'll see, test, and observe... If I delay, I'm afraid I won't even have this chance!"

The War King grumbled, "Brother, are your injuries really that severe?"

The Human Emperor smiled, "Injuries of the Great Dao! Severe physical trauma! Now... if there's no great battle, no crisis, I could try to sever my Dao, sever my Human Emperor Dao, sever my new world... I could try to recover and then continue! But it's not possible; if I make a big move, everyone will sense it, and then, I'm doomed!"

He couldn't sever it!

If he did, it would mean the crisis had reached its peak!

At this moment, both the War King and Radiant King looked extremely grim.

The Radiant King said in a low voice, "So, Brother's intention is to test Su Yu, to see if he has the ability to support the human race? Then, Old Xia and I will support him?"

The Human Emperor was silent for a moment, then nodded, "What I value is not anything else, but his ability to turn the tide in desperate situations! I have some understanding of him in the Myriad Realms; he turned the tide in desperate situations, using weak forces to leverage the entire Myriad Realms! He quelled the calamity of the Myriad Realms and brought over 30 rulers of laws to aid... The key is, he has potential. Old Zhu, you are first-rate, but can you surpass him? It's too difficult! He has hope! He is an opener, not only that, but he is also an opener who progresses incredibly fast!"

The Radiant King fell silent.

The Human Emperor continued, "Rest assured, I won't die so easily, nor will I bet everything on him the first time we meet, the first battle... But if he can truly achieve it, fulfill our agreement, then he has the ability to suppress everything, including our old brothers... No matter how proud, how fierce, one must maintain enough confidence and respect for such a person!"

Age is not a capital for arrogance!

At this time, if a strong person capable of reversing the situation appears, no matter how old they are, they deserve respect and anticipation!

If you can't see through it... The Human Emperor said softly, "If you can't see through this, then it was all for nothing! A true warrior should respect the strong, admire the strong, and listen! Smart people can see through things! And if a smart person sees through it and still wants to cause trouble... then they have ulterior motives. If such a person is truly suppressed, or whatever... you two shouldn't step in!"

The old brothers had followed him for too many years. He believed that those who survived until now, whether they were reckless or smart, wise or not, wouldn't be too foolish or stupid when the time came!

And those who caused trouble... they shouldn't be bothered with, either because they were unclear or because they were idiots, or because they had other issues.

Such people, he wouldn't feel bad about clearing them out.

After all, he might not have the chance to see it.

"Brother!"

The War King said solemnly, "You're speaking too pessimistically, too despairingly! Brother, how many years have we followed you in battle? Are you now going to abandon your brothers and go off on your own? If Su Yu doesn't come, are you going to leave on your own? Abandon your brothers?"

The Human Emperor laughed, "Don't talk about me, that old dog Wen ran away first, that fool Taishan followed him, leaving a big mess behind. I wanted to hold it up... but, alas!"

With a sigh, he shook his head, then quickly laughed, "No need to be too pessimistic. I'm used to being the big brother, I don't like being the little brother! I've been the big brother for too many years... but... if it really comes to it... Old Xia aside, Old Zhu... endure it, even being a grandson is possible!"

He laughed, "I don't like being a grandson, and Su Yu... might not be the type to be a grandson either. Young people, full of vigor! You're old, old, your temper should be better. If the Three Gates truly open, being a grandson once, so what?"

The Radiant King forced a smile, didn't respond, and instead changed the topic, "So what did Brother say to Su Yu?"

"Fight a battle! Weigh his worth!"

The Human Emperor said solemnly, "I want him to deal with 30 rulers of laws, first-rate ones! I want to see his battle damage ratio, see his methods against opponents! I will try to control the opponent's strength to be on par! Isn't he bringing 36 rulers of laws? Try to maintain balance... Even if he loses, with the nature of the myriad races, they won't fight to the death, his losses won't be too great! But if he loses, or wins miserably, then I... will have to reconsider!"

What he needed was a hero, not a reckless fool, not an idiot who exchanges one for one!

If everything is exhausted, what comes next?

Both the War King and Radiant King took a deep breath, 30, first-rate!

This... is really not easy to deal with!

Can those people do it?

Have they fought against rulers of laws before?

Do they understand the combat methods of rulers of laws?

Can they fight on a large-scale battlefield of rulers of laws?

They lack such experience!

And Su Yu, he's too young!

Suddenly, both of them became extremely serious, "Brother, if the myriad races don't retreat... these people will be in danger!"

"No worries!"

The Human Emperor smiled, "I won't let them suffer heavy losses all at once... that wouldn't meet my expectations! If it really doesn't work... just continue the standoff! Even if the myriad races know we're strong, as long as I act like... if I'm not dead, they still won't dare to act recklessly!"

As long as I'm alive, I'm a deterrent!

Not dead, I'm a deterrent!

Absolute confidence!

Confidence from being the number one in the heavens!

In the past, when I unified the world, which of those bastards dared to speak loudly?

A fallen tiger still has its might!

As long as I, Xingyu, am not dead, the heavens will not be chaotic, nor can they be!

At this moment, the Human Emperor was unparalleled in his dominance, sneering coldly, "Even if I die, these bastards will die of fright, and they won't have the strength to deal with us again!"

At this moment, the War King and Radiant King seemed to return to the past!

Conquering the world, sweeping all directions!

Invincible with me!

With the Human Emperor, there is invincibility!

At this moment, the Radiant King's aura shook, and in the distance, his true body roared again, "Your Majesty, I still can't hold back, I'm going to deal with those bastards!"

"......"

At this moment, on the opposite continent, a group of strong individuals was speechless.

Usually, it's fine if the War King is impulsive.

But what's up with the Radiant King today?

Several times!

Who are you trying to scare?

Or is it that something really big happened to the human race, and they sensed that several rulers of laws were born among the myriad races, could it be that the human race was destroyed?

If so... haha, no wonder the Radiant King couldn't hold back!

If the human race is destroyed, then dragging it out to the end is useless. At this moment, a grand voice spread across the continent, "Everyone, be on guard. If the human race is truly destroyed, those guys on the other side might go crazy! Be careful of their desperation!"

Be a little more cautious!

The human race was truly gone, and the Human Emperor and the others had lost hope. At that moment, they were embroiled in a fierce battle. Now, they were afraid, unsure if the human race was truly annihilated, but they knew that the Myriad Realms were at war, and many had perished.

The Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether Races had all suffered heavy losses. However, the Divine, Immortal, and Devil races had rulers of laws emerge, and crucially... they were all still alive! Even the Dragons and Phoenixes had them!

This was indeed very favorable news!

Although the exact situation in the Myriad Realms was unknown, if the human race held the advantage, those rulers of laws might have died, and their deaths would have been sensed to some extent. Currently, the sense was very faint, but it was certain that they were still alive!

With the words of the powerful, a group of strong individuals on the Myriad Race Continent stood ready and vigilant!

Be cautious!

The humans on the other side might go mad.

At this moment, they didn't really hope for the complete annihilation of the human race. Otherwise, if these people went crazy, killing indiscriminately, even if they won, there would be losses.

...

On the Human Race Continent.

The phantom of the Human Emperor trembled, and a voice echoed, "Radiant King, do not stir up trouble!"

The aura of the Radiant King receded, and the next moment, the aura of the Battle King surged, suddenly furious, "Let's just fight them, I've had enough!"

"Battle King!"

The grand voice of the Human Emperor echoed again, "Stay calm!"

"I... forget it!"

The aggrieved voice of the Battle King disappeared, while on the opposite side, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

Today, both the Battle King and the Radiant King had spoken, and the Human Emperor's final words were merely "stay calm," which seemed quite meaningful.

Could it be... that a great war was truly about to erupt?

At this moment, even on the Human Race Continent, those powerful individuals were all extremely solemn!

Did something happen at the rear?

But... Xingyue had previously said that the human race held the advantage!

It shouldn't be, right?

For a moment, the human side also grew somewhat solemn, as if a storm was brewing. On both continents, hundreds of powerful beings felt an immense weight.

A great war was on the verge of breaking out!

At this moment, the myriad races did not really want to fight, yet they couldn't be sure if the humans... wanted to fight.

If the humans wanted to fight, then they were determined to die, dragging others down with them.

Otherwise, with the few rulers of laws the humans had, there was no reason for them to initiate a war.

Now, on the side of the myriad races, several top-tier powerhouses quickly gathered to discuss the major issue. Was it the deterrence of the Human Emperor, or was there truly an intention to fight?
