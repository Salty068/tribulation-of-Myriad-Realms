Chapter 864: The Three Gates

Su Yu and the Human Emperor walked side by side, advancing toward the Myriad Realms. Behind them, numerous powerful figures followed. Many looked at them as if seeing the Culture King and the Human Emperor of old. Now, with the Culture King having entered the Heaven Gate, the Human Emperor had fought alone for many years, and his old subordinates felt a sense of nostalgia.

The arrival of Su Yu was perhaps a great joy for the Human Emperor. For a powerful being, the greatest fear was loneliness, the isolation of having the world as one's enemy.

...

At this moment, the Human Emperor wore a smile, his hands clasped behind his back. As he walked, he asked, "Next, do you plan to rely on the Heaven Gate to restore your power of the world?"

He paused to consider before continuing, "Using the Heaven Gate too much might not be a good thing. The stronger the projection of the Heaven Gate, the more likely top-tier experts will use your Heaven Gate's shadow to cause trouble for you!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling. "Let's see first."

Then, Su Yu added, "Your Majesty, if the Three Gates open, they shouldn't be united. I have some understanding of the Heaven Gate and the Earth Gate, but what did the Immortal Emperor say about the Human Gate?"

Su Yu had only heard a little and missed the rest.

The Human Emperor sighed softly, "He said the Human Gate is the most complex and treacherous... As for its strength, even he doesn't know. But he mentioned that the Human Gate might have long been laying plans, sowing discord among the myriad races, with the Human Gate's influence behind it."

The Human Emperor pondered for a moment before continuing, "Whether it's the Control King, your so-called Hundred Battle King, or even the Human Ancestor, they might all have some connection to the Human Gate. Among the myriad races, some powerful beings have also had contact with the Human Gate."

Su Yu frowned slightly. He truly had little information about the Human Gate. Hearing this, he asked, "What kind of beings exist within the Human Gate? This so-called Human Gate... could it be that humans are inside?"

The Human Emperor shook his head, "Currently, our understanding of the Human Gate is minimal. We don't know its strength, realms, or numbers, and we can't delve deeper because it's downstream of the River of Time... Logically speaking, it's in the future!"

The Human Emperor chuckled bitterly, "In other words, if you want to find the Human Gate, by the time you see it, the world outside might have changed drastically!"

Past, future, present.

Su Yu fell into contemplation. Among the Three Gates, the Heaven Gate is upstream of the River of Time—does that mean it's the past? The Human Gate is downstream, representing the future? As for the Earth Gate... it exists parallel to the Myriad Realms, so is it the present?

The past is singular, the present is singular, but the future is unpredictable.

If judged this way, the Human Gate is indeed unfathomable and too mysterious. Although the Hundred Battle King and others opened the Human Gate, Su Yu knew nothing about the specifics. The Human Ancestor's side should have some connection to the Human Gate, including Zhou Ji.

Su Yu didn't dwell on it further; there was too little information to think of anything substantial.

Seeing him shake his head, the Human Emperor smiled, "Don't worry too much! I've never feared the Three Gates. If the strong within the Three Gates were truly powerful, they wouldn't have been sealed! What I truly worry about is the master of the River of Time. This being is truly mysterious, powerful, and unfathomable!"

Su Yu frowned, "Does Your Majesty know anything about this being?"

"Not at all!"

The Human Emperor laughed, "Such an existence is terrifying! Everyone knows of him, everyone cultivates within his world, yet no one knows anything about him—whether he's male or female, human or ghost. He's everywhere, and compared to him, what are the Three Gates?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, agreeing with the Human Emperor's words.

The Human Emperor continued, "The Three Gates will probably open soon. You just felt it too; the river has started to surge. At this rate, in about ten years of the Myriad Realms' time, the Three Gates will fully open!"

Ten years. If Su Yu doesn't interfere or actively open the Upper Realm, ten years would coincide with the time for the Upper Realm to open and the Martial Emperor to break his seal.

Everything would unfold in ten years.

At that time, the Three Gates will open, the Upper Realm will open, the powerful will break their seals, and the Human Emperor will return...

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Will it really be ten years? Now that many of the myriad races have died, and the number of strong ones has halved, if we leave, the pressure will be less than before."

Previously, the strong ones in the River of Time acted as a form of suppression, delaying the opening of the Three Gates. Now, although the human strong ones have increased, the myriad races have decreased significantly. With Su Yu and the Human Emperor returning, will there still be ten years?

The Human Emperor calculated and said, "There will be at least five or six years, at the minimum. So, we have at least five or six years to accumulate strength."

Su Yu considered for a moment and nodded, "At least one or two years to accumulate strength."

The Human Emperor wanted to say, are you hearing things?

I said five or six years!

Su Yu continued, "Maybe even less!"

"..."

The Human Emperor was speechless. Are you so badly injured from the battle that your brain is waterlogged?

I said at least five or six years!

Su Yu went on, "When the Three Gates open, it won't be good. We should actively enter one gate and attack it. If our people withdraw, it might quickly lead to the Three Gates opening, so... maybe just one or two years!"

The Human Emperor finally understood his meaning and couldn't help but laugh.

This kid is truly ruthless.

It's rare to see someone like Su Yu, who actively wants to attack the Three Gates.

Others, upon hearing of the past era and the gathering of countless strong ones, would feel some anxiety and fear when mentioning the Three Gates. But Su Yu seems to know no fear.

"Do you have a plan?"

He looked at Su Yu, who nodded, "The Earth Gate!"

The Human Emperor raised an eyebrow slightly, pondering for a moment before saying, "The Earth Gate is indeed the weakest of the Three Gates, but there's one thing... the Earth Gate might not be infiltrated by just us!"

"The situation in the Earth Gate is somewhat complicated!"

The Human Emperor explained, "Because the Earth Gate was opened in both the ancient and archaic times, it was very chaotic then. So, within the Earth Gate, there might even be people from the Heaven Gate and the Human Gate mixed in. They might not be their true selves, but perhaps avatars or cultivated followers."

Among the Three Gates, the Earth Gate is probably the weakest, but also the most chaotic. Not to mention, the Control King's lineage thrived inside.

Now, with Su Yu having driven Tiangu, Zhou Ji, and others inside, it might become even more chaotic.

"Chaos is good!"

Su Yu laughed, but then quickly asked, "Does the Earth Gate benefit us?"

He truly wasn't sure about this. Su Yu asked, "Is it similar to the Heaven Gate's dao paths, which can complement us? But as far as I know, the Earth Gate mostly consists of the Chaos Ancient Clan, with unclear dao powers, all being chaotic dao paths... In that case, the Earth Gate doesn't benefit us much, right? And if the Earth Gate opens, is there really much benefit?"

People from the Heaven Gate want to come out because there are significant benefits. But what about the Earth Gate?

Previously, Su Yu had also killed some Chaos Ancient Clan members from the Earth Gate. Apart from integrating them into his world to enhance it slightly, he hadn't felt any particularly significant benefits.

"There are benefits!"

The Human Emperor smiled, "We've fought the Earth Gate for many years and killed many Chaos Ancient Beasts. We do have some understanding of the Earth Gate. The benefits of the Earth Gate aren't as direct as the Heaven Gate, but killing beings from the Earth Gate is actually a process of strengthening one's origin. I'm not sure if you've experienced this."

The Human Emperor explained, "When we devour past and future selves, we either rely on carriers or can only rely on our own strength to merge past and future selves to strengthen ourselves! But the true self finds it hard to bear the three bodies! Even you and I haven't borne much... But killing strong beings from the Earth Gate is actually a process of strengthening one's true origin!"

Su Yu understood.

His eyes flickered slightly, "You mean, by killing beings from the Earth Gate, if I kill enough, for example, if I merge with a past self once and a future self once, then by killing more beings from the Earth Gate, I can continue to draw on past selves to strengthen myself?"

The past is singular, but there are many past points in time.

They can be drawn upon!

However, Su Yu himself isn't strong enough and needs carriers, but killing beings from the Earth Gate can strengthen the true self, which is entirely different!

The Human Emperor nodded, also smiling.

At this moment, both of them smiled.

Despite the smiles, the Human Emperor still said, "Although the Earth Gate is the weakest of the Three Gates, it should not be underestimated. In the past, during my era, when the Earth Gate opened, I and the second Culture King were curious about the Three Gates and wanted to explore them... I didn't go in, but the second Culture King wanted to enter the Earth Gate. However, shortly after entering, he was forced out!"

Su Yu was taken aback.

The Culture King had been to the Earth Gate?

He was quite bold!

This person was truly daring, entering both the Heaven Gate and the Earth Gate.

"That time, the one who attacked him was a powerful being from the Earth Gate, the Lord of Chaos. Of course, whether he was the master of the Chaos Era, no one knows, but he was extremely strong. The second Culture King didn't dare to fight him recklessly and chose to withdraw!"

The Human Emperor explained for a while, finally saying, "So, do you still have the same idea of entering the Earth Gate early?"

Su Yu pondered for a moment, "It's hard to say right now. I'm considering whether entering the Earth Gate would cause the Three Gates to open prematurely... or should we conduct a small-scale exploration first?"

He continued, "Moreover, I have an extremely important matter unfinished..."

"What is it?"

"Rescue!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "The Time Sage!"

This matter is crucial!

The Human Emperor was stunned, unable to help but look at Su Yu, "You..."

Su Yu exhaled, "I must save her. Her situation isn't good! I am who I am today because the Time Sage was the one who truly changed my life. Compared to the Culture King, the Time Sage is my true legacy..."

The pen dao, Su Yu only encountered briefly, but the Time Sage's Book of Time was the key to Su Yu's world-opening.

Su Yu still remembered when the Time Sage, in her sleep, vaguely gave him some information, and she was crying.

Su Yu was speechless. The Culture King wasn't dead, after all! Women and their deceitful tongues. And what about the Time Sage? Su Yu had some insights from his recent experiences. It seemed she might have been captured by some supreme being, yet not killed... or perhaps they couldn't kill her. This was another oddity.

If they knew the Culture King and Martial King weren't weak, why not just release them or kill them outright? Why give them any chance at all? This hesitation had led to the current situation where the Time Sage still lived. What were they thinking?

Moreover, when the Time Sage entered the Heaven Gate back then, it was likely a trap, or something had lured her in. She knew the risks but went anyway.

As these thoughts swirled in his mind, Su Yu spoke again, "I might head to the Heaven Gate soon. It might not be my true self, perhaps just a projection. The Human Emperor mentioned you once projected yourself there and got beaten back, is that true?"

The Human Emperor nodded, "I encountered a formidable opponent. Later, to avoid exposing my Heaven Gate's location, I stopped trying. Mainly because my projection might land right in that guy's territory, and I didn't have the energy to fight him over the years."

He looked at Su Yu and said softly, "You want to save Wenyu... that girl... she was always causing trouble back then. If you can save her, that's great. But if not... let Wen Lao Er handle it himself for now!"

Su Yu's true self couldn't enter. The Heaven Gate was easy to enter but hard to exit, making it risky. What could a mere projection achieve?

But if Su Yu wanted to go, the Human Emperor couldn't stop him. Wenyu's Book of Time had indeed greatly influenced Su Yu, and the Human Emperor could see Wenyu's shadow in Su Yu's world.

Su Yu, wanting to know more about the Time Sage, asked, "Does Your Majesty know anything about the Time Sage? How strong is she? She hasn't opened her own world, so has she connected to the power of the Great Dao?"

"Wenyu..." The Human Emperor smiled at the memory of the girl. "A very lively girl! Back then, when Wen Lao Er and I were conquering lands, she was with Xingyue. She was younger than Xingyue but far more troublesome. Xingyue was gentle, but she was not. She was always causing a ruckus!"

Talking about the Time Sage made the Human Emperor chuckle. "She was restless from a young age. When Wen Lao Er and I went out to battle, we left her and Xingyue with Wen Lao Er. Xingyue could stay put, but not her. She often sneaked out. We had killed many ancient beasts from the Earth Gate back then, and this girl ate quite a few. She was greedy and insisted on collecting materials herself to cook."

Su Yu's mouth twitched. Was this the origin of her cookbook?

The Human Emperor laughed again, "She was as talented as Wen Lao Er! Initially, Wen Lao Er and I wanted her to follow the orthodox cultivation path. Later, she, in her mischief, created the so-called Book of Time, which is essentially a cookbook."

"At that time, she had actually found her own path..."

The Human Emperor sighed, "She was indeed talented. Maybe because she saw a lot with us, she didn't want to follow the conventional path of opening and merging Daos. She said the River of Time covering the myriad realms was like a farm, and she could eat whatever she wanted... So, she wanted to open her own farm!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered.

The Human Emperor smiled, "Don't mind it. I know you'll make associations, but calling it a farm is too much. Just think about your own world. Do you treat it like a farm?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said nothing more.

The Human Emperor continued, "Later, she began perfecting her cookbook, wanting to open a world. Wen Lao Er and I supported her. At that time, we had similar thoughts, but we were different from Wenyu. We opened Daos first, then worlds!"

"Wenyu didn't open a Dao. According to her, she would directly open a world!"

Su Yu imagined it and nodded, "The Time Sage is formidable and decisive, directly opening a world and forging the Book of Time. These are impressive feats!"

The Human Emperor laughed, "She was just too restless, collecting corpses everywhere, making Wen Lao Er and I pretend not to know her. At that time, the myriad realms had just been pacified, and she was collecting corpses everywhere, which could easily provoke the myriad races. So, she didn't dare reveal her identity. Later, everyone called her the Time Sage, and she accepted it."

"If she didn't open a world, how strong was she?"

Su Yu asked, and the Human Emperor thought for a moment, "Not weak! At her peak, with the Book of Time, she might have had power close to the first tier!"

Seeing Su Yu's expression, the Human Emperor smiled, "Do you think she's not strong?"

"You must know, in that era, how many first-tier experts were there in the entire myriad realms? I, Wen Lao Er, and the Martial King barely stepped into the first tier. The Radiant King was only at the peak of the second tier then... Her strength at that time could already rank in the top ten of the myriad realms!"

The Human Emperor sighed and continued, "Later, as her Book of Time gradually improved, she also had the intention of opening a world. Her ambition wasn't small. We had long advised her to open a world early... She refused, saying the myriad Daos weren't complete, her comprehension wasn't deep enough, and she wanted to gather more Daos to open a world in one go, surpassing Wen Lao Er and me!"

Su Yu inhaled sharply, "Such ambition... truly grand! I merged her Book of Time, but I didn't think she could reach a very strong level after opening a world. However... if she opened a world herself, reaching the first tier wouldn't be a problem."

That was already terrifying!

But it didn't meet the Time Sage's expectations.

The Human Emperor smiled, "Did you think the Book of Time she sent out was the original?"

Su Yu was stunned. What did that mean?

The Human Emperor smiled, "Wenyu's core power is in the Book of Time. If she truly sent out the original and you damaged it, she would have fallen to the Sunmoon Realm long ago, wouldn't she? She might have sent out a copy or a replica."

Su Yu was taken aback.

Could it be?

The Human Emperor explained, "Wenyu is crafty. She's not the type to just cry and do nothing. She knows how to save herself. Knowing she's in danger, would she entrust all her hopes to someone else? So, your Book of Time might be a replica. You said Xing came out with the Book of Time, right?"

Su Yu nodded.

The Human Emperor smiled, "How could Xing come out with the Book of Time? If Wenyu truly used the Book of Time to break through the Heaven Gate instantly, she would have been fighting a strong enemy. How could Xing have the strength to come out with it?"

Su Yu was stunned again, partly because of the Human Emperor's words and partly because of his lack of respect for his ancestor.

The Human Emperor ignored him and continued, "So, this girl Wenyu might have her own plans. There must be a crisis, or she wouldn't have created the Book of Time. But since Wen Lao Er is still alive, Wenyu won't fall so easily."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "You mean the Time Sage has her own arrangements?"

"She certainly does."

The Human Emperor looked at Su Yu and smiled, "Aren't you one of them?"

"Me?"

Su Yu pondered, and the Human Emperor laughed, "What's wrong? Aren't you her backup plan? Look, haven't you risen?"

Su Yu smiled wryly, indeed.

"But when I saw some of her imprints, she was crying..."

The Human Emperor sighed helplessly, "That's normal. A crying child gets the milk, just trying to gain some sympathy. Wenyu would even cry a bit when collecting corpses, fake crying, mourning a bit, but never saw her eat any ancient beasts carelessly."

"......"

Su Yu gritted his teeth, speechless for a long time.

Really?

Fake crying?

Could it be?

Regarding the Culture King's sister, Su Yu was at a loss for words. After a long while, he said, "She shouldn't be living too comfortably now, right?"

"Probably not."

The Human Emperor laughed, "But she shouldn't be too miserable either, so don't let her mislead you!"

Su Yu was exasperated!

Indeed, in this day and age, playing the victim works. He had been thinking the Time Sage was about to die, crying miserably, and he needed to hurry to save her.

"Of course, these are just my speculations. Maybe she really is in danger."

The Human Emperor added, to avoid misleading Su Yu if things weren't as he thought.

Su Yu was speechless. Of course, he knew it was speculation.

...

During their conversation, the group had already arrived at the myriad realms.

Tearing through the void, Su Yu and his group entered the Upper Realm.

At this moment, Su Yu also saw the Human Emperor's world, shimmering with golden light. Some powerful beings were stationed here.

Empyrean Cloud and others hadn't followed. Seeing Su Yu and the others return, the previously vigilant experts relaxed. Empyrean Cloud hurried forward, "You scared us to death, Your Majesty. Earlier, your world was shaking, and Monitor Heaven almost fainted. Is everything alright now?"

"All good!"

Su Yu smiled, looking at the Human Emperor, "Then let's each return to our own homes. You stabilize your world, I'll stabilize mine. Let the Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables integrate into your world quickly. As for my side, I don't need them for now!"

The Human Emperor nodded, thought for a moment, and said, "Alright, if you plan to enter the Heaven Gate, let me know in advance!"

The Human Emperor said solemnly, "Don't go in silently; it's risky!"

"Got it."

Su Yu waved his hand and stepped into his own world.

Behind him, as the group was about to step in, Empyrean Cloud asked in surprise, "Dingjun, what are you doing here? Your home is with His Majesty the Human Emperor!"

"......"

Marquis Dingjun almost spat blood!

But thinking carefully, indeed, he was right. He had continued his Dao in the Human Emperor's world, so going to Su Yu's world was pointless!

For a moment, those who had integrated their Daos in the Human Emperor's world were at a loss.

The Radiant King and Zhan Wang were also helpless.

Two worlds, but now, everything was chaotic and not so distinct. They had integrated into Su Yu's world too. But the key was, they weren't very familiar with Su Yu and still had to manage major affairs in the Human Emperor's world.

For a moment, everyone was at a loss as to where to go.

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu paid no attention to these matters. After the battle, he was severely injured and needed time to heal and stabilize his world to prevent it from collapsing. Since it hadn't collapsed yet, Su Yu wouldn't let it happen willingly. Previously, he had no choice but to consider sending everything to the Human Emperor's side.

This time, although many were killed, the gains were not as significant as expected. However, there were some benefits: the Martial Emperor advanced to the first tier, the Great Zhou King reached the first tier, the Radiant King merged with the Dao, and the Hundred Battle King also merged with the Dao. Several first-tier experts emerged, and their insights into the Dao were integrated into the world. If Su Yu's world weren't damaged, it would have certainly improved. With a few more first-tier experts, the power within his world could still increase.

Su Yu entered the Human Lord Seal and began a period of recuperation. This time, it would take him at least a month to recover. A day had already passed in the upper reaches, and the three-month deadline to resolve the Myriad Races was approaching. It had been nearly three months in the Myriad Realms.

...

At this moment, both Su Yu and the Human Emperor were recuperating and recovering.

Simultaneously, preparations were underway in various places for the opening of the Three Gates.

Within the Earth Gate, deep in the chaos, the Human Emperor's previous punch had shaken the surroundings, causing the momentum of the Earth Gate to falter. The previously high morale to break out had suddenly diminished.

At this moment, a voice filled with laughter echoed from the depths, "Messenger of the Human Gate, seeking an audience with the Lord of Chaos!"

As the voice rang out, a shadowy figure appeared instantly.

The shadow, the Lord of Chaos, looked towards the periphery, at the distant figure, and spoke in an ancient, indifferent tone, "Can you represent the Human Gate?"

"Perhaps I can."

The shadow, the Lord of Chaos, replied with a hint of indifference, "What do you want? Speak."

"The Three Gates will open, reappearing in the Myriad Realms! The Heaven Gate and Human Gate are temporarily inaccessible, but the Earth Gate has developed cracks. In the Myriad Realms, the Human Emperor, Culture King, and Su Yu are all formidable talents... If these people are not eliminated, the Myriad Realms will never be at peace..."

The Lord of Chaos remained indifferent, listening to the other speak for a while before calmly saying, "You are not the first messenger from the Human Gate over the years, and I believe you won't be the last! But every time, it's the same rhetoric. Try something new! What benefits? What interests? What can you offer me?"

The distant figure chuckled, "There are benefits, of course. As long as the Lord of Chaos is willing to forcibly open the Earth Gate now and advance into the Myriad Realms, once the Human Gate opens, we can help the Lord of Chaos resist the Heaven Gate! The Heaven Gate has many powerful beings, numerous Forbidden Land Lords. Although the Lord of Chaos is strong, within the Heaven Gate, you might only be a Forbidden Land Lord..."

The Lord of Chaos remained calm, "So, the Earth Gate is the vanguard, while your Human Gate hides behind to reap the benefits? Wishful thinking. The Heaven Gate may have many strong beings, but so what? The Earth Gate is the weakest, and the Human Gate is the most mysterious. If they want to deal with someone, the Heaven Gate will target the Human Gate first, not the Earth Gate."

With that, the Lord of Chaos spoke in an ancient tone, "Stop with these empty promises. They are meaningless!"

"Then what does the Lord of Chaos want?"

The figure smiled, "You can set the terms. We don't ask for much. Open the Earth Gate first to prevent the Human Emperor and Su Yu from having more time. The longer they delay, the more advantageous it is for them! If the Lord of Chaos knows them well, you should know I'm not lying! Maybe in three years, maybe in five, they will have improved significantly!"

The Lord of Chaos was silent for a moment before suddenly saying, "I want the Ten Thousand Dao Stones!"

The figure was slightly taken aback, surprised, "Lord of Chaos... you must be joking! Besides, you don't follow the Ten Thousand Dao, why would you need the Ten Thousand Dao Stones?"

The Lord of Chaos replied calmly, "Why not? In the past, when the River of Time was opened, the Myriad Realms were established, using the Human Gate as a foundation. On that day, I saw the origin of the Ten Thousand Dao, the foundational place, where some Ten Thousand Dao Stones appeared. They should have fallen into the Human Gate... If you want to cooperate, exchange them for this!"

The figure smiled wryly, "Even if there were, they would have been used long ago! Those are treasures; whoever obtained them would not leave them unused."

The Lord of Chaos replied calmly, "I don't care. If you want us, the Earth Gate, to be your pathfinder, then exchange them for this! Over the years, whether it's you, the Heaven Gate, or the Myriad Realms, people have entered the Earth Gate! Didn't you create that crack yourselves? I couldn't be bothered to manage it... Do as you please! But if you want me to exert effort for you... at least three Ten Thousand Dao Stones!"

The figure was almost suffocated, taking a long time before saying, "When the heavens were opened, the Dao was established, and the Myriad Realms originated from the Human Gate, but even then, not many Ten Thousand Dao Stones appeared..."

"There weren't any back then!"

The Lord of Chaos said in a deep voice, "The Ten Thousand Dao Stones of that time were origin stones! But over the years, as the River of Time flows from the upper reaches to the lower reaches, the power of the Ten Thousand Dao gathers. There should be quite a few Ten Thousand Dao Stones formed from the power of the Ten Thousand Dao. These can be considered Ten Thousand Dao Rule Stones... I want one origin stone to comprehend the Dao rules of that person, and the other two can be Ten Thousand Dao Rule Stones!"

"This... I cannot decide."

"Then get lost!"

The Lord of Chaos said with extreme indifference, "If you can't decide, why are you here? Let someone qualified come to me. If you're not qualified next time... don't bother me again..."

Boom!

A claw reached out, and the distant figure shattered instantly. Not only that, but a chaotic force spread out, reaching an unknown destination. Suddenly, a muffled groan was heard, and the Lord of Chaos's voice remained indifferent, following the chaotic force, "You heard it. This is just a small punishment. Give me what I want, and I'll consider it. Otherwise... there's no need to talk further!"

With that, the shadow of the Lord of Chaos disappeared.

The entire Gate of Hell fell silent once more.

...

At the same time, within the Heaven Gate.

A massive mountain stood between heaven and earth, spanning the void, radiating for millions of miles. Within the mountain, it was like a world of its own. All living beings existed within this mountain, living within this forbidden land.

This mountain, like a star, emitted a faint glow.

The Eternal Life Mountain!

It had been powerful for countless ages, undying and eternal, forbidding entry to the living. But today, a white figure appeared between heaven and earth, standing atop the mountain, a voice filled with mirth spreading out, covering the vast Eternal Life Mountain.

"Law! Hand over my sister, or I will flatten the Eternal Life Mountain! It's been so many years, you can't kill me, but I will kill you eventually. Don't be ungrateful!"

"Audacious!"

"Courting death!"

"Kill!"

Within the Eternal Life Mountain, powerful figures emerged, swiftly charging towards the Culture King. For many years, they had been fighting these two, familiar with them. Seeing him again, the Eternal Life Mountain was not panicked, only furious. This guy was too bold!

He dared to approach the forbidden land directly!

The Culture King was strong, but this was the Eternal Life Mountain!

In the void, the Culture King looked at them and chuckled, "In the past, I was worried about disturbing the heavens, the Heaven Gate opening, and didn't want to bother with you. Did you really think you were something?"

With that, a pair of white shoes appeared between heaven and earth. With a kick, the white shoes instantly appeared before a strong figure, and in the blink of an eye, with a bang, the opponent's head exploded!

The pursuing strong figures were all stunned, then terrified!

How could this be!

At this moment, within the Eternal Life Mountain, an aura rose. The Culture King's eyes flickered, and he laughed, "Law, come out and play with me!"

In an instant, a figure appeared out of thin air, looking at the Culture King, speaking indifferently, "You've become bold."

As if chatting, the tone was calm, taking steps towards the Culture King, "Are you seeking death?"

The Culture King smiled brightly, "A little!"

With that, the Culture King vanished from his spot.

The figure, watching him leave, raised an eyebrow slightly, his eyes shining like the sun and moon, watching him flee, speaking softly, "Are you trying to lure me away? Then I'll accompany you."

He took a step, golden lotuses blooming beneath his feet, instantly crossing the void, a step spanning millions of miles. In the blink of an eye, the Culture King's figure reappeared before him.

Ahead, the Culture King smiled, turning back to glance at him, smiling brightly, "Law, tell me, who instructed you to imprison my sister? I can let you die with some peace of mind!"

The master of the Eternal Life Mountain, known as Law, spoke softly, "Kill me first, then we'll talk!"

Golden lotuses bloomed beneath his feet, Law took a step forward, closing in on the Culture King once more.

The Culture King did not stop, swiftly fleeing through the void. Law pursued for a while, then suddenly halted!

Simultaneously, in the distance, a world resembling a dark abyssal hell appeared.

At this moment, a grand voice echoed, "You two, do you want to die? I didn't come looking for you, yet you dare to enter my domain. Do you both have a death wish?"

A formidable figure, filled with deathly aura, appeared!

The Lord of the Undead!

Behind, Law frowned slightly. What was the Culture King trying to do?

This guy was not easy to provoke.

Entering his territory would only make the situation more chaotic!

But the Culture King laughed, speaking, "Lord of the Undead, help me kill him!"

"......"

In the distance, the Lord of the Undead thought he was crazy.

Who do you think you are?

Do I need to listen to you?

Even within this Heaven Gate, he was a top-tier overlord. Not to mention the Culture King, even Law had no right to be arrogant before him!

The Culture King laughed again, "What are you looking at? I've already contacted the outside world. Su Yu's strength is growing day by day. I'm asking him to break your Death Path. Do you still want to return and continue controlling the Death Path? If you're not afraid of being severed, then don't help me!"

The Lord of the Undead laughed in anger, "You mean that bastard? Does he have that capability? Even if you get out, what can you do?"

The Culture King laughed again, "He has mastered the Path of Life and Death, opened a world, do you know that?"

"......"

The Lord of the Undead fell silent instantly.

The Culture King said softly, "I haven't opened the Path of Life and Death, so I can't do anything to you. But... with the Path of Life and Death opened, your path is not unbreakable. Stop pretending to be invincible. If you were outside, he naturally couldn't defeat you, but you're not outside now, are you? Consider it, kill Law, and we can have a good talk!"

The Lord of the Undead sneered, "Threaten me? Let that guy try! So what if he has opened the Death Path? I've been on this path for countless years; how could he possibly affect me?"

"You... are quite dull!" 

The Culture King chuckled and swiftly vanished. "Forget it, do as you please, Law. Keep chasing me!"

Law raised an eyebrow slightly. What exactly was the Culture King planning? Chasing him was no easy task. Although the Culture King was weaker in strength, he had numerous tricks up his sleeve and was incredibly fast.

Law initially thought the Culture King was relying on the Lord of the Undead, but that wasn't the case. It seemed he was merely wandering around. For a moment, Law hesitated. After some consideration, he quickly disappeared from where he stood, returning to the Mountain of Eternity. As for the Culture King... let him run for now; there was no need to chase him. He would eventually return.

Not far away, the Lord of the Undead glanced at the two of them, then vanished after a moment's pause.

At the same time, the Culture King stopped, a smile playing on his lips. He quickly turned back and flew towards the Mountain of Eternity.

Law, I'll have some fun with you. Over the years, you've caused me no small amount of trouble. Before the Heaven Gate opens, I must resolve this nuisance.
