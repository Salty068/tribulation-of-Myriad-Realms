Chapter 704: Observing the Heavens and Comprehending the Dao

In the distance, the Great Zhou King departed with Marquis Dingjun. Su Yu paid them no mind, and Lantian quietly followed behind. That was not something Su Yu needed to concern himself with.

At this moment, Su Yu was busy with his own matters.

Observing the Heavens!

Yes, those two words carried profound meaning and resonance. The last time Su Yu visited the Culture King's Residence, he saw the words "Observing the Heavens" inscribed on the back door. At that time, he didn't understand. Now, he often found himself observing the heavens, realizing that this sky was indeed different.

In the Death Realm, the sky held a Death Path. In the Myriad Realms, there was the River of Time, along with countless tributaries. However, in the Upper Realm, the River of Time was invisible, shrouded in a haze. This place seemed like a pure land, untouched by any established rules.

"If the River of Time is also a great path... that implies someone opened the heavens in the Myriad Realms, leaving behind the River of Time. Thus, the master of the River of Time is the one who opened the heavens!"

"Later, the master of the Death Path stole power and opened the heavens in the Death Realm, but it was incomplete and weak, hence the existence of the Death Path. The master of this path is also an opener of the heavens!"

"In the Upper Realm, the Human Emperor originally intended to make it his domain. Perhaps he also wanted to open the heavens and become the third opener, but he encountered trouble before succeeding. Otherwise, there should be a special river here as well."

"Among the three openers, the master of the River of Time was the most successful. The master of the Death Path borrowed the power of the River of Time's master, while the Human Emperor didn't succeed or only just started. However, the Human Emperor might also have wanted to steal the power of the River of Time."

"The power of the great path here is evident, with many unowned rules. Could it be that they overflowed from the River of Time, or did the Human Emperor also open a breach like the Death Path, but failed to connect his own path, causing the power of the great path to overflow?"

"......"

Observing the heavens was a form of enlightenment, a way to perceive the essence of the world.

Today, Su Yu increasingly felt that when the Culture King wrote "Observing the Heavens," it wasn't merely about looking at the sky. Perhaps it also implied the idea of a frog at the bottom of a well.

How many true experts exist in this world?

If the River of Time has a master, where is that master?

Is the master of the Death Path truly dead?

Who are the Culture King and his peers fighting against?

The more he saw, the more he knew, the smaller he felt.

The so-called masters of rules are merely the owners of tributaries on the River of Time, insignificant compared to the entire river.

Where is the end of the River of Time?

How long and powerful is it?

Su Yu had seen one end of the Death Path, but not the other. Yet, he believed that in this lifetime, he still had hope of reaching the level of the master of the Death Path.

But what about the master of the River of Time?

Although Lantian had carved out his own bloody path on this great river, how far did that path extend across the River of Time?

A tenth of its length?

A hundredth?

Or a ten-thousandth?

Moreover, could this bloody path spread across the entire River of Time?

Lantian's path was still long and distant, with more potential than other paths. However, becoming a master of rules seemed unlikely for him. In this lifetime, he could only be a Daofuse cultivator!

Unless one day he could occupy the entire River of Time, he would remain a Daofuse cultivator forever, with no end to his path.

Just like the human race's physical path, some have traveled far, comparable to the power of a master of rules, yet they are not masters of rules because this path does not belong to them.

"The human race's physical path might have been pioneered by the Human Ancestor, another extremely powerful great path. Of the paths I've seen, the River of Time is the first, the Death Path the second, and the human race's physical path the third..."

"The Human Ancestor, from the primordial era... no, from the era of opening the heavens."

"Primordial... the Culture King and his peers actually belong to the primordial era, but they ended it and opened the ancient era."

"It's said the Human Ancestor's surname was Zhou, or perhaps just Zhou. Did such a powerful figure as the Human Ancestor die too?"

"Hongmeng said he existed during the era of opening the heavens, over two hundred thousand years ago. Is that true? Has it only been over two hundred thousand years since the heavens were opened?"

"Some Daofuse cultivators can live over a hundred thousand years, let alone masters of rules. If it's really only been over two hundred thousand years, they should still be alive unless they encountered accidents, right?"

"......"

Upon reaching the Upper Realm, Su Yu's observations and insights grew richer.

The Upper Realm had a unique advantage that Su Yu had sensed.

Here, the power of the great path was mixed, or rather, it was turbid!

This place was in a state akin to the initial opening of the heavens.

A place with few established rules.

Here, it was actually quite interesting. Opening the heavens might be simpler.

Opening a path might be easier!

Perhaps even... continuing what the Human Emperor intended to do, opening a path here, a path that reaches the heavens!

"Then why can't one become a master of rules?"

At this point, Su Yu had one unresolved doubt.

Why can't one become a master of rules?

"Is it truly because of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, because of his existence, that the ancient imperial court's fortune still lingers, and the Human Emperor's actions have locked everyone out of becoming masters of rules?"

"How did he achieve that?"

Su Yu pondered, thinking about the Human Emperor.

If he were the Human Emperor, he would imagine himself knowing that a crisis for the human race was imminent because the Culture King, Martial King, and other powerful figures had left, and the myriad races were stirring.

At this moment, besides taking away those masters of rules, what else should I do to prevent the myriad races from overturning the situation?

The Torchbearer is one aspect. Secondly, should I block everyone from becoming masters of rules?

But if there are no masters of rules, and the myriad races have more Daofuse cultivators, how can we overturn the situation?

"Is it about the human race's physical path... is that it?"

Su Yu thought, because if no one can become a master of rules, then the human race's physical path becomes the number one path in the world. No, there's also the Death Path, but with the Four Heavenly Kings in the Death Path, if we don't consider the Death Path, it has sealed a group of powerful figures, making it difficult for stronger figures than those on the physical path to emerge.

"If that's the case... the Human Emperor's calculations are unprecedented. He calculated that the human race would produce a strong figure like the Hundred Battle King, suppressing the heavens! The only thing he didn't account for was that this guy, who was supposed to suppress the heavens, turned out to be an idiot!"

From the perspective of the Human Emperor, Su Yu thought, everything that should have been done was done.

The human race was destined to win!

Damn it!

How did a sure-win situation almost turn into a sure-loss one?

Unbelievable!

"So, as long as no master of rules emerges, the human race can't lose!"

"If the human race unifies the heavens again, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis might become the next master of rules, stepping into the realm of masters of rules alongside the Hundred Battle King, breaking the Human Emperor's seal and allowing the human race to produce masters of rules again. The myriad races might also produce them, but the human race would be one step ahead, having two masters of rules first."

"Plus, if the Martial Emperor can be subdued, it means the human race would have three masters of rules first, and then they could complete the unification of the heavens!"

"......Human Emperor......"

The more Su Yu thought, the more he felt that the Human Emperor was the strongest figure in the heavens, the ultimate strategist.

Impressive!

In the outside world, the Human Emperor was rarely mentioned, but for Su Yu, the more he learned, the more he realized that the Human Emperor was truly formidable.

The Culture King was very carefree, leaving when he wanted, staying when he wished.

The Martial King was reckless, loyal, and when the Culture King left, he felt the Culture King was in trouble and immediately chased after him.

The Radiant King might have been deeply in love; there weren't many legends or introductions about him. It's unknown if the Radiant King was with the Human Emperor, but it's possible.

The Control King... betrayed!

So where is the Control King now?

With the Demon Emperor?

The Demon Emperor and the Control King share a bloodline, clearly indicating they were involved.

One thought after another arose, and in the end, the ancient Human Emperor, for the first time, overshadowed the Culture King in Su Yu's mind. This figure was more formidable than the Culture King, according to Su Yu's own deductions.

Not to mention, at least he had planned and prepared more.

"So, does this mean that the absence of masters of rules in the Myriad Realms is actually the doing of the Human Emperor?"

"And the core is actually with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis!"

"Destroy the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, and perhaps... a master of rules could be born, breaking all of the Human Emperor's calculations, right?"

"If I kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis... does that mean the myriad races might produce a master of rules? The Hundred Battle King might also succeed... or not, because that would mean his fortune dissipates... no, that's not right. His strength is still there, so he still has hope of becoming a master of rules, just without the strong fortune."

"Is the Heavenly Overseer Marquis that important?"

Su Yu laughed.

No way!

Did the Human Emperor and the Culture King place this core with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis?

"Indeed, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis is actually the hardest to kill because he represents fortune..."

One clue after another, deduced and inferred, Su Yu had now pieced together a general outline of the ancient Human Emperor's departure!

This wasn't a useless speculation; it was extremely important!

Important enough that the timing of confronting the Heavenly Overseer Marquis needed careful consideration.

The consequences needed to be thoroughly weighed!

After killing the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, the ancient era might end, and the Human Emperor's seal could be lifted, restarting everything. That would mean the myriad races might produce masters of rules!

Su Yu suddenly laughed.

When did he start thinking so far ahead? Wasn't he always someone who only thought about the next second?

The journey to the Upper Realm had just begun, yet Su Yu felt he had gained some insights.

His own path seemed to be becoming clearer.

Opening a path!

Opening a path that belongs to himself!

Su Yu, your path can only belong to you.

Because ahead of you, there might be many failed examples: the Human Ancestor, the master of the Death Path, the Human Emperor. These people might have all failed.

"Because they never truly severed their connection with the River of Time!"

"This isn't right; it should be severed, completely parallel, not intersecting!"

Su Yu turned his head to gaze at the horizon, as if he could see a breach, a rift that pierced through the River of Time. Was the Human Emperor attempting to carve out his own path in the Upper Realm? Had the Culture King abandoned the pen dao for the same reason? And what of the Culture King's current situation?

...

The Marquis of Steadfast Army thought Su Yu was looking at him, filled with some trepidation, as he had heard a few things about Su Yu from the Great Zhou King. At this moment, seeing Su Yu glance in his direction, he assumed Su Yu intended to kill him. His expression turned heavy and grim as he spoke in a low voice, "Great Zhou King... whether it's the Hundred Battle King or this new Human Lord, they are all part of the human race. Does it benefit the human race, no matter who wins or loses? Wouldn't it be better to unite and defeat the myriad races together, rather than... this?"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Then let me ask you, who should lead? Ultimately, there must be a hierarchy! Even in ancient times, the Culture King was outstanding, but don't forget, there was only one emperor in the ancient era!"

The Marquis of Steadfast Army hesitated to speak.

The Great Zhou King sighed again, "What do you think?"

After a long pause, the Marquis of Steadfast Army struggled to respond, "According to what you say, this new Human Lord... is formidable! But currently, his strength... his strength is still far from the top-tier experts!"

Taking a deep breath, the Marquis continued, "I understand, from what you've said, that everything the human race has now is due to his efforts. But the Hundred Battle King's strength is what we need. Why not have two leaders?"

The Great Zhou King laughed. Compared to before, it seemed these people had changed somewhat. If it were in the past, or right after their defeat, no one would have suggested this. But now, the Marquis of Steadfast Army was proposing dual leadership. This was actually a good start, but the Great Zhou King knew this wasn't the outcome Su Yu wanted to hear.

"So, you're saying that if Emperor Yu surpasses the Hundred Battle King, then you would find Emperor Yu more suitable?"

The Marquis of Steadfast Army remained silent for a moment before nodding slightly, "I haven't interacted with him much, but from what you've said, I do believe that if he had the strength of the Hundred Battle King, he could certainly do better."

The Great Zhou King smiled, "I believe he will soon surpass the Hundred Battle King!"

The Marquis hesitated, "I'm just worried that progressing too quickly in the early stages might lead to bottlenecks later on. It's not impossible! You say he doesn't follow the conventional path of the physical dao, with no path to follow... Of course, he inherited the pen dao from the Culture King, which does have a path. But... is the pen dao truly easier to master than the physical dao? If not, he might not become the master of rules and could still be weaker than the Hundred Battle King."

The Marquis's thoughts were clear. If Su Yu were stronger than the Hundred Battle King, there would be no question—Su Yu would be more suitable. Even if he wasn't as strong, if their strengths were comparable, Su Yu would still be more suitable as the Human Lord. The key issue was that there was still a significant gap in strength between the two.

He continued, "I'm also worried that once the Hundred Battle King is unsealed, afterward... this one doesn't seem like someone who would submit. And to be honest, the Hundred Battle King is quite domineering. By then, one side will have to yield, or else there will be internal strife."

The Marquis of Steadfast Army smiled bitterly, "Before, we just wanted to survive, and the Hundred Battle King was the only choice! Now, with another option, the hope of survival is greater, yet it makes me hesitant. Tell me, isn't it true that people... shouldn't be too satisfied?"

He spoke bitterly, "I would prefer to see a scene from the ancient era, where the Human Emperor leads and the Four Kings assist. But the Human Emperor could subdue the Four Kings. I'm worried..."

Worried that Su Yu couldn't subdue the Hundred Battle King.

As they were discussing this, Su Yu, who had been watching them, suddenly had a slight fluctuation in his aura. The Great Zhou King and the Marquis of Steadfast Army immediately looked at him, both somewhat surprised.

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly manifested a character.

That character fluctuated continuously.

In the next moment, another character appeared.

"Cosmos."

Yes, it was these two characters.

The universe is the space above and below, and time is the past and present.

Previously, Su Yu had outlined these two characters, but they had remained dormant for a long time. Today, with Su Yu's thoughts and being in the Upper Realm, a place where the rules were murky, he suddenly had an epiphany.

The heavens of the myriad realms did not belong to him but to the River of Time! The heavens of the Death Realm did not belong to him but to the path of death. But the heavens of the Upper Realm had no master yet!

"So, if I were to carve a path, I should choose to do it here!"

Su Yu understood!

The Upper Realm was actually the best place for him to carve his path.

However, the premise was that he needed to prepare enough power, the power of laws, to open and fill the great path.

"So, I must steal more power and not remain entangled with the River of Time!"

"But in doing so, I would lose an origin point. The paths of the Death Realm and others are all opened from the River of Time... origin point... Mark of Civilization!"

At that moment, suddenly, the words "Cosmos" merged into the book.

"Cosmic Civilization!"

Su Yu was stunned for a moment. This was an automatic integration because, with his enlightenment, his Mark of Civilization, the weapon he forged to prove his dao, seemed to have also understood Su Yu's thoughts.

Cosmic Civilization!

This world, this past and present, the civilization of this world, should all be integrated into one!

"There should be heaven, earth, air, life, death, yin and yang, the five elements, and all paths..."

One by one, the characters quickly merged into the Mark of Civilization.

With his insights, they all integrated into the Mark of Civilization.

In the end, Su Yu was momentarily dazed.

In his mind, the original hundreds of characters suddenly disappeared, leaving only one character.

"↑"

Yes, only the pen dao remained!

The other characters either shattered or directly merged into the Mark of Civilization.

The aura of the Mark of Civilization grew stronger once again.

...

"What... what is he doing?"

The Marquis of Steadfast Army was somewhat shaken. He could see that it seemed like... he was comprehending the dao?

While we are chatting here, you are over there comprehending the dao?

The Great Zhou King also had a peculiar look in his eyes. What new insights had Su Yu gained upon coming to the Upper Realm?

Recently, he had noticed that Su Yu's progress was incredibly fast, constantly gaining new insights. What had this person just been thinking about?

The Great Zhou King had a vague feeling that the book in Su Yu's hand might end up being terrifyingly powerful.

And at this moment, Su Yu put away his book.

In his sea of will, there was now only one book and one character. These were his two paths.

He had merged all the myriad paths.

In the end, only two paths remained.

When characters like "Calamity" and "Yin" were all integrated into the Cosmic Mark of Civilization, Su Yu made a decision. He would no longer open other paths. Besides mastering the pen dao, the rest of his life might be dedicated to this book.

To carve out a path of his own!

"Cosmic Mark of Civilization... forget it, let's just call it the Mark of Civilization."

Su Yu chuckled. Cosmic Mark of Civilization didn't sound good; Mark of Civilization would suffice.

Civilization encompasses everything.

He was still smiling when, in the distance, a little girl named Blue Sky suddenly shouted, "Brother Emperor Yu, this old man, the Marquis of Steadfast Army, is so bad. He said he wants to establish two leaders, making you and the Hundred Battle King both the bosses!"

In the next moment, everyone within the formation looked at Su Yu and then at the Marquis of Steadfast Army.

The Marquis's face changed slightly. He glanced at the little girl beside him, whom he had almost ignored earlier.

His subordinates were all extremely tense at this moment.

They actually had a rough idea of what was happening, and now they were all suddenly on edge.

Would they die?

Grandstar and June, among others, were already tense, with a hint of readiness to act. At Su Yu's command, they would strike and kill these people.

The Marquis of Steadfast Army's expression grew increasingly grim!

Because Su Yu was merely looking at him without speaking, and that gaze... he didn't know how to describe it. At this moment, having lived for over a hundred thousand years and having met the Human Emperor, he actually felt a bit afraid of Su Yu's thoughts.

Yet Su Yu was quite calm, not paying much attention to these matters. After a moment, he slowly said, "Before the Hundred Battle King is unsealed, serve me!"

"When the Hundred Battle King is unsealed, you can leave, but for now, you must serve me!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, "Because I saved you. If I hadn't killed that Daofuse expert from the Demon Race, you would have been surrounded, and you would have died soon. All your subordinates would have perished! I saved your life. My demand is not much—serve until the Upper Realm opens. Do you have any objections?"

"...No!"

The Marquis of Steadfast Army's face was heavy, his head lowered. After thinking for a moment, he still said in a deep voice, "This old minister is not one to rely on age to act superior. I just... just don't want to see internal strife among the human race, creating divisions..."

Su Yu replied calmly, "These matters are not for you to manage! You are an elder of the human race, and I can respect you, but do not dictate to me! The new era has its own rules. If you are not accustomed, you can leave after the Upper Realm opens!"

"This old minister... understands!"

The Marquis of Steadfast Army sighed deeply in his heart. Su Yu did not continue, merely looking at his subordinates. Soon, he pointed to an elderly man with white hair, "You, come out. You can operate outside and prepare to advance to Daofuse! The rest, enter the weapon space."

"I also want to fight..."

Suddenly, a young woman in the crowd shouted, and Su Yu's gaze turned cold, icy beyond measure. The Sunmoon Realm woman instantly turned pale!

The Marquis of Steadfast Army was startled and hurriedly said, "Emperor... Emperor Yu, this is my daughter. She is still young, born in the Valley of the Bright Moon Flowers, and has never seen the outside world. She doesn't know the immensity of heaven and earth..."

Su Yu's expression softened slightly. A pitiful life.

Born in the Valley of the Bright Moon Flowers, never having seen the world outside—if this isn't pitiful, what is?

Previously, he thought this girl was too bold, daring to interrupt when he gave orders. But now, thinking about it, he no longer held it against her. Her world was only as big as the Valley of the Bright Moon Flowers.

Su Yu recalled what Bai Feng had once told him: the size of your world and the height of your vision depend on what you have seen and who you compare yourself to.

If you spend your entire life in Nanyuan, the highest cultivation realm you'll ever witness is the Skysoar Realm! Yes, in Nanyuan, that's all you can see!

Bai Feng's words had a profound impact on Su Yu. Because of them, he always yearned to experience higher realms, to face stronger opponents, and to engage in more intense battles. His vision was constantly expanding and evolving.

It wasn't until he opened the Heaven Gate that Su Yu truly understood just how vast the heavens were! Without opening the Heaven Gate, perhaps his aspirations would still be confined to the Myriad Realms. Without it, his life's pursuit might have been limited to reaching the realms of figures like Tiangu, sweeping across the world, invincible in his era.

These thoughts flashed through his mind, and Su Yu calmly said, "Join Hu Xiansheng and the others. Experience the world outside, see how high the heavens are and how deep the earth is! The so-called Upper Realm is nothing more than a cage for birds! Whether it's the Upper Realm, the Lower Realm, or the Death Realm, the highest heavens are in the Lower Realm!"

Most of the people didn't understand his words. Even the Marquis of Dingjun was puzzled. However, at that moment, the Marquis of Dingjun's expression changed slightly, and he suddenly said, "These words... I seem to have heard them before."

Su Yu looked at him, and the Marquis of Dingjun swallowed, "I remember... many years ago, during a banquet hosted by the Human Emperor at the ninth level of the Luminous Domain Mansion, he gazed at the sky and said: 'In this world, the heavens of the Myriad Realms are the highest, followed by the heavens of the Death Realm. For the Human Race to truly rise, we must open our own heavens and become our own masters...' After that grand banquet, the Human Race devoted all its efforts to developing the Upper Realm, but before it was completed, the ancient era perished!"

Su Yu smiled and nodded, "Because the Human Emperor saw what you couldn't see and understood what you couldn't comprehend. It's normal. For the Human Race to truly rise, indeed, we need to open our own heavens and become our own masters. These words are the ultimate truth of the Great Dao!"

He continued with a smile, "There are probably very few who can truly understand this. I hope that in the future, someone by my side will."

The Great Zhou King remained silent, while Lantian, munching on a lollipop, thought for a moment and giggled, "A lofty tune with few listeners, indeed, not many can understand. Rest assured, Emperor Yu, I somewhat understand. The heavens of the Myriad Realms may be high, but no matter how high, I'll pierce them with a needle and surpass them!"

"......"

Su Yu laughed, suddenly finding the situation amusing. After a while, he laughed heartily, "Daoist Lantian, you truly are one of my kind! If you were a bit more serious, I think I'd be more willing to have a good chat with you!"

Daoist!

Su Yu rarely used this term to address someone, but today, he called Lantian a Daoist.

Lantian giggled, "Emperor Yu, you're so bad. I'm very serious..."

"......"

Oh, come on!

Su Yu chuckled, glancing at the Great Zhou King, who seemed deep in thought. He smiled and said, "Great Zhou King, you should reflect more. Otherwise, in a few days, Daoist Lantian will surely surpass you by a long shot! Even Principal Wan will certainly surpass you!"

"That would be a fortunate event!"

The Great Zhou King also smiled, "I am naturally dull-witted and have only reached this point due to some fortuitous encounters. Compared to you, Emperor Yu, I am naturally far behind."

Su Yu smiled and said no more. Today, he didn't speak much about the Marquis of Dingjun, only allowing him to act alongside him. If it weren't inconvenient to send him to the Lower Realm now, he would have done so. But there wasn't a suitable opportunity, so he kept him by his side.

As his vision expanded, figures like the Marquis of Dingjun and the Hundred Battle King seemed insignificant. To put it bluntly, Su Yu's aspirations lay beyond them. He repeatedly suppressed the Great Zhou King and others, simply hoping that during this period, no one would oppose him.

He felt he was worthy of the position of Human Lord! Otherwise, he wouldn't care who took the position.

Titles and power are mere jokes. If the heavens are mine, what are the Human Emperor and Human Lord but jokes?

"Let's leave it at that!"

Su Yu quickly said, "Let's find a new place for our base. Soul Burying Mountain isn't suitable. There are too many people here, and if something happens, it will be easily discovered that this is the passage to the Lower Realm."

This place couldn't be stayed at for long.

He looked at the Marquis of Dingjun and asked, "Marquis of Dingjun, you're an old-timer. Where in the Upper Realm do you think would be suitable for our base? The more dangerous, the better. Ideally, a place where even a Heavenly King would be at risk!"

He added with a smile, "Forget about places like the Bright Moon Flower Valley, which are only threatening to ordinary Daofuse cultivators. They don't pose much of a threat to us."

The Marquis of Dingjun smiled wryly. What a statement! That was a place he had painstakingly found for safety, now being dismissed as worthless.

Despite this, he quickly said, "If we're talking about danger... there is a place that is indeed dangerous!"

"Speak!"

"Located in the west of the Upper Realm, it's the Chaos Mountain!"

As the Marquis of Dingjun spoke, he felt a bit embarrassed himself, "But forget it, that place is too dangerous."

Not only him, but even the Great Zhou King also showed a slight change in expression.

Chaos Mountain!

He glanced at the Marquis of Dingjun and couldn't help but speak in a low voice, "Nonsense! At your age, do you want to bury us there?"

"Chaos Mountain?"

Su Yu wasn't concerned and thought for a moment. He vaguely remembered something from the memories of the Marquis of Falling Star. Su Yu smiled, "The Chaos Mountain where even the rulers of laws dare not enter?"

The Marquis of Dingjun awkwardly said, "Yes, that's the one. I just mentioned it because it's said that there are many treasures there, but also many dangers. Of course, the myriad races don't dare to enter either, which is why I brought it up..."

The Great Zhou King quickly said, "Absolutely not! Emperor Yu, I actually know a bit about Chaos Mountain. It's a place where, in ancient times, the Human Race cleared the Upper Realm and drove some powerful beings to gather. Some of these powerful beings are like the Desolate Heavenly Beasts, originating from the time of the Opening of the Heavens! Later, whether they were killed or not, there hasn't been much news..."

He paused for a moment and continued, "This place is extremely dangerous. In ancient times, the Culture King punished the Control King there! When the Control King made a mistake, the Culture King punished him by sending him to Chaos Mountain to guard the Gate of Hell for ten thousand years!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. He had no memory of this, clearly indicating that the Marquis of Falling Star didn't know about it.

The Marquis of Dingjun was also surprised, "When did this happen?"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "At the end of the ancient era! The Control King didn't actually guard it for ten thousand years. He was soon recalled by the Human Emperor, who pardoned his crimes... By then, the Culture King had already left, so there wasn't much commotion, and few people knew about it. The Control King left less than a thousand years later, and everyone thought he was in seclusion, but he wasn't!"

"After the Control King returned, I saw him from a distance once..."

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath, "Terrifying, resentful, hateful! The Control King's betrayal of the Human Race is probably related to this!"

"The Control King betrayed the Human Race?"

The Marquis of Dingjun was once again taken aback, "What betrayal?"

The Great Zhou King impatiently said, "You know nothing, living from ancient times to now in vain! It's understandable, your status was too low, your strength too weak. An ancient marquis, yet still so weak today, of course, you wouldn't know!"

The Marquis of Dingjun almost choked.

I am an ancient marquis!

Among the crowd, his daughter also had a peculiar look in her eyes. Her father had always spoken of the glory of ancient times, of his high status, and she believed that her father, this ancient marquis, held a high position.

After all, figures like the Human Emperor, the Four Extremes Human Kings, and the emperors of the myriad races had all interacted with her father, and even the emperors of the myriad races treated him with respect.

But today... why did it suddenly seem like her father was boasting?

From the sound of it, her father's status in ancient times didn't seem that high.

Not only did he know nothing, but his strength... didn't seem that strong either. Everyone present was stronger than him.

The majestic image of her father was slightly crumbling!

Su Yu didn't care about these matters. The Great Zhou King, with his knowledge of the Human Emperor's writings, knew quite a bit, but he rarely spoke, perhaps thinking it unnecessary or irrelevant.

At critical moments, he could still dig up some information.

Su Yu smiled, "The Gate of Hell?"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "I don't know the specifics, only that within Chaos Mountain, there is a gate called the Gate of Hell! Where it is, I don't know, and what it looks like, I'm not sure."

"But it has something to do with the Human Emperor and the Culture King... When they were developing the Upper Realm, they might have made some agreements with ancient beings. The Gate of Hell might be a portal, or perhaps... a boundary!"

"A boundary?"

Su Yu frowned slightly, and the Great Zhou King said solemnly, "It might be a dividing line drawn by those ancient beings and the Human Race! On this side of the Gate of Hell is the territory of the Human Race, and on the other side is the territory of the ancient beings! Whether this is the case, I don't know, but the Control King guarded it for a thousand years, possibly getting injured or experiencing battles... I don't recommend going there!"

He said heavily, "There must be many treasures there, no doubt, but the dangers will be equally terrifying! Most likely, there are still many ancient beasts from the primordial era, or even from the time of the Opening of the Heavens, lurking, sleeping, or remaining in a muddled state, never having awakened."

Su Yu laughed, "The Upper Realm still has so many interesting places! So no one can enter?"

The Marquis of Dingjun thought for a moment and said, "Not exactly, it should still be possible to enter, but only on the periphery! Even the periphery, the myriad races dare not enter rashly. Over 3,000 years ago, a strong figure from our Human Race actually entered. It was the Marquis of Anbei! The Marquis of Anbei went in with people to take refuge, avoiding pursuit by the myriad races, and lived in Chaos Mountain for over a hundred years until he came out several times to attack the myriad races, leading to another siege..."

He sighed, "I mentioned Chaos Mountain because of this second siege. The Marquis of Anbei fought a great battle with the myriad races in Chaos Mountain. In that battle, the Marquis of Anbei fell, but the myriad races lost seven Daofuse Realm experts!"

Chapter 721: The Forbidden Land

The Marquis of Dingjun sighed, "In truth, the Marquis of Anbei wasn't strong enough to kill seven Daofuse cultivators. During the battle, three or four ancient behemoths emerged from the depths of Chaos Mountain, likely disturbed by the commotion. They joined the fray, causing the heavens to tremble and the earth to shatter. In the end, both the Marquis of Anbei and the seven Daofuse cultivators from the myriad races perished, along with two of the ancient behemoths. Since then, that place has become a forbidden zone for the myriad races."

Su Yu was surprised. "I didn't know about this," he remarked with a smile. "If it's possible to enter, why haven't you gone in? The myriad races probably don't dare to venture there, right?"

"They don't dare," the Marquis of Dingjun nodded, then added awkwardly, "However, over a thousand years ago, the Marquis of Leixiao from the Human Race also thought of seeking refuge there to escape the pursuit of the myriad races. But... he hadn't been inside for even half a day before news of his demise spread. The myriad races hadn't even chased him in."

"......"

The Great Zhou King was exasperated. "Then why are you encouraging us to go in? Are you working for the Control King?"

"No, don't misunderstand..." the Marquis of Dingjun explained, "I only suggested it because Emperor Yu mentioned it! The Marquis of Leixiao's strength was similar to mine, but you all are much stronger. I thought, if there's a safe place, it might be there, since the myriad races certainly won't dare to explore it!"

"If we only stay active on the outskirts..."

He glanced at the little girl who was a manifestation of Blue Sky and said nothing. He felt that with her around, moving on the outskirts wouldn't be too dangerous, and they could avoid the myriad races' attention and pursuit. Even if the myriad races knew they were in Chaos Mountain, they wouldn't dare to venture in!

Su Yu's eyes flickered for a moment before he smiled, "Alright, let's go take a look! Don't worry, I have no interest in courting death. We'll find a place on the outskirts to set up camp! Chaos Mountain... the Upper Realm doesn't have much else, but its primitive state is well-preserved. In the myriad realms, you won't find such untouched dangerous lands. The so-called dangerous lands are mostly man-made."

Simply put, the Upper Realm was too wild.

This place, in ancient times, was just a fringe area. Only now, due to the strict rules of the lower realms, has it become known as the Upper Realm.

Su Yu liked the primitive things.

They would certainly help in comprehending the Great Dao.

How could he recreate the world and the Great Dao without experiencing these wildernesses left after the opening of the heavens?

As for danger... the Upper Realm was full of it.

"Emperor Yu..."

The Great Zhou King wanted to persuade him further, but Su Yu smiled, "Enough, I know what you're thinking. I don't want to die either, but this place is indeed suitable for us! We'll take a look, and if it's too dangerous, we'll move elsewhere! If we can manage, we'll stay! Once we have a base, we can focus on our main tasks!"

Main tasks?

The Great Zhou King actually wanted to ask, do you even know what the main tasks are?

There's nothing of the sort!

This time, we're just here to assess the situation and act accordingly.

Take advantage if there's an opportunity, leave if there isn't.

"Let's go, Blue Sky, clean up everything left here, leave a clone behind."

"Everyone else, enter the weapon space first. Blue Sky, leave it to your clone, don't lose it, it'll be hard to find otherwise."

"Great Zhou King, shield our aura, block external detection..."

Su Yu issued one command after another. Soon, the group cleared everything from Soul Burying Mountain and quickly headed towards Chaos Mountain.

On the way, the Marquis of Dingjun actually wanted to say several times, "Release me..."

Alright, maybe they forgot, or it was intentional.

Anyway, no one mentioned it!

The Marquis of Dingjun was helpless. These people from the lower realms were all very distant from him. The only one he could chat with a bit, the Great Zhou King, was now ignoring him because he suggested coming to Chaos Mountain.

This former lord of a region was now just a subordinate, with no say in anything.

"Well..."

The Marquis of Dingjun mused, too tired, having fled for six thousand years, living in constant fear, unable to sleep peacefully, almost unable to hold on.

Now, being a subordinate here... didn't seem too bad.

At least he didn't have to worry so much anymore!

No longer needed to consider where to hide next if the myriad races attacked.

With a hint of self-mockery, he saw his daughter, who was allowed to walk around, secretly watching Su Yu, and he felt a headache coming on. What are you looking at!

Don't look!

People like him, we can't afford to provoke.

Didn't you see these Daofuse experts, all subdued and obedient?

Even though he wasn't very familiar with Su Yu, the Marquis of Dingjun understood one thing: someone who could suppress Tiangu and others in the lower realms was not someone he could provoke.

Tiangu, Jiwu, Demon Halberd—weren't they all geniuses? Yet now, each was sealed, waiting for rescue. If this news spread, the Upper Realm would be shaken.

The Hou Race, Iron Devourer Race, Space Ancient Beast Race, and Fate Race were all working for him, and even those guarding were, which gave the Marquis of Dingjun more thoughts.

The Hundred Battle King, apart from being stronger, really didn't have as many means as this one.

The Marquis of Dingjun even worried that if this one grew stronger, would the Hundred Battle King be played to death by him?

"Forget it, I'm just a vanguard, I won't worry about these things..."

He stopped thinking about it, leaving these matters to other human marquises to worry about.
