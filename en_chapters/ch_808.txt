Chapter 808: Martial Emperor Breaks the Seal

Su Yu quickly calmed his anger.

In times of great events, one must remain composed. Things might not be as bad as they seem. Even if the Hundred Battle King truly intends to bring the Human Ancestor, he might not have the opportunity. And even if he does, it might not go as he wishes.

Stay calm!

Su Yu reminded himself not to panic over such trivial matters. Yes, they were all trivial.

He soon regained his composure, looked at the Martial Emperor, and smiled, "Pardon my outburst, Martial Emperor. Let's continue!"

The Martial Emperor remained silent, unsure how to respond at this moment.

Seeing his silence, Su Yu frowned and asked, "Martial Emperor, do you think I can't release you? That I can't break your seal? Do you not trust me?"

Damn it!

The Martial Emperor was speechless and quickly replied, "Alright, break the seal. I trust you!"

Stop with the nonsense.

He felt that Su Yu was looking for trouble, so it was best to comply and get himself unsealed first.

Su Yu finally smiled in satisfaction.

Soon, 97 tokens floated in the air. At that moment, the entire Sea of Stars began to tremble violently. In the void, strands of the power of laws appeared, remnants left by some top experts from the past.

These powers of laws filled the entire sky.

Boom!

A thunderclap echoed, mirroring Su Yu's mood, as the clear sky turned cloudy.

On the Allheaven Battlefield, thunderclouds suddenly gathered.

In the distance, experts from the Nine Realms were taken aback.

What happened?

Is the sky changing again?

...

Meanwhile, as these powers of laws filled the sky.

In the Human Realm.

One by one, powerful figures appeared in the sky above the Human Realm.

The Hundred Battle King gazed into the distance, frowning slightly.

Beside him, Changqing looked at the sky, at the power of thunder, and frowned slightly, "Your Majesty, this... seems like a sign that the battlefield is about to be completely unsealed."

The Hundred Battle King nodded slightly.

Wu Ji, puzzled, asked, "Is it time already? According to previous estimates, wasn't there still a year or two left?"

The Hundred Battle King remained silent, his eyes revealing a portal as he gazed into the distance.

In his eyes, a figure seemed to appear.

It was Su Yu!

It wasn't that the time had come, but rather that Su Yu was actively unsealing the entire battlefield.

The Hundred Battle King remained silent.

Su Yu!

What is he planning?

He seems to be in the Sea of Stars area, near the Luminous Domain Mansion. Could it be... to unseal the Martial Emperor?

Should he stop it or not?

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King fell into deep thought. Stopping it might lead to a conflict with Su Yu now, and if he obstructed Su Yu, once the Martial Emperor truly broke free, it might lead to a fight to the death.

Has Su Yu reached some sort of agreement with the Martial Emperor to unseal him?

Otherwise, why would Su Yu actively help the Martial Emperor break the seal?

Various thoughts surfaced in his mind.

...

At the same time.

In the Upper Realm.

Winds surged, and clouds gathered.

In the Dao Source Land, the rules were in turmoil.

Above the entire Dao Source Land, a rift seemed to appear, reflecting the void, with the power of laws surging through the heavens and earth.

On the Mountain of Humanity.

One by one, powerful beings quickly floated into the air. The Divine Empress softly said, "Su Yu... has truly gone to unseal the passage to the lower realm."

Earlier, when Su Yu took the councilor's token, everyone knew his intentions.

They didn't expect Su Yu to act so quickly; he was already taking action.

...

Deep within Chaos Mountain.

Several figures, including Yu Qing, also gazed into the distance. Behind them, from the Gate of Hell, half of the Poba Beast's body had emerged, and it asked with some confusion, "What's happening?"

Yue Zhan said solemnly, "The lower realm is about to open!"

This scene wasn't happening for the first time.

Every time the Allheaven Battlefield was unsealed, there was a significant commotion. The Dao Source Land would experience a wave of rule fluctuations, notifying the Upper Realm that the passage to the lower realm's Fate Clan was opening.

It's happening soon!

This wasn't the critical moment yet; it was just a precursor.

Upon hearing this, the Poba Beast laughed heartily, "Good news!"

As soon as it emerged, the passage to the Myriad Realms opened. Isn't that good news?

Although it seemed possible to travel through chaos, the unknown nature of chaos made it risky. Of course, being from the Chaos Ancient Clan, it didn't matter much, but having not ventured out for many years, the Myriad Realms were different from the past. It was better to avoid unfamiliar paths.

Yu Qing also said calmly, "It's good that it's opening. We can also see how strong the Hundred Battle King's side truly is. This should be Su Yu's doing, right? He's opening the lower realm, probably to fully expose the Hundred Battle King!"

Yue Zhan nodded slightly.

Perhaps!

Thinking of something, Yue Zhan hesitated slightly and said, "At this moment, unsealing the lower realm, could it release some individuals?"

"Who?"

"There are some powerful undead sealed in the Death Realm. I wonder if this unsealing will release them."

Yu Qing had heard of this, but it was a long time ago.

Upon hearing this, he thought for a moment and said, "Even if they are unsealed, it won't affect us much. It will affect the lower realm and the Death Realm."

Besides, what if it does affect us?

Should we stop it now?

Yu Qing pondered these things and glanced at the half-emerged Poba Beast, saying, "Poba, once you're out, we still need to capture some powerful beings for sacrifice!"

They still needed to bring in some powerful beings!

Currently, they were only considered stowaways. To quickly emerge, it was best to sacrifice some powerful beings. Otherwise, it would be too difficult to come out.

Yu Qing's emergence was the result of years of planning. Yue Zhan and the others relied on bloodline summoning for years, and even so, several Heavenly Venerables died, and a large amount of the power of laws was seized, allowing Yu Qing to emerge.

As for Poba, it relied on two instances of willpower being devoured, which allowed it to locate this side, and only then could it use the sacrifice of several Heavenly Venerables to emerge.

But for others to come out next, it would be much more difficult.

Although the rift had expanded somewhat, it was still very difficult for powerful beings to appear.

Upon hearing this, Poba laughed coldly, "Of course, it's not difficult. Once I get out, I'll kill that Su Yu, and naturally, I can bring some people here!"

Kill Su Yu!

Yu Qing remained silent for a moment and said nothing. It might be better to eliminate the myriad races first, as they might be easier to deal with than Su Yu. Of course, it was still early to say this, as Poba hadn't fully emerged yet.

...

At the same time.

In the lower realm.

Thunderclouds gathered, and winds surged, with tokens floating in the air.

Su Yu looked up at the sky and suddenly waved his hand. A token appeared, and a shadowy power emanated from Su Yu, instantly activating the token. On the token, a powerful shadow appeared.

As this shadow appeared, a web of lines flickered in the void.

Holding the token, the enormous shadow on the token suddenly opened its mouth, biting towards the web of lines, attempting to devour the power of laws left behind from the past.

The shadow was immense, capable of swallowing the heavens and devouring the sun!

As the thread was devoured, nearby, threads of lines converged on the shadow, seemingly trying to stop it.

At this moment, Su Yu waved his hand again, and tokens appeared, attaching themselves to those threads, temporarily locking them. However, two threads still surged towards Su Yu.

Ninety-nine strands of the power of laws sealed the Allheaven Battlefield back then.

But Su Yu only had 97 tokens.

Two were still missing!

And at this moment, the power of laws corresponding to these two missing tokens erupted!

The rules left by the top experts of the past were all powerful. They were the creators of the rules, and each strand of the power of laws could annihilate some Heavenly Kings!

With 99 gathered, they could even destroy the ruler of laws.

But now, 97 were locked.

What waves could the remaining two stir up?

These two strands of the power of laws, at this moment, transformed into the form of the ruler of laws in the void. A massive shadow appeared, humanoid in shape. Seeing this, Su Yu laughed.

The Ancient Giant Race!

This must be the rule of the Ancient Giant King!

"Although the Ancient Giant King is the ruler of laws, he might not have walked the path of the physical body, or perhaps he also mastered the physical body path of the Ancient Giant Race?"

Su Yu wasn't too sure about this.

At this moment, the massive Ancient Giant King quickly charged at Su Yu. The rules were ruthless. If the time hadn't come, the rules wouldn't dissipate on their own. But being triggered by someone, they naturally aimed to annihilate Su Yu, the rule-breaker!

"Just a dead thing!"

A single rule might have hope of killing a Heavenly King, but in front of me, it dares to show off!

If the real one came, I might be wary, but this is just a lingering power of laws from years ago.

Su Yu punched through the air!

This punch shook the heavens and earth. With a loud boom, the massive Ancient Giant King was shattered by his punch. At this moment, in the distant realm, a figure suddenly appeared, and the realm trembled.

It was the current Ancient Giant King!

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King's expression changed. He sensed that the power of laws left by his ancestor seemed to have been shattered by someone.

He also saw Su Yu!

"Su Yu, how dare you break my ancestor's rules..."

"Annoying!"

Before he could finish, Su Yu coldly punched through the air, and boom!

The punch traversed the void, appearing above the Giant Realm, instantly manifesting before the Ancient Giant King. He had no way to avoid it, roaring as he punched back!

Boom!

The Ancient Giant King fell, crashing into the realm.

At this moment, silence reigned in all directions.

Su Yu, indifferent, coldly said, "Who gave you the courage to question me? To provoke me? This punch is a small punishment and a big warning! If it happens again, you will die!"

Silence in all directions.

Moments later, near the Eastern Rift Valley in the Human Realm, someone coldly said, "Su Yu, you're too arrogant..."

It wasn't the Hundred Battle King.

It was a Heavenly Venerable!

Su Yu actually didn't give face to the Hundred Battle King, directly injuring the Ancient Giant King with a punch. Su Yu wasn't unaware of the relationship between the Hundred Battle King and the Ancient Giant King. Strictly speaking, the Hundred Battle King had to call the Ancient Giant King his father-in-law.

And at this moment, Su Yu's cold voice echoed, "Do you want to start a war with me? The Hundred Battle King hasn't spoken yet, and you, a bold madman without respect, dare to question this emperor?"

At this moment, winds surged, and strands of the power of laws descended in that direction!

Boom!

The sky shattered, as if countless giant hands were reaching out to capture that side.

Su Yu shouted, "Go, kill him!"

Boom!

Three massive figures instantly broke through the air.

Fat Ball, Lantian, and Tongtian arrived almost instantaneously through Marquis Tongtian's portal. As soon as Fat Ball appeared, it turned pitch black and smashed a boot down on the speaker!

Behind them, Hundred Battle did not make a move. A group of people silently watched.

The speaker swung his sword, but as soon as he did, the sword froze. In the next moment, a boot descended from the sky, smashing his head open with a thunderous crash, blood splattering into the void!

The crowd behind him turned pale.

So powerful!

The blackened Fat Ball was indeed formidable, especially with the Culture King's boot, making it terrifyingly strong. It was about to swallow the opponent whole!

At that moment, Hundred Battle suddenly reached out and said softly, "It's all a misunderstanding."

A massive hand reached for the sky!

It was also incomparably powerful!

However, in that instant, Marquis Tongtian's portal opened, and a roar echoed from within. A gigantic Pulao Beast emerged, but Hundred Battle merely raised an eyebrow and slapped it, shattering the beast's shadow.

Then, reaching out, he suddenly grabbed a portal from the void!

Marquis Tongtian's expression changed!

The portal was his true form!

He had been caught!

Just as Marquis Tongtian was about to struggle, Hundred Battle released him, gently flicking the portal aside, as if it was nothing. Hundred Battle then reached out and grabbed the long-browed man, who was nearly bitten to death by Fat Ball, bringing him back with a soft voice, "Longbrow was rude and has been punished. Fellow Daoist Su, let's leave it at that."

Tongtian, Lantian, and Fat Ball all wore solemn expressions.

Hundred Battle... so strong!

This time, Su Yu had intended to test him. In fact, Lantian understood immediately; it was a deliberate attempt to probe Hundred Battle's strength and their side's capabilities.

The result was that after Hundred Battle truly made a move... they found they couldn't fathom his strength!

Unimaginably powerful!

Even after Marquis Tongtian had devoured the portal, he hadn't fully digested it, yet he was already strong. However, Hundred Battle easily extracted his true form and casually flicked it aside.

He was a Heavenly Venerable!

How many in the current Myriad Realms could do that?

At least Chaos Dragon and Moon Battle couldn't!

Lantian instantly realized that Hundred Battle's strength was beyond their probing unless they went to war now. Lantian beamed, "Then let's leave it at that. Since King Hundred Battle has intervened, we'll drop the matter. His Majesty Emperor Yu only intended a minor punishment."

With that, he smiled, "Lord King Hundred Battle, we... shall take our leave!"

The three powerful beings vanished in an instant.

Marquis Tongtian, still shaken, hurriedly opened a portal, and with a flash, the three disappeared completely.

In place.

The group was somewhat solemn.

Longbrow, whose face had been smashed open by a boot, was also shaken, gritting his teeth, "Your Majesty, they are too arrogant!"

Hundred Battle raised his hand slightly, interrupting him, and said softly, "What do you think of these three?"

Evergreen spoke softly, "That dog is the Culture King's dog, calling itself Fat Ball. I see its form... it's not the white one from the legends but black, resembling the Sun Devouring Divine Dog from records! Very strong, and that boot... likely the Culture King's boot! The Culture King did lose a boot back then and even walked barefoot for a while! Among us, perhaps only Wujie and Moon Luo have a chance to fight it!"

Moon Luo was undoubtedly strong, and Wujie, as Hundred Battle's top general, was also formidable, still having hope for a fight.

Evergreen continued, "As for Marquis Tongtian... his presence is optional, his combat power average, but extremely troublesome, making him difficult to deal with! And the one who spoke later..."

He looked at Marquis Yunshui, who lowered his head and said, "It's Lantian!"

"Lantian? The one for whom Su Yu burned his lifespan to pave the way?"

Evergreen was silent for a moment before saying, "Progressing rapidly. Last time, rumors said he was dead, but clearly, it was just a rumor! He's still alive, not only alive but has reached the Heavenly Venerable level. As for his exact strength, since he didn't make a move, it's unclear!"

Three Heavenly Venerables appeared, and Longbrow's face was instantly smashed open.

Su Yu, just for a word.

Was it due to a bad temper or something else?

At this moment, even Marquis Zhennan hadn't returned, yet those three arrived first.

Su Yu knew the relationship between the Giant King and Hundred Battle, yet he was unceremonious, injuring the Giant King with a punch. This was their first direct encounter with Su Yu, and it wasn't a pleasant one.

Su Yu opened the passage between the Upper and Lower Realms, injured the Giant King, and sent people to kill Longbrow... no matter how you looked at it, Su Yu didn't seem easy to deal with!

At this moment, some were angry, and some were apprehensive.

In an instant, three Heavenly Venerables arrived.

Terrifying!

Knowing Hundred Battle was here, they still came. Su Yu had strong control over these Heavenly Venerables.

Three Heavenly Venerables, probably not all under Su Yu.

Su Yu himself wouldn't be weak either.

Is this still a young man?

...

Above the Sea of Stars.

Su Yu punched the Giant King, not even sparing him a glance, quickly returning to his work. By the time Tongtian and the others returned, Su Yu had already shattered the second rebellious power of laws!

Below, as the two powers of laws dissipated, amidst the swirling winds and clouds, a massive figure faintly emerged from the void, seemingly struggling.

Martial Emperor!

He was also preparing to break the seal!

"Very strong!"

Lantian returned with just that sentence, saying no more. Very strong, meaning he couldn't probe or discern how far Hundred Battle had reached.

Su Yu didn't respond.

One token after another appeared, continuing to devour those powers of laws!

Rumbling!

Thunder roared, shaking the heavens and earth.

In the distance, the newly created continent by the Nine Realms experts was also shaking with the slight aura leaking from the Martial Emperor!

On the continent.

The Nine Realms experts trembled.

Moments later, an Eternal sighed in despair, grabbing a few people beside him and transmitting, "Let's go home! Tell the descendants never to create continents again. Let's just stay quietly in our realm!"

Go home!

This continent is doomed.

As long as Su Yu lives, we can forget about creating continents for a lifetime. It's not that Su Yu is deliberately stopping us; he doesn't even bother. But these experts know that even if Su Yu doesn't care, a casual move from him could completely shatter their continent!

Forget it, go home, and don't bother with this!

The Allheaven Battlefield has nothing good!

Go home and stay there!

Knowing Su Yu was here, everyone gave up. In the blink of an eye, a group of experts fled, each returning to their own home. This continent, once Su Yu is done, will probably be gone too, and everyone understood that.

...

Su Yu indeed didn't care.

Those were trivial matters!

Sunmoon and Eternal, he couldn't be bothered to look at them now. Creating continents or not had nothing to do with him.

At this moment, Su Yu focused on devouring the powers of the Great Dao.

Each time a power of laws was shattered, the tremors below grew stronger, and the Martial Emperor was also gathering strength, preparing to break the seal.

Meanwhile, Su Yu was also devouring the imprints left by these rulers of laws.

It was a preliminary understanding!

A general understanding of their realms back then, insights, and the rules of the Great Dao—these were essential intelligence to gather.

As for Hundred Battle, he was ignored for now.

Just didn't want to hear his people's chatter!

The powers of laws were shattered and devoured one by one.

10, 20, 30...

Boom!

The entire Allheaven Battlefield seemed to be expanding.

Below, the Martial Emperor's body became clearer, as if emerging from the endless void, enormous in size, though... faintly visible, his head was facing downwards.

Su Yu continued to shatter the Great Dao.

40, 50...

When more than half of the Great Dao's powers of laws were shattered, the entire Myriad Realms trembled.

Those familiar knew the Upper Realm was about to fully open!

Rumbling!

The battlefield expanded, and at this moment, Su Yu clearly saw the entire Allheaven Battlefield expanding, previously compressed, now the Sea of Stars spreading, the four poles of the compass extending!

The ground shook, mountains swayed!

A large amount of power of laws dissipated into the world, source qi boiling.

Below, the Martial Emperor was no longer silent. Suddenly, he roared, and in the first layer of the Luminous Domain Mansion, his tightly closed eyes suddenly opened, like the sun and moon!

In his eyes, there was ferocity, madness.

I'm breaking the seal!

"Taishan!"

It was as if he had returned to the past, but today, it wasn't just Su Yu who heard it; it was the entire Myriad Realms, everyone hearing this furious shout!

With madness!

With anger!

At this moment, one could even feel the Martial Emperor's crazed desire to kill.

"Taishan!"

Boom!

Waves surged, exploding with a thunderous roar, and the continent created by the Nine Realms earlier turned to dust!

Martial Emperor!

A powerful existence!

At this moment, even Su Yu vaguely felt he might have underestimated the Martial Emperor. His strength after unsealing was even more formidable than imagined.

Indeed, without truly engaging, one wouldn't know their exact strength.

Purely from now, even without unsealing, the opponent's aura was boundless.

Boom!

The Martial Emperor's head struggled, and in the first layer of the Luminous Domain Mansion, everything turned to dust, except for a face, now clearly visible, filled with anger and madness.

Su Yu continued to shatter the Great Dao.

And at this moment, the River of Time also trembled violently. The Martial Emperor's Great Dao that Su Yu saw that day now had chains appearing, starting to break!

...

In the Martial Emperor's Great Dao, there were many chains, completely locking him.

But over the years, he had shattered some, and now, with his consciousness clear and the suppression of the Myriad Realms fading, he seized the opportunity to break countless chains!

"I'm coming out!"

The Martial Emperor's roar echoed through the sky!

Boom!

The river's waters shook violently!

Around the Martial Emperor's Great Dao, the waters trembled madly!

The Human Emperor had sealed this segment of the River of Time, preventing anyone from reaching the ruler of laws realm, but the Martial Emperor didn't need to break through; he was already a ruler of laws.

In this era, he emerged from his seal, a time when the suppression of the Human Emperor's seal was at its weakest.

...

At this moment, in the Upper Realm.

The Divine Empress's eyes flickered as she murmured, "This era... it seems the seal has weakened!"

Beside her, the Sun Corona Heavenly Venerable was slightly taken aback, and Jiwu quickly asked, "Empress... what do you mean?"

The Divine Empress, once a ruler of laws, had chosen to sever her own path to remain awake in the Myriad Realms, unlike the Martial Emperor and the Undead Emperor, who retained their realms despite the seal. She had broken her path and cultivated anew, quickly becoming a Heavenly Venerable once more.

Today, she sensed something different. The Divine Empress murmured, "Perhaps... I can continue along my old path!"

Her eyes shifted, while the Sun Corona's expression changed. He quickly transmitted, "Empress, do you mean... you can advance?"

Others couldn't, but could the Divine Empress?

The Divine Empress wasn't sure; she only had a vague feeling. "The Martial Emperor is breaking his seal, causing the River of Time to tremble. My path isn't too far from his! By borrowing the power of his trembling path, perhaps... I can continue my path!"

Her eyes flickered with uncertainty. "I don't know if it's truly possible, but... I want to try! Sun Corona, our Divine Race is on the brink of disaster, so I want to try! But if I fail, the backlash from the path will likely lead to my complete demise!"

Sun Corona's expression changed drastically!

"Eclipse's injuries haven't healed, and I am merely lingering on... only capable of one full-strength battle. Once that battle is over, I will fall... Sun Corona, such days are too tormenting!"

"So I want to try!"

"If I fail... you should join the Immortal Race, or... join Su Yu!"

The Divine Empress's gaze was extremely complex. "I will descend to the lower realms to see. The power of the path is clearer there. If I fail... don't come looking for me, don't collect my body. If the Divine Emperor returns, tell him I've waited too long and can't wait any longer."

"Empress!"

Sun Corona was shaken, but the Divine Empress smiled. "The opportunity is right in front of us. If we miss it, it's gone! I'm continuing my path, not creating a new one, so there's still hope!"

With those words, she broke through the void. Over there, several strong figures of the Immortal Race changed their expressions, but the Divine Empress's voice echoed, "I am going to break the seal. If I succeed, I will become a ruler of laws. If I fail, I will fall! Tiangu, in my absence, the Divine Race... will follow your lead!"

In the crowd, Tiangu was slightly shaken and said in a deep voice, "Then... I wish the Divine Empress success in continuing her path!"

If she succeeded, the Myriad Races would have a ruler of laws!

As for the Saint Marquis and others, they had no way, but the Divine Empress still had a great chance.

...

Su Yu was still breaking the path.

As he was doing so, suddenly, a rumbling sound echoed from the endless void corresponding to the Soul Burying Mountain. The next moment, a broken figure appeared in the Myriad Realms.

Su Yu's expression changed slightly!

In the distance.

The Divine Empress walked step by step, looking at the struggling Martial Emperor, then at Su Yu, and slightly bowed, "This old one... wishes to take this opportunity to continue my path! If I succeed, I will break through! If I fail, I will fall! If I fail, nothing more needs to be said. If I succeed, Emperor Yu may make one request, and this old one will do my utmost to fulfill it!"

Su Yu frowned.

The Divine Empress wanted to continue her path!

Should he agree?

If he didn't agree, he could expel her now, or even kill her.

"The Myriad Races..."

Su Yu murmured, considering whether to allow the Myriad Races to have a ruler of laws.

He fell into deep thought for a long time before saying in a deep voice, "Do not interfere with me, nor with the Martial Emperor! Success or failure depends on your luck!"

"Thank you!"

The Divine Empress said no more and quickly flew toward the Divine Realm. Su Yu had agreed.

And Su Yu's expression changed for a moment.

Very well!

Let the situation become even more chaotic. The Divine Empress, one condition...

Hopefully, it won't have any impact. This is creating an enemy for himself, a powerful enemy. Su Yu was also conflicted for a moment. If Hundred Battle King was willing to cooperate, he wouldn't give the Divine Empress a chance to shine.

But now... whatever.

At this moment, Su Yu shouted, "Prepare, I am going to break all the power of laws!"

Boom!

The heavens and earth trembled. At this moment, the Martial Emperor's roar echoed, "Break it!"

Su Yu said no more and instantly broke the last power of laws.

Boom!

A massive sound shook the entire heavens and earth, causing the Myriad Realms to tremble madly.

At the same time, in the void, a massive body completely appeared, the body of the Martial Emperor!

He was indeed hung upside down in the void!

Not only that, but black smoke seemed to be rising from behind him, which was actually not smoke but a passage to the Death Realm. There was also a passage to the Death Realm here!

And his legs were indeed spread apart, stretched straight!

A "T" shape!

Miserable!

The Martial King and others were truly ruthless.

And on his legs, a massive palace secret realm was set up.

That was the eighth and ninth floors of the Luminous Domain Mansion.

The Human Emperor and others were also treacherous.

They lived in the palace themselves, but everyone from the first to the seventh floor lived inside the Martial Emperor.

And the Martial Emperor opened his eyes and saw all this. At this moment, he went completely mad.

He knew before, but he hadn't seen his situation with his own eyes.

Only at this moment did he realize what he had truly encountered.

"Taishan!"

A mournful roar, a mad roar, shook the entire Sea of Stars, causing massive waves to sweep across the heavens and earth, devouring countless source qi!

Even Su Yu felt a bit of sympathy for him.

He quickly recorded it secretly, otherwise, if the Martial Emperor saw it, he might kill him.

My heavens!

This posture was too miserable.

Su Yu didn't know what to say.

"Break!"

The Martial Emperor's furious roar echoed through the heavens and earth. At this moment, even the Upper Realm could hear his angry roar. His head rose from the ground, and as his long hair was pulled out, it revealed black holes, which were also passages to the Death Realm.

The River of Time trembled violently!

The chains that had sealed him began to break one by one. The Martial Emperor rose from the ground, and in an instant, his body returned, standing in the void, his long hair flying, though somewhat sparse, as much had been pulled out.

He roared fiercely, punching through the heavens and earth, tearing the river apart, and instantly diving into the river.

Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened, and he immediately saw the Martial Emperor, following his own path, madly attacking along the way. Within the path, chains were shattered into pieces by him!

The massive shockwave affected the entire heavens and earth. At this moment, Su Yu vaguely sensed that in the Death Realm, the Undead Emperor seemed to be taking advantage of the River of Time's turbulence, even the interference with the Death Path, to begin breaking his seal!

The Undead Emperor was also starting to break his seal!

Not only that, but at this moment, in the Divine Realm, the former Empress's expression changed. The next moment, she tore the river apart with one palm, taking advantage of the Martial Emperor's attack, causing the river to tremble. Her broken path began to reconnect!

She also wanted to take this opportunity to break her seal and become a ruler of laws!

Three great powerhouses all chose this moment to break their seals, or rather, this was their only chance.

The Divine Empress also took the opportunity to enter the river, the massive waves crashing against her. Her path was broken, but at this moment, she disregarded everything, burning everything, using the last of her life force to reconnect this path.

If she couldn't connect it, she would die.

If she connected it, she would become a ruler of laws, and everything she burned could be restored.

"Break!"

The Martial Emperor's angry roar echoed once more. He had already reached the end of his path, just a little bit more, but this little bit was like a chasm, blocking him. At this moment, a light curtain blocked the end of the tributary.

"No..."

The Martial Emperor's desperate roar echoed. He punched and punched, his hands covered in blood, yet he couldn't break the seal. He couldn't believe it. What was this?

Who was blocking him?

Why?

He wanted to break the seal!

Why couldn't he?

At this moment, Su Yu also instantly tore the river apart, glanced over, and slightly frowned. Quickly, he reached out, and from somewhere, a projection of a great seal appeared out of thin air.

Su Yu shouted, "By the order of the Human Lord, I pardon the Martial Emperor, witnessed by heaven and earth, break the seal!"

At this moment, the Human Lord Seal shone brightly!

Illuminating the Myriad Realms!

A great seal suppressed the heavens, suppressed the river, and the Human Lord Seal erupted with brilliant light. A beam of light shot out, striking the membrane at the end of the Martial Emperor's path!

Boom!

With a loud noise, the membrane, originally unbreakable, was shattered by this beam of light!

The Martial Emperor was stunned. The next moment, he couldn't care about anything else, and his body instantly emerged from the path.

Countless waters of the river were devoured by him madly, and his aura became incomparably powerful in the blink of an eye!

The water flow of this section of the river was instantly cut off, directly sucked dry by him!

Not far away, a tributary path, originally hopeless to reconnect, but as the Martial Emperor sucked the river dry, over there, the Divine Empress let out a fierce cry, her white hair falling, boom!

A monstrous aura rose over there!

The Martial Emperor continued to devour the river's water madly, not bothering to pay attention, not even looking, but quickly strengthening himself. His peripheral vision glanced at Su Yu, gritting his teeth. Damn it, the Human Emperor had actually intervened. There was actually a seal from the Human Emperor in his seal, which he hadn't discovered before!

He almost failed!

What a Human Emperor!

A treacherous villain!

And Su Yu, however, sighed. The Human Emperor... was still formidable.

The Martial Emperor actually had a seal personally set by the Human Emperor.

Without the Human Lord Seal, the Martial Emperor probably wouldn't have been able to break the seal. This meant that the Human Emperor had left a backup plan to restrain the Martial Emperor. Without the Human Lord's permission, no matter how powerful the Martial Emperor was, he would still be suppressed!

This was reliable. Although he left a mess, the Human Emperor, overall, was still much more reliable!

Rumble!

The entire river trembled violently. Two rulers of laws entered, absorbing a large amount of river water, causing the river to momentarily break, and the ripples began to spread.

...

At this moment.

Upstream of the River of Time, a low curse echoed.

"Damn!"

"Heh heh... The Martial Emperor has died again!"

Someone chuckled. The Martial Emperor had died once more... Forget it, nobody even bothered to ask anymore. Even if they did, the answer would still be that the Martial Emperor had died!

The River of Time trembled once again!

In the distance, a shadowy figure was filled with frustration. Damn it, it seemed like the Martial Emperor had broken free this time. So, he wasn't actually dead before?

Forget it, I must find an opportunity to truly kill the Martial Emperor!
