Chapter 790: Ascending Once More! (Please Subscribe)

Su Yu wasn't overly concerned about Destiny's side. Would Destiny choose to oppose him after Wuming pledged allegiance? Destiny was a smart individual. From the current perspective, the myriad races didn't hold a significant advantage. The crux of the matter was that the myriad races lacked a true top-tier leader who could unite them all. Just like the Human Realm, without a Human Lord, unity was elusive. The myriad races needed a Myriad Races Lord, which was even more challenging than having a Human Lord. Unless a true master of the power of laws emerged!

Moreover, Su Yu's strength wasn't weak. If Destiny had any sense, he would know what choice to make.

Su Yu didn't dwell on Destiny any longer. He quickly turned his attention to the Eight-Winged Tiger and smiled, "So, Tiger Brother, are you saying that as long as the one from the Gate of Hell can come out smoothly, you'll be willing to cooperate with me?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger needed the will of chaos. Battling a master of the power of laws wasn't simple. More cooperation meant a higher chance of success.

The Eight-Winged Tiger nodded, then whispered, "However... that master of the power of laws doesn't need you all to take action. The Chaos Dragon and I can handle it. As long as you can deal with the rest of the Control King's lineage, cooperation won't be an issue!"

Even though they knew dealing with a master of the power of laws was difficult, the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon didn't expect others to join them in the fight. Otherwise, it could lead to complications. If these people killed the master of the power of laws and then changed their minds, fearing their advancement and obstructing them, it would be a huge problem. Therefore, he and the Chaos Dragon planned to lead those ancient beasts to encircle and kill that one.

At this moment, Destiny couldn't help but ask, "Then... will the Hundred Battle King and others from the lower realm cause any interference?"

"Don't worry!" Su Yu laughed, "I will soon ascend to the Upper Realm. Once there, I will join forces with the myriad races to seal the passage to the lower realm. I think the myriad races would be happy to see this, wouldn't they?"

Destiny was startled. Seal the passage? Well, Su Yu could traverse through chaos, so it seemed feasible.

Su Yu calculated that if the Eight-Winged Tiger was willing to cooperate, many troubles could be avoided. However, if he could lure people into his own world, the chances of success would be greater! The only fear was being exposed. But even if exposed, it wouldn't have much impact. At worst, no one would come, and that wouldn't be a loss.

Thinking of this, Su Yu smiled, "Tiger Brother, I might have some other plans soon, like luring people into my world. It would make dealing with them easier! For this, I might need your cooperation."

The Eight-Winged Tiger pondered for a moment, quickly understanding Su Yu's intention, and said, "This... isn't impossible. However, Emperor Su, I still want to clarify in advance that even if we cooperate... the master of the power of laws must be dealt with by us!"

"Of course!" Su Yu laughed, "I would love that. A master of the power of laws, whose depth is unknown, I would rather you deal with them! By the way, I won't go to the Chaos Dragon's side. After all, I was the one who broke its tail. I'm worried that guy will pick a fight with me! Tiger Brother, you handle it. You have some connections, after all."

The Eight-Winged Tiger nodded. After thinking for a moment, he looked at Su Yu and suddenly asked a profound question, "What is Emperor Su's ultimate goal?"

Ultimate goal? Just to keep fighting chaotically like this? Of course not!

Su Yu chuckled, took a sip of tea, and said unhurriedly, "In this era, myriad paths converge, myriad dynasties gather, and various eras flow together! Countless strong individuals, and it's not uncommon to see those who have opened the heavens. Goal? If I say my goal is for what should disappear to disappear, what should die to die, and what should appear to appear... for the unification of the myriad paths, would you believe me?"

The Eight-Winged Tiger fell into deep thought, nodding after a moment, "For one who opens the heavens, such ambition is normal! But..."

"But my strength is too low!" Su Yu laughed, "So, it's just a thought! Currently, I have one goal: to pacify the chaos of the Myriad Realms before the return of the Human Emperor and the myriad races' masters of the power of laws, to face the upcoming turmoil in the best and strongest state! Over a hundred masters of the power of laws left back then. How many have survived? Some ancient marquises also left with them, almost all top-tier ancient marquises left. Out of 1,080 ancient marquises, two-thirds left. How many have advanced?"

Among the ancient marquises, a total of 1,080, at least 600 were taken away, leaving only the weak ones in the Myriad Realms. The truly powerful ones, those who reached the Heavenly King domain, or even the second tier, were almost all taken away! How many of these people have advanced to become masters of the power of laws? On the Human Emperor's side, there were clearly no advancement restrictions. Upon their return, how many masters of the power of laws will there be? This is unknown.

Therefore, if the Myriad Realms remain in their current state before their return, the current strong individuals will become cannon fodder because they aren't even masters of the power of laws, unworthy of the stage. The Human Emperor's disdain for Xingyue's words was based on this point; over there, it's a war of masters of the power of laws! The Myriad Realms haven't even broken the seal yet. In truth, the Human Emperor and others have given up hope. Delaying is merely waiting, perhaps waiting for the Culture King and others to return!

And what Su Yu wants to do is to pacify the Myriad Realms before their return, even taking the initiative to lead people to attack!

The Eight-Winged Tiger's eyes changed. Destiny's heart also stirred. Su Yu's talk of pacifying the Myriad Realms was probably not a joke. And Su Yu continued to smile, "Currently, it's just an appetizer! Next, it's the era of the masters of the power of laws! If you can't keep up with the times, you'll be eliminated! So, Tiger Brother, if you want to advance to become a master of the power of laws... as long as you don't oppose me after advancing, I won't care whether you advance or not!"

"You belong to the Chaos Era. Currently, chaos hasn't conflicted with us yet!"

"In the Death Realm, the Undead Emperor is also a master of the power of laws. Can we kill him? We have the capability, but... why bother?"

Su Yu laughed, "The Martial Emperor is sealed. I can kill him now, but is it necessary?"

"Not necessary for now!"

"This era has just begun!"

"No, the opening ceremony hasn't even ended!"

Yes, their battle with the myriad races is just the opening ceremony! Su Yu's face was full of a bright smile, "So, this era is destined to be very interesting, and I refuse to remain obscure in this era of myriad paths contending. First, I'll kill some of the more troublesome ones to practice!"

The two looked at him, and after a long time, the Eight-Winged Tiger nodded, "I think I understand Emperor Su's meaning! Before the Gate of Hell opens, I don't think I'll have much conflict with Emperor Su!"

"That's for the best!"

Su Yu laughed, stood up, and said, "I won't say more! Whether you betray me or sincerely cooperate with me, I think the only difference is how many of my people die. As for myself... it's probably hard to kill me now!"

He stood up, smiling, "Lantian, leave a clone here to communicate with Tiger Brother, so it's easier to coordinate."

Lantian left a clone, which quickly transformed into a stone and fell into the corner of the wall, smiling, "Tiger Sovereign, if you need anything, feel free to call me!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger's forehead twitched, nodding, "Alright!"

Su Yu stepped into the air, ready to leave. Destiny couldn't help but ask, "Your Majesty... what about me..."

"Three days later, go find Wuming yourself! Outside Chaos Mountain, I'll arrange for someone to guide you!"

Alright! Destiny nodded, watching Su Yu and Lantian leave. After they left, Destiny glanced at Lantian's clone in the corner and sighed, "A frog at the bottom of a well, it turns out His Majesty has long jumped out of the current Myriad Realms."

Su Yu was now thinking about what would happen after the Human Emperor and others returned, about the convergence of the myriad paths. Yet many strong individuals were still simply pondering who would be the boss of the Myriad Realms.

The Eight-Winged Tiger said nothing, watching Su Yu and the others leave, then looked at Destiny, smiling, "Then the Venerable can report back to the myriad races. Cooperation is possible, but not now! Specifically, how the Venerable says it, I won't teach! Don't mention the appearance of a master of the power of laws, otherwise, the myriad races will certainly obstruct... which wouldn't be in our interest!"

If they said now that a master of the power of laws was going to appear, but a war broke out now, and the Control King's lineage had no chance to bring them out, the myriad races might act in advance. This would conflict with the interests of the Eight-Winged Tiger and others!

Destiny nodded slightly. These days, everyone had their own calculations. Indeed, he was a bit old. The Fate Clan probably couldn't remain neutral either. Wuming's choice of Su Yu was likely a well-considered decision.

"I'll talk to Wuming and see!"

Destiny Marquis thought to himself. Now, all sides were calculating and plotting. On the surface, the myriad races seemed the strongest, but in reality, that might not be the case.

...

At this moment, Su Yu had already left Chaos Mountain. He didn't wander around. Chaos was dangerous, and wandering around could lead to getting lost, which would be troublesome. He needed to return to the Death Realm. With the current route he had explored, he could disguise the entire world and move it here, allowing him to summon his subordinates to assist in battle promptly. He had to act quickly!

The news from the Eight-Winged Tiger gave Su Yu a sense of urgency. The Gate of Hell could actually produce a master of the power of laws. Although it seemed difficult, it was a sign that the Gate of Hell could allow some strong individuals to enter and exit. The relationship between the Control King's lineage and the chaotic ancient beasts was complex. The chaotic ancient beasts outside were not strictly part of the same group as those inside, and the Control King's lineage might have some dealings with the beasts inside. Otherwise, how could the beasts transport a master of the power of laws from the Control King's lineage out?

"The Gate of Hell is about to open, and I don't even know where the Heaven Gate's main body is. The Gate of Hell's composition is simpler, all ancient beasts, but what about inside the Heaven Gate?"

"The Heaven Gate sealed the Era of Opening the Heavens, and there were too many strong individuals in that era!"

"Master of Time, Lord of the Dead, even the Human Ancestor might be involved... then who are the Culture King and the others fighting against?"

Thoughts flickered through Su Yu's mind.

The situation within the Heaven Gate was likely even more complex than that of the Gate of Hell.

"Who can seal the Era of Opening the Heavens? This era was established by the Master of Time; wouldn't sealing it mean sealing the Master of Time as well?"

"And sealing an era... does it mean sealing all the powerful beings of that era, or what?"

"What does it mean to seal an era?"

"Where did the gate come from?"

"......"

These countless questions remained unanswered for Su Yu.

This only made Su Yu feel more urgency!

Time was running out.

He didn't want to be a small fry when the myriad paths converged. After struggling for so long and finally establishing a foothold in the Myriad Realms, becoming a top-tier existence, he didn't want to find himself at the bottom again at this critical moment. That was not the outcome he desired!

"I must accelerate!"

"Behind Hundred Battle might be the Human Ancestor, the myriad races have over a hundred rulers of laws backing them, the Control King's lineage has the Chaos Ancient Clan behind them, and I... am I supposed to rely on the Human Emperor?"

Su Yu chuckled bitterly!

Indeed, all the major factions now had their backers.

But he, in fact, did not.

Who could he rely on?

The Human Emperor?

If he truly encountered the Human Emperor, who knew what the situation would be.

Thus, the myriad races were not in a hurry; if they couldn't win, they could just wait for their powerful beings to return!

The Control King's lineage wasn't in a hurry either; they could wait for the Gate of Hell to open.

Even Hundred Battle might not be in such a rush; if things didn't work out, they could wait for the Human Ancestor to return!

Goodness, when it came down to it, only Su Yu had no one to wait for.

Wait for the Human Emperor?

They weren't even familiar!

And there wasn't much of a relationship, not to mention that the Human Emperor was currently at a disadvantage!

This was a crucial reason why Su Yu had to step forward and continue stirring the winds and clouds!

He had long seen through all of this!

Everyone else had a reason to wait, but he did not!

Together with Lantian, he transformed into an ancient beast and returned outside Chaos Mountain, leaving the South King and others to keep watch. Su Yu needed to shift the heavens and earth over.

...

Two days later.

As Su Yu shifted the heavens and earth, he encountered some ancient beasts along the way, but he was unceremonious, killing any he came across!

Soon enough.

Outside Chaos Mountain, in the endless void, a somewhat dilapidated continent stood in the void.

No longer did myriad paths manifest, but instead, the aura of chaos flowed!

Su Yu no longer organized the power of myriad paths within the heavens and earth, allowing the chaotic aura to surge.

At this moment, the dilapidated continent was filled with powerful beings.

Su Yu had almost mobilized all the strong individuals he could, leaving only a few to guard the Abyssal Realm, and he hardly paid attention to the Death Realm.

The earth cracked open!

Revealing the Great Dao Map below, Su Yu didn't waste words, directly saying, "Everyone hide within the Great Dao Map to conceal your tracks! Tea Plant, you should be planted on this Great Dao Map, and South King, you should unleash your aura to disguise it as the Tea Plant's aura! Intimidate the ancient beasts, don't let them approach easily!"

"Disguise the Tea Plant a bit, make it different from before!"

Everyone nodded, and Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "The one who should be most cautious is Your Majesty yourself. Going to the Upper Realm may not be safe!"

"I know!"

Su Yu smiled and said, "No worries, I'm bringing quite a few strong individuals this time!"

Su Yu looked at someone in the crowd, raising an eyebrow slightly, "General Xuelan, come with me. I'll be going to the Upper Realm with Giant Axe and the others. General Xuelan, everyone knows you left with March, so disappearing wouldn't be good!"

In the crowd, General Xuelan's face was cold. Upon hearing this, she frowned slightly but soon calmed down and said, "Alright!"

"Everyone else, use this time to cultivate well!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "I've opened up the permissions of the Human Lord Seal to Director Wan and Lantian. If anyone wants to comprehend the source of the Great Dao, you can apply to do so, but remember, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis is still sealed inside, don't let him out!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "Rest assured!"

Su Yu said no more. This time, besides Giant Axe and the others, he brought only one person below the Heavenly King level, Tongtian!

Marquis Tongtian had to be brought along.

This guy could teleport them to any place at any time.

...

Myriad Realms.

The three-day deadline set by Su Yu was fast approaching.

The sealed three great realms were now also showing signs of unrest, with a tendency to break the seal.

Su Yu's requirement was for everyone to converge in the endless void.

At this moment, the powerful beings of the three great realms were contemplating whether to break the seal.

In fact, they had long made up their minds.

But when the moment truly arrived, there was still some hesitation.

In this hesitation and silence, suddenly, a thunderous sound erupted!

Above the Immortal Realm, a layer of barrier seemed to shatter!

In the next moment, figures broke through the void, Tiangu wearing a crown, exuding a powerful aura, with the Symbol King and other strong individuals standing behind him, more than one Daofuse Realm expert.

Many!

Hanxiang, Jade King, Wind King, Thunder King...

At this moment, behind Tiangu, eight Daofuse Realm experts appeared!

This was the result of him opening up the Great Dao, no longer restricting others from advancing. Besides the Symbol King, in a short time, the Immortal Clan had produced seven Daofuse Realm experts!

In addition to these Daofuse experts, there were more than a dozen top-tier Eternals.

Including Tiangu, over twenty strong individuals emerged from the Immortal Realm this time.

These top-tier Eternals, unable to reach Daofuse in the lower realm, had a great hope of advancing to Daofuse in the Upper Realm, where the Great Dao's suppression was less severe.

At the same time, the void of the Devil Realm shattered.

Figures appeared!

Demon Halberd, Demon Leap appeared one after another, followed by a group of strong individuals, with deep foundations.

Even a young expert who seemed to have vaguely stepped into the Daofuse Realm, Modona, who had dominated the Hunting Heaven List for years, had also vaguely reached the Daofuse Realm at this moment.

At this moment, everyone turned their gaze to the Divine Realm.

The void of the Divine Realm also shattered.

Jiwu emerged, followed by five Daofuse Realm experts, but at this moment, everyone looked towards the Divine Realm.

Within the Divine Realm, an ancient existence with an incredibly powerful aura gradually emerged.

It was an old woman.

Her hair was completely silver.

Old and frail, at this moment, her aura was unstable, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, as she withdrew her Great Dao power from the Divine Realm. As soon as the old woman stepped out of the Divine Realm, her Great Dao power seemed to become unstable.

March, Giant Axe, Thunderstorm, and several other strong individuals quickly arrived near the Divine Realm, and Jiwu and the others were all very vigilant.

However, the old woman at the entrance of the Divine Realm's passage didn't say anything, just smiled at them and nodded slightly.

March and the others also nodded slightly.

This one was truly ancient.

The Dao companion of the Divine Emperor!

Back then, when the Divine Emperor and the others were taken away by the Human Emperor, the Dao companions of other strong individuals either died in battle or died of old age, but this one survived, always protecting the Divine Clan.

"Former Empress..."

Jiwu was somewhat worried, "If you leave the realm... it might be difficult to suppress..."

"No worries!"

The old woman smiled and still took a step out. At this moment, it seemed as if thunder was forming in the sky.

And at this moment, blood-red tokens appeared in the void, dispersing the thunder.

In the next moment, a portal appeared.

Su Yu, Fat Ball, Tongtian, and Xuelan appeared.

Su Yu dispersed the thunder, looked at the old woman, and smiled, "So that's how it is!"

The old woman also looked at Su Yu, chuckling, "Emperor Yu, you flatter me!"

Su Yu smiled, "The Empress truly impresses me! With such foundations, if it weren't for the Human Emperor's seal, the Empress would have long advanced to become a ruler of laws!"

After speaking, Su Yu seemed a bit puzzled but soon smiled, "Something's not quite right... could it be that the Empress has long been a ruler of laws?"

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked.

Su Yu smiled, "Why do I feel... as if the Empress has long advanced to become a ruler of laws, but to avoid the rules, she switched to a different path, severing her original path, and another path has reached its end, restricted by the rules, unable to become a ruler of laws?"

Su Yu smiled, "Whether it's the Martial Emperor or the Death Emperor, these people can't come out, or rather, they can only be temporarily sealed, unable to act freely! But the Empress can still move freely!"

Su Yu sighed, "Could it be that to protect the Divine Clan, the Empress didn't choose self-sealing but chose to sever her path and cultivate a new one, reaching the Heavenly Sovereign Realm? Unfortunately, she's a bit old, and having severed the path of rules, her lifespan is insufficient?"

At this moment, the old woman took a deep look at Su Yu.

And the other strong individuals from various factions also arrived, with some suspicion.

Jiwu frowned slightly, looking at Su Yu. Su Yu smiled, "What are you looking at? The Former Empress should have fallen from the ruler of laws realm, and now her lifespan is exhausted. After all, the Divine Emperor is not young, and the Former Empress is older than everyone... actually, it's simple, to recover, kill Tiangu and refine a Longevity Pill, maybe it can extend her life a bit!"

In the distance, Tiangu's expression remained calm, saying nothing.

Su Yu laughed again, "Of course, there's another way, quickly break the seal and let the Empress advance to become a ruler of laws, otherwise, the Empress might not survive March!"

Beside him, March twisted his body.

This statement had many implications.

Would she not survive him, or not survive three months?

The Former Empress looked at Su Yu and chuckled, "Emperor Yu has sharp eyes, seeing through this old one at a glance... Indeed, I advanced to the ruler of laws realm back then, but... the Myriad Realms didn't allow the existence of rulers of laws. Once they appeared, it was the punishment of thunder rules... back then, the rules were much stronger than now, and rulers of laws would also fall! Helpless, I could only sever my path and be reborn..."

Su Yu smiled, "Why not self-seal?"

The Former Empress smiled, "Seal? Why bother! The Martial Emperor and the others were sealed, but they might not be as free as this old one, right?"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "The Empress has great courage. I see that over the years, the Empress hasn't refrained from participating in battles! Not self-sealing, probably to be ready to fight at any time, to protect the Divine Clan? I must say, although the myriad races are my enemies, some among them are still worthy of respect for protecting their races!"

The Former Empress could have sealed herself, no longer emerging, waiting for the seal of the Myriad Realms to break, or living in a limited area.

But she didn't!

She chose to sever her path and cultivate anew!

A remarkable person!

Su Yu glanced around and chuckled, "Not bad! The strength of all parties has improved significantly. Indeed, without pressure, there's no motivation. It seems that without me, you all would struggle to reach the Daofuse Realm! You should be thanking me! Tiangu has become a Heavenly King, Jiwu is almost there, and although Demon Halberd is lagging a bit, he still has a chance..."

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Look at this, haven't you all been cultivating faster in these past few months than in the past hundred thousand years?"

His laughter echoed, but the powerful figures from the three factions had mixed feelings.

It was true! Just as Su Yu said, the pressure was immense, which was one factor. Another reason was that recently, cultivation had indeed sped up. It felt as if the seals of the Myriad Realms were breaking, making it easier to comprehend the Great Dao. Or perhaps, some powerful beings were returning. Their power of laws was becoming more and more fervent.

For instance, the imminent return of the Immortal Emperor had caused the entire Immortal Race's Immortal Emperor Dao to become jubilant. Those cultivating this Dao could feel it; the power of laws was much more active than before, no longer as lifeless!

Su Yu smiled, scanning the crowd, "Fortunately, the three races combined don't even number a hundred! It seems none of you plan to bring your families to the Upper Realm!"

Tiangu replied calmly, "Going to the Upper Realm isn't necessarily safe, so why bring too many people?"

"True!" Su Yu nodded with a smile. At this moment, he turned his head towards the Human Realm. In the sky above, a terrifying presence seemed to hover silently, watching them.

Everyone sensed it. Hundred Battle! He was silently observing.

Su Yu smiled but didn't look for long. He quickly turned back to the crowd, smiling faintly, "Let's get going then!"

"......"

The surroundings fell silent. This sudden declaration of departure made everyone a bit uneasy!

Su Yu glanced at Thunderstorm, teasing, "Thunderstorm Venerable, aren't you bringing some Giant Race experts to the Upper Realm?"

Thunderstorm chuckled, "No need, the Lower Realm is quite safe."

"Then forget it!" Su Yu laughed, stepping into the endless void.

From the God Race, an old woman emerged from the Divine Realm, followed by Jiwu and others, worriedly. Fortunately, after the thunder was dispelled, it did not reappear. Otherwise, the old woman might not have been able to come out.

Her strength had reached a limit, but her unstable Dao suggested that if she acted, she might kill herself before her enemies.

The old woman silently watched Su Yu, her heart heavy. What was this young man's true strength now? Even she couldn't see through him.

Everyone followed quietly. This was the first time they were with Su Yu without fighting or conflict, heading to the Upper Realm together. Was this considered cooperation? Perhaps.

...

Moments later, they reached the Torchbearer's passage.

The crowd looked at the passage Su Yu revealed with a wave of his hand, all slightly surprised. Was Su Yu not hiding it? Wouldn't this passage be exposed once they reached the Upper Realm?

Thunderstorm frowned slightly. He felt something was amiss when Su Yu brought people here, but he couldn't say much now, feeling a bit heavy-hearted. Su Yu was exposing the passage!

Tiangu and the others were even more worried. If the passage was exposed, the one from the Fate Clan wouldn't be as important!

Was Su Yu planning to kill them to silence them?

"Giant Axe, March, go in first, clear any dangers!" Su Yu smiled. The two powerful figures exchanged a glance and quickly ascended. Thunderstorm was about to follow when Su Yu said calmly, "No need for you, Thunderstorm Venerable. Protect the various races to prevent heavy casualties. You wouldn't want to face the Myriad Races with such losses!"

Thunderstorm had to stop. He glanced at Su Yu, hesitating. What was Su Yu's true strength? Wasn't his Dao said to be broken last time? It felt like the Dao was broken, with no Dao fluctuations, yet it didn't seem so.

After Giant Axe and March entered for a while, Su Yu ascended, saying lightly, "Follow me. If you wander off and die, don't blame me!"

At this moment, the former Queen Consort spoke softly, "Is Emperor Yu really going to the Upper Realm with us?"

Su Yu laughed, "Of course. Where I fell, I must rise again! This time in the Upper Realm, I won't rest until I kill those guys! Don't worry, you all stay back. I'll deal with the Control King's lineage first, then come for you... Of course, you can come to me. I don't mind!"

Silence fell over the crowd. Arrogant as ever, Su Yu!

A group of people stepped into the passage, which trembled!

...

Meanwhile, in the Upper Realm.

On Ren Mountain, a group was still discussing matters when suddenly, in the distant Soul Burying Mountain area, waves of energy surged.

Moments later, a group of powerful figures quickly arrived. In no time, two powerful auras erupted without any concealment. March and Giant Axe burst out of the passage.

March laughed loudly, "Mission accomplished! Tiangu's people are in the passage!"

Giant Axe coldly declared, "By His Majesty's order, if the Myriad Races are willing to gather 99 council tokens, we are willing to seal this passage!"

"......"

The Moon Heavenly Venerable and others arrived quickly, their expressions grave. What did this mean? His Majesty? Which Majesty?

The Moon Heavenly Venerable hesitated, "The Majesty Giant Axe refers to is..."

"Emperor Yu!" Giant Axe shouted, "His Majesty will also ascend this time, willing to ally with the Myriad Races to attack the Control King's lineage! To prevent Hundred Battle from causing trouble, we are willing to seal the Soul Burying Mountain passage!"

Upon hearing this, the Desolate Heavenly Venerable was slightly shocked and quickly said in a low voice, "Then why not directly attack the Lower Realm and kill Hundred Battle?"

At that moment, several more auras erupted.

Su Yu stepped out, his aura formidable. Beside him, Fat Ball's aura also surged. Su Yu smiled faintly, "After all, we are both humans. Killing Hundred Battle would tarnish my name. If you want to seal it, seal it. If not... leave it. If you think it's better to kill Hundred Battle first in the Lower Realm... you can try. But..."

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Hundred Battle's subordinates might not be weak! Fighting Hundred Battle might not end well. Hundred Battle himself is extremely powerful... Anyway, I won't cooperate with you to kill Hundred Battle. As for the Control King's side, I'm willing to bring people to cooperate with you this time!"

"You?"

At that moment, a giant dragon broke through the air, furious, "Are you Su Yu? What are you? Many of my race's experts were slaughtered by you..."

"Too much nonsense!" Su Yu shouted coldly, "Take him down!"

Giant Axe, March, and Fat Ball erupted with incredibly powerful auras, instantly attacking the Dragon Race Heavenly Venerable!

The Moon Heavenly Venerable and others were shocked!

Three Heavenly Venerable experts! No, Fat Ball's aura was incredibly powerful, with a boot floating, its aura boundless.

At this moment, the Moon Heavenly Venerable was about to intervene when Su Yu said calmly, "Why should the God Race interfere?"

As he spoke, the Moon Heavenly Venerable was startled. Su Yu had already appeared beside him, pressing down with a palm. The Moon Heavenly Venerable was shocked, and the Dao Heavenly Venerable quickly intervened!

Boom!

The two sides clashed, the Moon Heavenly Venerable and Dao Heavenly Venerable retreated a step, while Su Yu also stepped back slightly. At this moment, Fat Ball swallowed, and a boot struck the opponent, sending the giant dragon flying with a shoe print on its body!

Su Yu laughed, "Showing a bit of strength, so you don't think I'm here to take advantage of you! Including me, four Heavenly Venerables. Is that enough for cooperation?"

"March!" The Moon Heavenly Venerable, shocked, looked at March. March, with a bamboo stick, repelled the Nether Heavenly Venerable, and Giant Axe cleaved the Phoenix Heavenly Venerable. At this moment, March grinned, "I follow His Majesty's orders!"

Everyone was shocked!

March had directly sided with Su Yu!

Moreover, Su Yu's strength had improved again, and rapidly!

At this moment, Su Yu remained calm, saying lightly, "Do you want to cooperate? If so, use the tokens now to seal the Lower Realm. This way, everyone can be at ease, and we can prevent Hundred Battle from stabbing us in the back!"

Everyone looked at each other.

At this moment, more people arrived. The former Queen Consort coughed and said, "Seal it!"

The Moon Heavenly Venerable was startled, quickly looking at the former Queen Consort, and said hurriedly, "Queen Consort..."

"Seal it!"

The Moon Heavenly Venerable's expression changed slightly, but he quickly said, "Alright, our race agrees..."

Over there, Tiangu also flew up, looking at the Immortal Race's Dao Heavenly Venerable and Desolate Heavenly Venerable, nodding slightly, and said flatly, "Seal it! The strength of Hundred Battle's side is unknown. Seal the Lower Realm first!"

Dao Heavenly Venerable frowned slightly. Tiangu looked at them, and the two Heavenly Venerables exchanged a glance, nodding after a while.

Tiangu glanced at them but said nothing more, stepping into the air and heading into the distance, "Talisman King, lead the way!"

"Yes!" The Talisman King quickly led them away.

Dao Heavenly Venerable and Desolate Heavenly Venerable exchanged a glance, both slightly heavy-hearted. Tiangu's arrival... might not be a good thing!

But not coming... staying in the Lower Realm was even worse.

In the Upper Realm, there were many strong supporters of Tiangu. After all, Tiangu was the only king of the Immortal Race, even now.

In the distance, from the Immortal Race, several Heavenly Kings, including the Immortal Battle Marquis, had already arrived, all overjoyed. The Immortal Battle Marquis shouted, "Welcome, Our Emperor!"

There were dozens of Daofuse experts here to welcome him!

Most of these Daofuse experts were true Dao experts, with hardly any pseudo-dao experts.

This was Tiangu's foundation in the Upper Realm!

At this moment, the Desolate Heavenly Venerable and Dao Heavenly Venerable both sighed inwardly, feeling somewhat helpless.

These people came to welcome him without informing them.

Clearly, even though they were Heavenly Venerables, in the Immortal Race, since ancient times, the emperor had always been Tiangu!

"Seal it!"

Several Heavenly Venerables spoke, and at this moment, a total of over 30 tokens floated out.

Su Yu counted them. Including his 60 tokens, there were only 97.

No matter!

A few less wouldn't be a big problem.

The next moment, he directly controlled the tokens, gathering a large amount of the power of laws. The powerful force directly sealed the entire Soul Burying Mountain passage!

Su Yu smiled, and in an instant, the passage disappeared!

...

At the same time.

In the Lower Realm.

A thunderous roar erupted, causing the faces of Hundred Battle and his group in the Human Realm to change slightly. In no time, a group of people swiftly tore through the void. Moments later, as they reached the Endless Void, the passageway faintly vanished, and the booming sound reverberated throughout the entire void.

"Damn it!" 

Everyone was furious. 

Marquis Changmei angrily exclaimed, "They sealed the passage? Damn it, Su Yu really colluded with the myriad races! He actually sealed the passage!" 

This was truly infuriating! 

With this, their difficulty in reaching the Upper Realm had increased significantly. Should they take the Fate Clan's passage? That was far too dangerous!

Hundred Battle remained silent, looking up at the sky. Su Yu's actions had taken him by surprise. He actually sealed the passage! Did he think he didn't need their help? Did he believe he could pacify the Upper Realm on his own?

According to Hundred Battle's thoughts, even if Su Yu went to the Upper Realm, he might seek their assistance at a critical moment. But no, he directly cut off the retreat, sealing the Lower Realm. Su Yu... had closed off the Lower Realm!

He was more on guard against them!

...

At this moment, in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu retrieved his token, and the other tokens flew out on their own. Su Yu laughed, "If you want to open the Lower Realm, first deal with the Control King's lineage! Everyone, see you later!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, taking a few people with him as they stepped into the void.

March's voice echoed, "I hope my clan members can be sent back to Bamboo Mountain!"

The Heavenly Sovereigns remained silent. Su Yu's side actually had four Heavenly Sovereigns now.

At this moment, Thunderstorm was about to follow Su Yu, but Su Yu's voice resonated, "Thunderstorm, you stay here, remain on Ren Mountain, and report any information to me at any time! When it comes to dealing with the Control King's lineage, let Thunderstorm be the vanguard. The myriad races can leave the troublesome tasks to Thunderstorm!"

"..."

Silence.

Thunderstorm was silent for a moment, his expression changing. Damn it! This guy really was something!

At this moment, the others also had strange expressions, all looking at Thunderstorm. Su Yu's implication was clear... Thunderstorm, he couldn't care less. He wasn't really on the same side as Hundred Battle and wouldn't care about Hundred Battle's people!

Wasn't that the implication?

This Human race was also full of internal strife.

In this way, Thunderstorm was in a difficult position. Not listening to the myriad races, not listening to Su Yu, and with Hundred Battle stuck in the Lower Realm, this... this left Thunderstorm in the Upper Realm, unloved by anyone!

At this moment, everyone silently watched Su Yu leave.

Some, like Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, were impulsive and wanted to make a move, but the opponent's strength was formidable. They had just been defeated in an instant, making them realize they were powerless to act.

If a great battle were to break out, the other side had four Heavenly Sovereign-level beings, and both Fat Ball and Su Yu were very strong. If they really fought, even if they won, the losses would be severe.

In an instant, Su Yu's side had intimidated them!

As for Demon Halberd and the others, seeing this scene, they all felt a sense of admiration. Su Yu, this guy, was always so arrogant wherever he went, and yet, he had the capital to be arrogant!

Even in the Upper Realm, this guy remained as arrogant as ever!

At this moment, those who came from the Lower Realm had mixed feelings. Indeed, in the Lower Realm, Su Yu was the boss, and here, he still was!
