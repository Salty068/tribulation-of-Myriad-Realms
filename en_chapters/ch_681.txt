Chapter 681: Old Wan is Still the Best (Please Subscribe)

Death Realm.

Su Yu sent the Guardians up and didn't bother with them further. As for the news of Minshan Hou's demise, he naturally had no way of knowing, and even if he did, Su Yu wouldn't care too much.

At most, he'd sigh a few times.

They weren't close!

As for dying… then so be it. It wasn't that he was heartless; he just found those fellows in the Upper Realm, to put it bluntly, too complicated. There were traitors, fools, disobedient ones, and those who relied on their seniority.

It was a mixed bag, and they might even drag him down!

It wasn't Su Yu's guess that this was the case; it was simply the truth. Especially with Hundred Battle King causing the human race's defeat, Su Yu didn't want to talk about the Upper Realm at all. If even a hundred Daofuse experts could be defeated and die in battle, what else could he hope for?

He might as well start anew!

Just don't cause me trouble, he had absolutely no expectation of the Upper Realm helping him in any way.

…

At this moment, Su Yu led his people into the East King's Residence.

Sure enough, in a grand hall, he discovered the Heaven-Covering Mirror. It was somewhat similar to the Sensing Mirror in the Great Ming King's Residence, but its grade was higher.

This item had only one purpose: to monitor the death spirits near the Celestial River of Death.

It even marked the number of Death Spirit Monarchs in the Spirit Suppressing Domain.

A very useful treasure!

“With this thing, why didn't you say so earlier?”

Su Yu looked at Hetu, who lightly coughed. “I forgot earlier.”

Su Yu was speechless. “This is a good item! It's used to monitor the revived death spirits in the Celestial River of Death. In ancient times, they were quite dedicated, paying considerable attention to the Death Realm. Any Eternal stage and above will be revealed!”

“In war, intelligence is the most important thing!”

Su Yu smiled and said, “As long as the intelligence is accurate and up-to-date, then defeating the strong with the weak, surprise attacks, and decapitation strikes can all achieve miraculous results!”

“Use this thing well to monitor the movements of the death spirits on the Celestial River of Death side!”

Su Yu said, a hint of solemnity in his voice, “Many Marquises died over there this time, and a large number of Monarchs as well. There are still some Death Spirit Marquises lurking within! A new batch will definitely revive soon. Also, North Heavenly King and the others fled to the Lawless Land, which is called the Land of Return to Ruin?”

Behind him, South Heavenly King entered the door and interjected, “The Land of Return to Ruin is very dangerous; a group of powerful experts should be sealed there! I've also heard that in the past, some death spirit experts were endless, just like now. In the end, Martial King and the others sealed a group of top-tier experts in the Land of Return to Ruin to prevent more powerful death spirits from being born from the Death Spirit Dao, leaving only the Four Heavenly Kings!”

Su Yu nodded. “So that's how it is! This makes it understandable why your strength, South Heavenly King, hasn't improved much over the years. That place is not to be provoked; once a few death spirit experts are unsealed, it would be a lot of trouble.”

“North Heavenly King led people there!”

South Heavenly King said gravely, “It's still very troublesome. If he has any ideas and unseals the sealed experts…”

“It's not that easy!”

Su Yu smiled. “If they really get unsealed, then there's nothing we can do but abandon the Death Realm! We'll temporarily take refuge in the Living Realm. As long as there's no slaughter and no large amount of death qi spills out, it won't be a big problem for now. Block the passage, and it won't be easy for those death spirits to break out!”

Speaking of this, Su Yu added, “Send some Monarchs to station at the edge of the Land of Return to Ruin, mainly for vigilance! And send another group to guard the Celestial River of Death.”

Then, Su Yu continued, “Also, the realm barrier between the Abyss Heaven Realm and the Death Realm is somewhat weak, allowing some weaker existences to pass through. Send people to station there, led by Death Spirit Marquises, and kill anyone who enters from that side!”

“Furthermore, patrol the entire Four King Domains to prevent the myriad races from secretly opening death spirit passages to enter the realm and bring back news of the Death Realm!”

Behind him, the Death Spirit Generals quickly took notes and arranged for people to carry out the tasks.

Su Yu then said, “As for me, I have a few things to do next: locate the experts of various realms and secretly assassinate them!”

He looked at South Heavenly King and Lanshan Hou, then quickly said, “We need to act quickly and keep the news sealed! South Heavenly King, Lanshan Hou, your strength won't be suppressed if you enter a Minor Living Realm, right?”

“No!”

Death spirits entering a realm would not be suppressed either. The Death Spirit Dao was too powerful; the opponent's Dao could not suppress the Death Spirit Dao.

Su Yu nodded. “That's good! It's best not to kill them, but to capture them alive. This is more difficult! If they're killed, the realm turbulence and phenomena across the Myriad Realms will make it hard to conceal!”

“Also, we need to seal off the movements of the Minor Living Realm to prevent the opponent from self-destructing. This will test everyone greatly; even a slight mistake could lead to discovery by the myriad races!”

With their current strength, they weren't incapable of defeating the myriad races!

The key was that forcing the myriad races into a desperate fight would still be very troublesome.

It would be best if they could resolve it silently.

The best outcome would be to annihilate the myriad races without the Upper Realm even knowing; that would be perfect!

Su Yu preferred to launch an offensive himself rather than being forced into a passive battle when the Upper Realm opened.

South Heavenly King pondered for a moment and said, “We will still experience some suppression in the Living Realm, and living beings have many methods. The suppression from the Death Spirit Dao isn't obvious, so even if the opponent is weaker than us, with your many requirements, it might not be as simple as you think.”

Su Yu nodded. “Then, South Heavenly King, what else do you think is needed?”

“Breaking open a realm will take some time, and that time is enough for a Daofuse expert to find a way to send a message or escape!”

South Heavenly King thought for a moment and said, “There's another point: we cultivate the Death Spirit Dao, which is not the same as the Time Dao. We can suppress their power and their Dao! However, it's difficult to seal off their Dao! We need a living being to seal it!”

Su Yu thought about it and nodded. That was true.

They weren't on the same Dao, so it was hard to seal.

Relying entirely on death spirits wouldn't work; at least one living expert was needed. He could do it himself, but it might not be successful, so it would be best to have another person help.

Thinking of this, Su Yu said, “Grand Dream General, then.”

“It's still best to be a human. Grand Dream General will be suppressed by the realm power!”

South Heavenly King suggested, but Su Yu had a headache. Great Zhou King was actually very suitable and could even block movements, but if Great Zhou King came here, who would seal the outside?

Great Ming King?

Could Great Ming King do it?

He always felt that the human race now was still lacking, not in experts, but in a cunning and versatile expert, someone who could handle a bit of everything.

Great Zhou King was actually very good.

“Principal Wan…”

Su Yu suddenly thought of Wan Tiansheng. This person, too, had all calculations within his heart… Although he was calculated against in the end, he still jumped out of that circle.

Over the years, not many could jump out of that circle.

Wan Tiansheng…

Su Yu still didn't know what Dao Old Wan walked, but he knew that Old Wan either found and established his own Dao or was preparing to fuse with another Dao.

To reach this point without seeing the Dao, Old Wan's achievements were still terrifying.

Lan Tian went without saying, but Lan Tian wasn't suitable for direct combat; he was good at lurking.

“Perhaps Old Wan has already established a Dao, or fused with one… and he's not weak. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to contend with a fifth or sixth-stage Eternal from the start. Finding Old Wan and taking him on a trip down the River of Time might allow him to comprehend even more!”

Su Yu thought that Wan Tiansheng was a prodigy, an absolute prodigy, even more so than Ye Batian, whom everyone always praised.

In Grand Dream City, Su Yu had once heard Heaven Gate General say that the most formidable wasn't Ye Batian; the most talented was Wan Tiansheng.

Young in age, strong in talent, after the failure of the Three Body Method, he no longer walked the path of the Three Body Method, but walked his own Dao, decisive in killing, killing so many Eternal descendants without hesitation.

He had been somewhat negligent before; he should have brought Old Wan back. It would be better than Old Wan figuring things out on his own.

If Old Wan were here, Su Yu would feel more at ease and wouldn't have to keep thinking about asking Great Zhou King for help.

Thinking these thoughts, Su Yu quickly said, “I will find a way to resolve these issues. In that case, I should still make a trip to the Living Realm to draw out those fellows and test the movements of the myriad races! And by the way, find a way to place the positioning items in various realms.”

After that, Su Yu said solemnly, “The Death Realm will still trouble you all! It seems we've taken down the Four King Domains and the Spirit Suppressing Domain, but I know the true situation. Beyond the Four King Domains, the Land of Return to Ruin is fraught with danger! The Celestial River of Death is even more troublesome!”

Su Yu took a deep breath. “Hetu, go find Xia Chen! Call Liu Wenyan out for me! Tell that fellow to come to the East King's Residence and keep an eye on the situation for me. That guy is cunning and treacherous, and now that he's fused with the Ink Dao, he has a knack for dealing with death spirits. Make him come out and work!”

After speaking, he took out another item, the Culture Tomb!

Yes, the Culture Tomb from which the '↑' character had been extracted. Su Yu said solemnly, “Use this to sense some newly revived death spirits, including some older death spirits! Note down all those with fluctuations!”

Hetu took the Culture Tomb and looked at Su Yu, somewhat puzzled.

“This was created by Culture King's students!”

South Heavenly King suddenly looked at Su Yu, who smiled and said, “Culture King did take some students back then, but unfortunately, they couldn't inherit the pen dao. Later, to create this item, they all fused their character combat techniques… What a pity! Some might not have been strong, but these people had a knack for character research and Dao analysis!”

Su Yu still praised them, calling them quite formidable.

In fact, it was equivalent to dissecting the Dao!

Su Yu didn't know how strong these students of Culture King were, but he knew that their method was similar to Bai Feng's dissection method!

These people had dissected Culture King's 99 character combat techniques for him!

Learning them bit by bit!

And at this moment, Su Yu thought of something: if the pen dao was so difficult, and these people could dissect it, then what about other Daos?

Could these people also dissect other Daos and allow people to comprehend them bit by bit through the form of characters?

If so, that would be amazing!

Su Yu felt that it was possible!

No other reason, if the pen dao could be dissected, there was no reason other Daos couldn't. These were a group of scholars, perhaps not skilled in combat, but they were all top-tier researchers.

Su Yu was even thinking of reviving them, helping them recall their past, and then helping him reassemble the myriad Daos in the future!

Yes, Su Yu had this intention.

There weren't many researchers left now.

Su Yu, on his side, didn't pay much attention to Bai Feng and the others now, not even involving them in strength enhancement. This was actually because he wanted them to focus solely on researching these things.

This world, after all, belonged to the intelligent.

Fools were not worthy of controlling the world.

He had to grasp both hands!

Without everyone's research, Su Yu wouldn't have reached this point today, nor would he have been able to open 720 acupoints and open the Heaven Gate.

Whether it was technique deduction, acupoint positioning, or combat technique dissection, they had all provided him with much help in the early stages.

At this moment, South Heavenly King didn't say anything, but Lanshan Hou thought of something and said, “Culture King's students… I do know some of them, those old pedants, right? So annoying! Some were even older than Culture King, but their strength was very weak! If they died, could they really turn into death spirits?”

Su Yu chuckled, *So annoying?*

You're a fool, so it's natural to find researchers annoying; they probably looked down on you.

Speaking of which, Heavendoom was said to have a good relationship with them. How did Heavendoom manage that?

He thought about these things and asked, “Were there many of Culture King's students?”

“Not many, about seventy or eighty people!”

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. “Seventy or eighty people, so few? I see thousands of character combat techniques in the Culture Tomb… So, with so few people, each person contributed at least dozens or hundreds of combat techniques!”

Culture King was an arrogant person, as Su Yu himself felt.

He should also have the ability to dissect combat techniques and let people learn them bit by bit, but he didn't. He only left a general outline, probably feeling that fools were not worthy of inheriting his Dao.

This kind of arrogance was something ordinary people couldn't comprehend.

Culture King himself knew that perhaps only a few could inherit his Dao.

When the phantom appeared in the pen dao last time, it said that by the time it appeared, the human race might have already been annihilated. Clearly, that fellow had no expectation that his Dao would be inherited in a short time, or by his cheap students.

However, this batch of his students did have some real ability, but unfortunately, their strength was probably not great.

After contributing so many combat techniques, they might have exhausted their energy analyzing the Dao, leaving no strength to cultivate, and all died.

Or perhaps they suffered a backlash from the pen dao!

Because they were deciphering this Dao!

Anyway, if they could be found and their memories restored, that would be best.

As Su Yu spoke of these people, he thought of another person and said, “Also, Ye Batian, look for him too. Hetu knows him, see if you can find him!”

Hetu smiled. “Ye Batian… Speaking of him, it's a pity. If this person hadn't died, he might have also reached Daofuse! It was also he who officially announced Culture King's legacy to the Myriad Realms…”

Ye Batian was difficult to evaluate.

But when he was dying, he should have discovered some mysteries of the Dao. Now, Su Yu, having seen through the Dao, understood Ye Batian a bit. Back then, when his characters fused, he might have indeed discovered the secrets of the Dao.

However, this secret was worthless now; Su Yu had opened the Heaven Gate.

Without Ye Batian, there would have been no Liu Wenyan lurking in Nanyuan City, no Su Yu joining the Multi-Character Department, no inheritance of the pen dao, and many other things. Today, the situation might have been completely different.

If he only had the Book of Time, Su Yu might still be lurking in the shadows, constantly absorbing blood essence to improve himself.

Then, in a few years, when the Upper Realm opened, it might have been another situation entirely, with the human race annihilated!

Su Yu didn't say much. “Find him if you can, if not, then so be it. He died not long ago, so he might not have revived yet! But with the recent turbulence in the Celestial River of Death, many who died recently might revive! I think he might be found,
