Chapter 681: Old Wan is Still the Best (Subscription Requested)

Death Realm.

Su Yu sent the guardians up and didn't concern himself further. As for the fall of Marquis Minshan, he naturally had no way of knowing. Even if he did, Su Yu wouldn't care much.

At most, he would sigh a few times.

After all, he wasn't familiar with him!

As for dying... well, let him die. It's not that Su Yu was heartless; he just felt that the people from the Upper Realm were too complicated. To put it bluntly, Su Yu thought they were a mixed bag of traitors, fools, disobedient ones, and those who relied on their seniority.

A motley crew that might even hold him back!

Su Yu wasn't just guessing; it was a fact. Especially since the Hundred Battle King led the Human Race to defeat, Su Yu didn't even want to mention the Upper Realm. Over a hundred Daofuse experts could be defeated and killed—what could he expect from them?

He might as well start anew!

Just don't cause trouble for me, he thought. He never expected the Upper Realm to be of any help.

...

At this moment, Su Yu, leading his people, entered the East King's Palace.

Sure enough, in a grand hall, he found the Heaven-Covering Mirror. It was somewhat similar to the sensing mirror of the Great Ming Prefecture, but of a higher grade.

This thing had one use: monitoring the undead near the Celestial River.

It even marked the number of undead monarchs in the Spirit Suppression Domain.

A very useful treasure!

"Why didn't you mention this earlier?" Su Yu looked at Hetu, who coughed lightly, "I forgot."

Su Yu was speechless, "This is a good thing! It's used to monitor the revival of undead in the Celestial River. In ancient times, they were quite diligent and paid considerable attention to the Death Realm. Anything above the Eternal stage will be revealed!"

"In warfare, intelligence is most important!"

Su Yu smiled, "As long as the intelligence is symmetrical and keeps up, then the weak can defeat the strong, ambushes, and decapitations can achieve miraculous effects!"

"This thing, use it well, and monitor the movements of the undead on the Celestial River side!"

Su Yu said, his expression slightly serious, "Many marquises died over there this time, and even more monarchs. Now, some undead marquises are still lurking among them! Surely, another batch will revive soon. Also, the North King and his people fled to the Land of the Abyss, is that what it's called?"

Behind him, the South King entered the room and spoke, "The Land of the Abyss is very dangerous and should have sealed a batch of powerful beings! I heard that in the past, some powerful undead were unkillable, just like now. Eventually, the Martial King and others sealed a batch of top-tier powerhouses in the Land of the Abyss, preventing the undead path from birthing more powerhouses, leaving only the Four Heavenly Kings!"

Su Yu nodded, "I see! That explains why your strength hasn't improved much over the years, South King. That place is not to be trifled with. If a few undead powerhouses are unsealed, it would be a huge problem."

"The North King fled there with his people!"

The South King said gravely, "It's still very troublesome. If he gets any ideas and unseals the sealed powerhouses..."

"It's not that easy!"

Su Yu laughed, "If they really unseal them, there's nothing we can do but abandon the Death Realm temporarily and retreat to the Living Realm. As long as we don't kill or let a lot of death energy spill out, there won't be a big problem for the time being. Block the passage, and those undead won't find it easy to break through!"

Saying this, Su Yu added, "Send some monarchs to station at the edge of the Land of the Abyss, mainly to keep watch! Also, send a batch of people to guard the Celestial River of Death."

Then, Su Yu continued, "Also, the barrier between the Abyssal Realm and the Death Realm is somewhat weak. Some weak beings can penetrate the barrier. Send people to station there, let the undead marquises lead, and kill anyone who enters from that side!"

"Additionally, patrol the entire Four Kings' Domains to prevent the myriad races from secretly opening undead passages and entering the realm to bring back news of the Death Realm!"

Behind him, the undead generals quickly noted down his orders and arranged for people to carry them out.

Su Yu continued, "Next, I have a few tasks to complete, locating the positions of strong individuals in various realms and secretly assassinating them!"

He looked at the South King and Marquis Lanshan, quickly saying, "We need to act swiftly and decisively, sealing off information! South King, Marquis Lanshan, when you enter the small realms of the living, your strength won't be suppressed, right?"

"No!"

Undead entering the realms aren't suppressed either; the undead path is too strong, and the opponent's path can't suppress the undead path.

Su Yu nodded, "That's good! It's best not to kill, but to capture alive, which is more challenging! If you kill them, the realm will be in turmoil, and the phenomena of the heavens will make it hard to conceal!"

"Also, we need to seal off the small realm's movements to prevent the opponent from self-destructing. This will test everyone greatly; any slip-up could easily alert the myriad races!"

The current strength isn't about being unable to defeat the myriad races!

The key is, if the myriad races are forced into a corner, it would be very troublesome.

If it can be resolved quietly, that would be best.

The best outcome would be to destroy the myriad races without the Upper Realm knowing—that would be perfect!

Su Yu preferred to attack the Upper Realm himself rather than passively defending when the Upper Realm opened!

The South King pondered for a moment and said, "In the Living Realm, we still face some suppression, and the living have many methods. The undead path's suppression isn't obvious. Even if the opponent is weaker than us, your requirements are too high, and it might not be that simple."

Su Yu nodded, "Then what do you think, South King, is needed?"

"Breaking into a realm requires some time, and during this time, it's enough for a Daofuse expert to find a way to send a message or escape!"

The South King thought for a moment and said, "Also, we cultivate the undead path, which isn't the same as the time path. We can suppress them in terms of power and path, but it's hard to seal their path! We need a living being to seal it!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded; that was indeed the case.

Relying solely on the undead won't work; at least one living powerhouse is needed. He could do it himself, but it might not be successful. It would be best to have someone else help.

Thinking of this, Su Yu said, "General Hongmeng, perhaps."

"It would be best if it were a human; Hongmeng would be suppressed by the realm's power!"

The South King suggested, but Su Yu was troubled. The Great Zhou King would be ideal, as he could also shield the movements, but if the Great Zhou King came here, who would seal the outside?

The Great Ming King?

Could the Great Ming King do it?

It always felt like the human race was lacking something, not in terms of strong individuals, but in terms of a more cunning, versatile powerhouse who could handle a bit of everything.

The Great Zhou King would actually be quite good.

"Chief Wan..."

Su Yu suddenly thought of Wan Tiansheng. This person, in fact, had everything calculated in his mind... although he was often outmaneuvered, he still managed to break out of the circle.

Over the years, not many have managed to break out of that circle.

Wan Tiansheng...

What path did Old Wan take? Su Yu still didn't know, but he knew Old Wan either found his own path or was preparing to merge with another.

To reach this point without seeing the Great Path, Old Wan's achievements were still quite terrifying.

As for Lantian, there's no need to mention him, but Lantian isn't suitable for hard battles; he's more suited for lurking.

"Perhaps Old Wan has already opened his path or merged with one... and he's not weak. Otherwise, he couldn't have matched an Eternal of the fifth or sixth stage from the start. Finding Old Wan and taking him on a journey through the River of Time might allow him to comprehend even more!"

Su Yu thought, Wan Tiansheng is a monster, an absolute monster, even more so than the often-praised Ye Batian.

In the ancient city, Su Yu had heard the Heaven Gate General say that the most formidable wasn't Ye Batian, but the most talented was Wan Tiansheng.

Young and gifted, after the failure of the Three Body Method, he no longer walked the path of the three bodies, choosing a single path, decisive in killing, and killed so many descendants of the Eternal without hesitation.

Previously, he had somewhat neglected this and should have sought out Old Wan, which would be better than him fumbling around alone.

If Old Wan were here, Su Yu would feel more at ease and wouldn't have to keep thinking about asking the Great Zhou King for help.

Thinking of these things, Su Yu quickly said, "I'll find a way to solve these. In that case, I should still make a trip to the Living Realm to draw those guys away and test the myriad races' movements! Meanwhile, I'll find a way to place positioning items in various realms."

After saying this, Su Yu said in a deep voice, "The Death Realm will still trouble everyone! It seems like we've taken the Four Kings' Domains and the Spirit Suppression Domain, but I know the situation. Beyond the Four Kings' Domains, the Land of the Abyss is fraught with danger! The Celestial River of Death is even more troublesome!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "Hetu, go find Xia Chen! Get Liu Hong out for me! Have that guy come to the East King Domain and keep an eye on the situation. That guy is cunning and treacherous, and now that he's merged with the Ink Path, he's got a knack for dealing with the undead. Get him out here to work!"

After finishing, he took out an item, the Culture Tomb!

Yes, the Culture Tomb from which the "↑" character had been extracted. Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Use this to sense some newly revived undead, including some older undead, and sense them all! Record any fluctuations!"

Hetu took the Culture Tomb and looked at Su Yu, somewhat puzzled.

"This was crafted by the students of the Culture King!"

The South King suddenly looked at Su Yu, who smiled, "Back then, the Culture King did take some students. It's just a pity that they couldn't pass on the pen dao. Later, to craft this item, they all merged their character combat skills... what a pity! Some might not have been strong, but these people had a knack for character research and Great Path analysis!"

Su Yu still praised them, quite impressive.

In fact, it's equivalent to splitting the Great Path!

Su Yu didn't know the strength of these students of the Culture King, but he knew that it was similar to Bai Feng's splitting method!

These people split the Culture King's 99 combat skill characters!

Learning bit by bit!

And at this moment, Su Yu thought of one thing: the pen dao is so difficult, yet these people split it. What about other Great Paths?

Could these people also split other Great Paths and allow people to comprehend them bit by bit through the form of characters?

If they could, that would be amazing!

Su Yu believed it was possible!

Su Yu pondered over the matter. If the pen dao could be revived, why couldn't other daos? These were scholars, perhaps not adept at combat, but they were top-tier researchers. Su Yu was considering reviving them, hoping they would recall the past and assist him in reconstructing the myriad daos in the future.

Yes, Su Yu had such thoughts.

There weren't many researchers left in the world now. Su Yu didn't bother much with Bai Feng and the others, not even involving them in his strength enhancement. In truth, he wanted them to focus entirely on research. In this world, it was ultimately the intelligent who prevailed. Fools were unworthy of mastering the world.

Both hands must be grasped!

Without everyone's research, Su Yu wouldn't have reached his current level, nor would he have been able to open 720 acupoints and the Heaven Gate. Whether it was the deduction of techniques, the positioning of acupoints, or the dissection of combat skills, they all provided him with significant help in the early stages.

At this moment, the South King remained silent, but Marquis Lanshan seemed to recall something and said, "The Culture King's students... I know a bit about them. Those old scholars, right? So annoying! Some are even older than the Culture King, yet their strength is weak! If they died, could they really become undead?"

Su Yu chuckled. Annoying? For a fool like you, encountering researchers, it's only natural to find them bothersome. Perhaps they didn't even think much of you. Speaking of which, it was said that Heavendoom got along well with them. How did he manage that?

He pondered these thoughts and asked, "Were there many students of the Culture King?"

"Not many, around seventy or eighty."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Seventy or eighty? That's so few? I saw in the Culture Tomb that there were probably thousands of divine character combat skills... So, with so few people, each must have contributed dozens or even hundreds of combat skills!"

The Culture King was an arrogant person, as Su Yu himself had sensed. He likely had the ability to dissect combat skills, allowing others to learn bit by bit, but he didn't. He only left a rough outline, probably thinking that fools were unworthy of inheriting his dao.

Such arrogance was something most people couldn't comprehend. The Culture King himself knew that few could inherit his dao. The last time the shadow of the pen dao appeared, it said that if it appeared, the Human Race might be extinct. Clearly, that guy never expected his dao to be inherited by anyone, let alone his students, in the short term.

However, his batch of students did have some skills, though their strength was probably not impressive. After contributing so many combat skills, they might have exhausted their energy in analyzing the dao, leaving no strength for cultivation, leading to their deaths. Or perhaps they were backlashed by the pen dao because they were deciphering this path!

In any case, finding them and restoring their memories would be ideal.

As Su Yu spoke of these people, he thought of someone else and said, "And Ye Batian, try to find him too. Hetu knows him, see if he can be found!"

Hetu laughed, "Ye Batian... It's a pity about him. If he hadn't died, he might have reached Daofuse! It was he who formally announced the Culture King's legacy to the Myriad Realms..."

Ye Batian was hard to evaluate. But at the time of his death, he must have discovered some secrets of the dao. Now that Su Yu had seen through the dao, he had some understanding of Ye Batian. Back then, when he fused divine characters, he might have discovered the secrets of the dao.

But now, that secret was worthless, as Su Yu had opened the Heaven Gate. Without Ye Batian, there would have been no Liu Wenyan lying low in Nanyuan, no Su Yu joining the Multi-divine Character Department, no inheritance of the pen dao, and many other things. Today, the situation might have been completely different.

If there was only the Book of Time, Su Yu might still be lurking in the shadows, absorbing blood essence day and night to enhance himself. In a few years, when the Upper Realm opened, it might have been another scenario, with the Human Race facing extinction!

Su Yu didn't say much more. "If you can find him, find him. If not, forget it. He hasn't been dead long, so he might not have revived yet! But with the recent turmoil in the Celestial River, some people who died recently might revive! I think he might be found, or if unlucky, he might have been killed before reviving, and there's nothing we can do about that!"

Hetu nodded, indicating he would look into it.

Su Yu arranged some matters and prepared to leave. The Death Realm was still somewhat oppressive.

...

He didn't stay long at the East King's Mansion. Moments later, Su Yu appeared in the Spirit Suppression Domain. After some thought, he flew towards an ancient castle.

In the Spirit Suppression Domain, there was only one ancient castle now. Or rather, in the entire Spirit Suppression Domain, apart from the Celestial River of Death, there were only a few undead and one undead monarch here.

...

"Great Commander!"

In the Star-Moon Kingdom, the commanders still remembered Su Yu. Or rather, they couldn't forget him. Just as they were about to greet him, the undead named Xing Da, whom Su Yu had named, quickly corrected himself, "Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

Clearly, these undead were aware of the situation. They knew who the boss of the Death Realm was now!

Su Yu smiled, nodding slightly. "Where is Lord Xingyue?"

"In the mansion!"

Su Yu waved his hand, signaling them to step back, and walked towards the dark castle. On both sides, there were some pitch-black trees, which were quite unsightly. However, that's just how the Death Realm was. Having these was already good enough; one shouldn't ask for too much.

Su Yu stepped inside. In the vast hall, Xingyue sat on the throne, looking at him coldly. She had long known of his arrival through their death aura connection. Coldly, she said, "What are you here for?"

"You're joking, my lord. I'm here to report to you that I've conquered the Death Realm, and from now on, it's yours, my lord."

Xingyue almost felt like collapsing. What do you mean, mine? Su Yu was still as nonsensical as ever!

"Hmph!"

Too lazy to deal with Su Yu, Su Yu chuckled, not minding, and found a place to sit. He looked at Xingyue and asked, "My lord, have you recalled any past events recently?"

"Too lazy to think about it!"

Xingyue didn't want to talk much with him. Su Yu laughed, "Don't be like that. I think Lord Xingyue has a noble status and might know some secrets! Or perhaps some treasures. Why don't I dig them up for you? Recently, manpower is short, and treasures are lacking. I'll fetch them for you."

Saying this, Su Yu looked expectant and asked, "My lord, do you remember if the Human Emperor left any treasures?"

"I don't remember!"

Xingyue coldly replied, "Is that why you came to me?"

"Not really, just asking in passing. Mainly, I came to visit you, my lord."

Su Yu smiled brightly, "I roughly understand the procedure for resurrection now! But I'm still missing a lot of things, like the paper dao. The pen, ink, and inkstone daos all have inheritances, but the paper dao hasn't been obtained yet! And even if I have them all, I might still need some other things..."

Su Yu talked for a while and then asked, "Lord Xingyue, do you have any impressions of these?"

If the Culture King really intended to resurrect Xingyue back then, did Xingyue have any memories from that time? She was an ancient existence, always staying here, entertaining herself with a castle, completely different from other undead. Her reclusiveness was terrifying!

She wasn't unable to leave; she could leave this place. Yet, she had stayed here for hundreds of thousands of years. You had to admire that.

In Xingyue's memory, did the Culture King exist?

Su Yu actually concluded that if the Culture King wanted to resurrect someone, and it wasn't the South King, then it must be Xingyue!

Xingyue frowned, looking at Su Yu. After a long while, she said, "Is resurrection really good? Is it meaningful? I see you living beings constantly fighting! Endless battles! What's so good about fighting? Shattering the heavens, leaving corpses across the Myriad Realms!"

Su Yu laughed, "It's unavoidable, but living beings do have their benefits, many benefits."

Xingyue sneered. Benefits? She didn't think so!

Su Yu also laughed. Suddenly, with a wave of his hand, a scene of blooming flowers appeared before them. Xingyue was slightly taken aback, looking at the scene. Su Yu smiled, "My lord, this is the benefit of living beings. Look, how beautiful are the flowers? They're not comparable to the black flowers of the Death Realm!"

"Nor is it the endless darkness. Dusk looks too dull!"

Xingyue looked at the flowers, slightly lost in thought for a moment. After a long time, she asked, "Where is this?"

"The Culture King's Residence."

"I seem to have seen it before."

Su Yu's eyes moved. Indeed! The Culture King's Residence wasn't a place just anyone could go to. The Culture King's lair was accessible to only a few people.

Xingyue looked for a while, then after a long time, she said, "There was a courtyard there, and I think there was a tree in the courtyard, right?"

Su Yu nodded!

Xingyue thought for a moment, then shook her head, "I can't remember! Some things have long been forgotten! The Culture King... Maybe I really did meet him, the Time Sage..."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. Could she be the Time Sage? The Time Sage was in battle!

Xingyue seemed a bit dazed. The name Time Sage was something Xingyue had mentioned before. Before that, even Grandstar and the others didn't know about the Time Sage's existence.

However, Xingyue seemed to recall something again, rubbing her forehead, she said, "I seem to vaguely remember something. I should... might know the Time Sage! The Culture King and the Time Sage disappeared, and the Human Emperor disappeared too. All of this... might be related to the Time Sage. She seemed to have discovered some secret..."

Xingyue had a headache, shaking her head, "It might be related to the Time Dao... probably? The Time Sage... she was very powerful and loved to wander around. The Myriad Realms... maybe she knew more secrets than anyone else... Knowing too much might have led to her disappearance..."

In bits and pieces, Xingyue said some things, finally having a splitting headache, "Enough of this, I can't remember! Next time you come..."

She looked at Su Yu, her face cold, "Next time you come, pick some of these flowers and offer them to me!"

Su Yu grinned, a bit helpless, "This... is a bit difficult. A dog guards them closely. Fat Ball, do you know it?"

"Don't know!"

Xingyue snorted, "It might be planted by the Time Sage. She and I should know each other. If I want a flower from her, a dog can't stop me!"

"Fat Ball might not believe it!"

Xingyue frowned at him, "Incompetent! Can't even handle a small matter!"

As the conversation concluded, Su Yu pondered for a moment before speaking again, "The Time Sage's dog, you say? I don't recall it, perhaps because I've never seen it... However, I vaguely remember something. The garden you showed me, I think I've been there before! I might have left something behind..."

Su Yu's eyes widened in surprise. What could it be? A treasure, perhaps?

Xingyue had indeed visited the place and seemed to have left something there. This was worth investigating. Xingyue sneered, "Don't get your hopes up. It's not a treasure. I can't remember exactly what it is, but it shouldn't be anything valuable! It should be buried in the backyard, under three blue flowers if my memory serves me right. It might have decayed by now, considering how many years have passed."

Su Yu noted this down, not too concerned about whether there were blue flowers or not. He would find out once he checked.

What could be buried there? Why would you bury something at the Culture King's Residence?

Who exactly is Xingyue?

Su Yu was indeed curious, but Xingyue's fragmented memories, possibly due to her unrecovered strength, left much unknown.

Seeing Su Yu still lingering, Xingyue felt a bit exasperated. Sitting there in silence with Su Yu was dull and boring, so she added, "You can leave now. Also, I don't remember anything about treasures! I vaguely recall that the Time Sage had a book, which might contain some secrets. That book is in your possession, isn't it?"

Su Yu was taken aback. Had he mentioned it before? How did she know?

Secrets in the book?

The Book of Time was something Su Yu could now somewhat utilize, though he couldn't fully control it yet. Xingyue's words piqued his interest, prompting him to consider exploring it further. After all, this was the foundation of his rise.

"Alright, thank you for the tip, my lady!"

Su Yu stood up, smiling, "I'll head out to continue conquering the world for you. If you remember anything good, be sure to call me."

"Hmph!"

Xingyue snorted, "Do you take me for a fool? Conquering the world for me, who are you trying to fool!"

Su Yu chuckled and gracefully left.

After he departed, Xingyue also snorted, seemingly in a good mood, and continued to tinker with her ancient castle. This castle had been crafted over countless years. She used to like it, but now she suddenly felt it lacked a bit of color. Perhaps, being alive was indeed more exciting.

...

At this moment, Su Yu exited through the original passage of the Grandstar Ancient City. Of course, it was now under someone else's control, with Zhou Potian stationed there.

As soon as Su Yu emerged, Zhou Potian tensed up but quickly relaxed, hastily saying, "Emperor Yu, my father instructed me to inform you immediately to visit the Human Realm! Recently, something seems off, and some news from the Upper Realm has come through. It seems the human side has suffered heavy losses!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. News from the Upper Realm? Heavy losses? Well, let it be.

Seeing Su Yu's calm demeanor, Zhou Potian grew anxious, "Emperor Yu, if the Upper Realm's defenses fail, and the Upper Realm opens, we'll be in big trouble!"

Su Yu glanced at him, "Why are you so anxious? Learn from your father; he knows how to stay calm..."

"He's anxious too!"

Zhou Potian replied helplessly, "My father is also very worried because the news this time is quite unfavorable. It's said that a pillar of our human race in the Upper Realm has fallen."

"After all these years, and now someone falls?"

Su Yu pondered, shaking his head, "If it's not the work of a traitor, then there's an insider! I'm not too familiar with the situation in the Upper Realm, but I did inquire a bit last time. It's said that not many are left alive, hiding in some secret and desperate places. They've managed to stay hidden all these years, and now they're dead? As expected, the traitors in the Upper Realm can't sit still anymore."

Zhou Potian didn't understand why Su Yu was so certain, but he didn't question it. He himself wasn't clear on the situation, not even knowing who Marquis Minshan was. It was just that his father had sent an urgent message, seemingly eager for Su Yu to return.

Su Yu truly wasn't in a hurry. He asked, "Have you seen Principal Wan recently?"

"No."

"Alright, if you see him, let him know for me..."

At this point, Su Yu decided against it. He flew out of the ancient city, loudly proclaiming, "Principal Wan, if you hear this, return to the Human Realm to discuss the matter of launching a strong attack on the Myriad Realms!"

His voice echoed across the heavens!

Su Yu remained as arrogant as ever!

He was eager for someone to come and ambush him. The Grand Dream City would arrive in an instant, and with so many Daofuse experts there, if those bastards dared to show up, Su Yu would be relieved!

...

As Su Yu's words spread, projections appeared in various great realms.

In the Fate Realm.

Marquis Modang sneered, "What an arrogant fellow. Is this the Human Lord of this generation? Even the Hundred Battle King of the previous generation wasn't this arrogant! Treating the Allheaven Battlefield as his own territory?"

Marquis Falling Star chuckled, "Arrogant as he may be, his talent is undeniable. It's said he inherited the pen dao of the Culture King!"

Marquis Modang frowned slightly, "That talent is indeed formidable. The Culture King... his dao can only be inherited by true prodigies!"

Though cold, he didn't deny Su Yu's talent.

The Culture King's dao wasn't something just anyone could inherit.

It required an extraordinary genius!

Marquis Modang coldly stated, "No wonder Tiangu wants us to descend to the lower realm. This guy is indeed a threat! We should seize the opportunity to eliminate him and remove future troubles!"

"That's not advisable."

Marquis Falling Star shook his head, "This person is so arrogant, he might have some hidden cards. Killing him now, with all eyes on the Myriad Realms, would be difficult. A forced kill would result in a deadly battle! Let's wait a bit longer, until the various races further weaken the power of the passages, allowing more Dao brothers to descend!"

As they conversed, not far away, the Fate Emperor was preparing to leave. Marquis Falling Star smiled, "Wuming, why the rush? Come, sit and chat with us."

The Fate Emperor glanced at them, feeling watched.

Troublesome!

He smiled, "Just going back to make some arrangements. Su Yu can't sit still. If he remains silent, it's fine, but when he speaks, there might be changes. He knows the Upper Realm's entrance is here, so it's better to be cautious and strengthen our defenses to prevent a surprise attack!"

Marquis Abyss sneered, "He wouldn't dare!"

The Fate Emperor smiled, "Why not? The Abyssal Race was wiped out just like that. Lingyuan probably thought he wouldn't dare, but... he really did!"

He jabbed at Marquis Abyss.

Why wouldn't he dare?

You guys just descended and think Su Yu is a coward?

The Fate Emperor was genuinely worried, not just making excuses. He truly feared Su Yu might lead an assault on the Fate Realm!

This was, after all, the entrance to the Upper Realm!

Marquis Abyss was furious, but Marquis Falling Star pondered and nodded, "Alright, Wuming, go ahead. Just don't leave the realm, to avoid being targeted by the humans!"

"Of course!"

The Fate Emperor said no more. Being targeted was one thing, but they were more worried about what he might do.

The Fate Emperor understood this clearly.

Soon, he departed.

After he left, Marquis Modang coldly remarked, "This tide, does the Fate Race still want to remain neutral? They think too highly of themselves! If the Fate Race continues like this, once the humans are gone, there won't be any neutral factions left!"

Neutrality was only possible when the humans and myriad races were evenly matched. Once the battle concluded, and no victor emerged, everyone worried about which side the neutral races would lean towards.

The Fate Race was quite formidable, especially with a top-tier Daofuse expert in the Upper Realm.

But if this tide continued, and the Fate Race remained neutral, once a victor emerged, retribution would be swift.

...

Meanwhile.

Su Yu's voice also reached the East Rift Valley.

The Great Zhou King, who had been troubled recently, felt somewhat reassured upon hearing Su Yu's voice. Despite Su Yu's arrogance, his record of victories against the myriad races, forcing them into hiding, provided a sense of security.

"He's finally back. I wonder what the situation is now?"

The Great Zhou King pondered, sighing again. Recently, Old Qin and the others hadn't been communicating much.

Those fellows, ever since they went to Grand Dream City, hadn't been managing human affairs much.

Aren't they worried about the humans being wiped out?

Or do they trust Su Yu too much?

Do they believe that as long as Su Yu is around, everything will be fine?

As he thought about these things, he also speculated on why Su Yu was looking for Wan Tiansheng. Lantian had returned to the Human Realm, and Wan Tiansheng seemed to have disappeared recently. The Great Zhou King didn't pay much attention, as Wan Tiansheng, despite his talent, only had mid-tier Eternal combat strength.

In the upcoming battles, he wouldn't play a decisive role.

As he continued to ponder, his eyes flickered, and moments later, the void split open.

Su Yu descended from the cracked void with his hands behind his back. Just as the Great Zhou King was about to speak, Su Yu said, "Don't tell me who died or what happened. I don't want to hear it! The news from the Upper Realm is definitely being spread by the myriad races to stir things up. Why spread it so widely? To unsettle people! You're not stupid, so why show such worry?"

The Great Zhou King was slightly shaken, quickly responding, "Even if I don't say it, the myriad races will soon reveal the importance of Marquis Minshan. Hearing it from outsiders, with embellishments, would be even more unsettling! It's better if I say it myself, so at least everyone is prepared."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "No need to worry."

"If I don't show concern, the myriad races might suspect we have some hidden cards or plans."

Su Yu nodded again, "True! Let's leave it at that."

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly but still spoke, "I'm still worried that something really went wrong in the Upper Realm! The humans should still have some Daofuse experts alive, maybe five or six, possibly even seven or eight! Regardless, it's a considerable force. At this critical moment, I know Emperor Yu might not care, but if they truly fall in battle, it wouldn't be worth it!"

"What can I do?"

Su Yu replied coldly, "Should I lead an assault up there now?"

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath, "That's not what I mean. I just wonder if we should create more disturbances in the Myriad Realms to draw the Upper Realm's attention. If we kill ten Eternals from a race, the rules of the Upper Realm will be disrupted, which could alleviate some pressure on the humans there."

"We'll see!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, "We'll follow my plan! I understand your intentions; you want to attack some realms and kill a few Eternals. If that's what you desire, take your people and do it yourself!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Emperor Yu, I'm doing this for the Human Race, not out of personal interest."

"I know!" Su Yu nodded, smiling. "I know you're doing it for the Human Race, but... you're not doing it for me! If you act rashly, the pressure on the Upper Realm will lessen. What about me?"

Su Yu sneered, "You old relics are always like this, not considering the practicalities! I thought you were smart, but when it comes to these matters, you're still the same. In your eyes, the Human Race comes first, and among them, the old relics of the Upper Realm weigh more heavily!"

"But you must understand, if you ruin my plan and cause the Myriad Races War to break out prematurely, resulting in the death of three to five Daofuse cultivators on my side... can you bear that responsibility?"

"You want me to trade three to five of my Daofuse cultivators for the survival of those people in the Upper Realm?"

Su Yu said coldly, "In your eyes, that's a fair trade! In my eyes, my Daofuse cultivators are my people, my loyal followers! Trading three to five of my Daofuse cultivators for seven or eight from the Upper Realm, you think it's worth it, I don't! Great Zhou King! Think carefully before you act. The Human Race won't collapse without you!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, nodding after a long pause, "I understand! Rest assured, Emperor Yu, I won't act recklessly!"

"That's for the best!"

Su Yu said calmly, "I know you're a smart person, always have been, but your constant interference is troubling! This time, with the changes in the Upper Realm, your first thought was to aid them, even before perfecting my plan, you wanted to attack the Myriad Realms prematurely. I hope there won't be a second time!"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "I understand! It's just... I hope to help those people as much as I can."

"If I can help, I naturally will!"

Su Yu glanced at the sky, "Let's wait for Principal Wan to arrive before discussing this further! First, let's find a way to lure out the Myriad Races' Daofuse cultivators and engage in a small-scale war!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, hesitating before finally speaking, "What about the Death Realm?"

"It's manageable! I've killed another Heavenly King; there are indeed many Heavenly Kings!"

Su Yu shook his head, "Killed the East King, the West King, Cangshan Ming, drove away the North King, exterminated dozens of Death Spirit Marquises, and killed hundreds of Monarchs, yet they seem endless! This wretched place is truly troublesome!"

The Great Zhou King was momentarily speechless, unsure whether to believe it or not. Forget it, I'll find out sooner or later!

At that moment, Su Yu smiled, sensing the presence of Old Wan. Old Wan had arrived, and compared to him, the Great Zhou King was far less considerate. Principal Wan was still the best.

This time, I'll spare no expense to push Old Wan to the Daofuse level!

In the future, he'll be the one to restrain the Great Zhou King for me!

Otherwise, among my subordinates, there's no one who can restrain this cunning king!

The Great Zhou King is useful, but he needs someone to keep him in check. The Great Qin King and the others are all brutes; they can't understand what the Great Zhou King is plotting.

Only Old Wan, once his strength reaches the necessary level, might be able to suppress the Great Zhou King.

Even if he can't, it won't be easy for the Great Zhou King to ruin my plans.

This man has indeed submitted, but his heart is with the Human Race, not with Su Yu. There's a difference between the two. The Torchbearer, the one who carries the flame of the Human Race, is not Su Yu's.
