Chapter 857: Living in Memories (10,000 Words for Subscription)

Half a day later.

Upper Realm.

Within Su Yu's world.

King Yue strode forward with a commanding presence, his head held high, his expression cold. Clad in armor, he saw Su Yu and clasped his hands in salute, speaking in a deep voice, "Yue Chuan, thanks the Emperor Yu for the rescue!"

After the salute, he raised his head, still defiant, "May I ask the Emperor Yu, when will we head upstream to battle?"

"…"

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "King Yue, shouldn't you rest for a while?"

King Yue's tone was indifferent, "The myriad races are not at peace, how can I rest? In the past, the Human Emperor defeated the myriad races beyond the River of Time. Over the years, I, Yue, have not fought. Now that I have revived, I must battle strong enemies again and display my divine might!"

Su Yu chuckled, observing him. King Yue's expression remained unchanged, but he seemed slightly uneasy. He looked at Su Yu, finding him somewhat similar to the Culture King, yet unfamiliar compared to the Culture King.

According to Marquis Huoyun, Su Yu was domineering, petty, ruthless, and vicious. Of course, he had many merits as well. Undoubtedly, this young man before him, with white hair and robes, appeared peaceful and kind, but in reality, he was one of the rare ruthless figures across the Myriad Realms.

Marquis Huoyun described Su Yu as having a heavy killing intent, even more so than King Yue himself. The key was that a scholar's killings were insidious. It seemed he had no illustrious battle achievements, yet he had killed his way from the Myriad Realms to the upper reaches of the River of Time. It was said that he had recently slain dozens of rulers of laws from the myriad races!

Such a ruthless person, King Yue had never heard of!

Indeed, never!

The Culture King was ruthless, but he did not kill as much. In the past, he subdued the myriad races, killing several rulers of laws—not just one or two, but quite a few. However, compared to Su Yu, who killed dozens at once… that was unheard of!

If he killed like that, the myriad races would have rebelled long ago. How could they have waited until later stages?

During the Human Emperor's unification of the heavens, the number of rulers of laws killed might not even match Su Yu's. Su Yu not only killed before but also during the Hundred Battle incident, and a batch of ancient beasts emerging from the Gate of Hell were also slain.

In total, Su Yu had killed over 40 rulers of laws!

During the conquest of the heavens, King Yue couldn't remember how many were killed, but the combined deaths of rulers of laws on both sides wouldn't exceed 40.

Facing such a ruthless person as Su Yu, even though he was incredibly young, King Yue dared not underestimate him in the slightest.

And Su Yu, on the other hand, looked at King Yue, smiling. He quite admired King Yue.

In life, he fought; in death, he remembered his mission, swallowing the Dao into his belly just for that one strike. Such a person was worthy of admiration.

"King Yue, do you still have first-class strength outside of this world?"

King Yue replied in a deep voice, "No, but I can barely maintain peak second-class strength!"

Su Yu sighed softly, speaking gently, "You are like this, and so is the Book Spirit. Outside of this world, neither can maintain first-class strength… It was within my expectations, but it's still somewhat disappointing!"

However, he quickly smiled again, "But within this world, you can barely reach first-class strength, right?"

"Yes!"

King Yue nodded, and Su Yu also nodded with a smile, "That's not bad!"

This indicated that the Culture King was indeed formidable. His world could support first-class experts.

At this point, Su Yu couldn't achieve that.

Su Yu fell into contemplation, and King Yue slightly frowned, "Does the Emperor Yu have plans? If so, I will go ahead…"

"What's the rush!"

Su Yu scolded, "Calm down!"

He frowned, "If you're a warrior, then follow orders! If not, wait for me to finish speaking! Being hasty and impatient, we already have enough warriors like the Martial King and Martial Emperor. If everyone becomes like them, who will manage everything?"

"…"

King Yue was momentarily speechless. I… I didn't even say anything.

Indeed, as Huoyun said, this Su Yu was extremely domineering, intolerant of any dissent, and gave face to no one because, in the heavens, his face was the biggest.

What an arrogant person!

King Yue was also a defiant person, but the more defiant he was, the more he couldn't forget Su Yu's life-saving grace. At this moment, despite his frustration, he could only remain silent, waiting for Su Yu to continue speaking.

He was anxious, but since Su Yu wasn't in a hurry, he could only wait!

Su Yu, unhurried, spoke softly, "You are second-class, the Book Spirit is second-class, and the Great Zhou King is second-class… Book Spirit, can the power of the Culture King's world be drawn over?"

The Book Spirit shook his head, then nodded, "I can't, but the master can! Isn't the master somewhat connected with His Majesty in the Heaven Gate? If needed, it can be done through the master, through the Heaven Gate, using His Majesty as a critical point to transmit the power of the world!"

Su Yu nodded but quickly shook his head, "It's best not to. The situation with the Culture King is unclear. If he frequently uses the power of the world, it might easily reveal problems and expose my existence… For now, I still don't want to be discovered by those so-called supreme beings!"

Even if they descended with a first-class avatar, Su Yu wasn't afraid. However, without reason, it was best not to provoke such beings now. If such beings appeared, Su Yu would have to give up some communication with the Culture King, and the Culture King wouldn't be able to borrow the power of the world.

This could be used in an emergency.

They were all second-class!

Su Yu sighed. The number of rulers of laws among the myriad races might not be as many as the human race, but they had more first-class experts.

On the side of the myriad races, there were as many as seven first-class experts!

On Su Yu's side, there were only the Radiant King, the Radiant King's Consort, the Suppressing Martial King, and Su Yu himself, lacking three.

Lacking three would easily lead to changes, even if he had more people.

If the Book Spirit and King Yue could both unleash first-class combat power, and if the Human Emperor could recover… then it would be balanced. As long as it was balanced in terms of first-class strength, Su Yu dared to initiate a great war. Otherwise, there would definitely be losses!

Heavy losses were not the result Su Yu wanted.

Su Yu tapped the table, falling into deep thought.

Gui!

Yes, at this moment, he once again set his sights on Gui.

This was a first-class expert!

The key was, it was hard to control!

If Gui could be obedient, and even call on friends to bring some strong experts, kill a batch, intimidate a batch, and recruit them for his use, that would be perfect.

Alternatively, if Gui couldn't come, it would be fine to send some cannon fodder over, let me kill them, and then I could fill my world?

Once I became strong myself, why would I care how many first-class experts the other side had?

One thought after another flashed through his mind.

Of course, the Book Spirit and King Yue could also be used as first-class combatants at critical moments.

"Your Majesty?"

While Su Yu was deep in thought, the Great Zhou King called out softly, "Your Majesty, King Yue has something to say."

Seeing King Yue speak and Su Yu not responding, he knew Su Yu was lost in thought and quickly interrupted, lest King Yue feel uncomfortable and harbor unnecessary resentment.

Su Yu looked up at King Yue, who spoke in a deep voice, "Emperor Yu, is it because our combat power is inferior to the enemy's that you hesitate… I… although I can only maintain second-class combat power, I can hold off a first-class opponent. If they dare to fight desperately, I can swallow the Dao and kill them. I have experience, and at worst, it's a life for a life!"

"…"

Su Yu frowned, suddenly angry, "Shut up! I integrated you into the Culture King's world, expended resources to resurrect you, just so you could exchange lives?"

Su Yu was somewhat annoyed, "Can't anyone be a little more sensible? If it were just about exchanging lives, I would have won long ago! Not just me, if the Culture King and Human Emperor had been willing, they could have defeated the myriad races early on! But after defeating the myriad races, who would deal with the beings in the Three Gates? A few warriors are enough, more are just annoying, don't you know?"

King Yue was momentarily speechless, unable to say a word.

Su Yu snorted, irritated, "In the future, set a rule that the number of warriors must not exceed a certain amount. Those who exceed it will be sent to the Human Emperor's world for brainwashing… ahem, for education!"

"…"

Everyone was speechless. What are you saying!

King Yue, having been rebuked several times, was somewhat frustrated, "Then… what opportunity are we waiting for?"

He was very anxious, genuinely anxious!

On one hand, he wanted to join the battle; on the other, he wanted to see old friends.

Su Yu said calmly, "What's the rush? No rush! Besides, if I don't go, the battle won't start over there!"

It's that simple!

If I don't go, the Human Emperor won't dare to act rashly.

And the myriad races won't dare to act recklessly.

So, this war can only resume if Su Yu goes.

If you're eager to go, it's just a fate of chatting and idling.

Su Yu stroked his chin, thinking, "The best outcome is for the Human Emperor to sever the Dao and integrate into the world. During this period, the myriad races don't start a war. When the Human Emperor returns, the other side starts the war… Of course, this is the ideal state, but the myriad races aren't foolish… they might not just watch!"

"The second ideal outcome is for the Human Emperor to integrate into the world, quickly become first-class, then return to participate in the battle. This way, he can have first-class combat power and intimidate the myriad races!"

The third option is to bring Gui over!

But Gui might not be obedient!

Also, does the Battle King have a chance to enter first-class?

As for Su Yu himself, there's no hope. Those who integrate into his Dao will have to wait for him to improve before considering others. Otherwise, first-class is extremely difficult, unless there's some special opportunity to break some limitations!

Wanting to win with minimal losses… troublesome!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King also understood Su Yu's dilemma. After pondering for a moment, he spoke, "Your Majesty, should I give it a try?"

"You?"

Su Yu was puzzled, "Can you break through to first-class? If you break through all the Daos in the River of Time, there's indeed some hope… but those Daos are either occupied or you don't have enough control, it might be difficult!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, quickly saying, "Your Majesty, what I mean is, if His Majesty the Human Emperor returns… it's best to bring back those weaker rulers of laws, those with Daos similar to mine! Integrate into the world, sever the Dao, and this way, the Daos are vacated, giving me hope to enter first-class! If I step into first-class, then losing some fourth-class or third-class rulers of laws is actually acceptable!"

Su Yu immediately understood his meaning!

The Great Zhou King still mastered fifteen or sixteen Daos. This guy was still quite formidable. On Su Yu's side, he had only severed the strongest ten Daos, but not all of them.

Some paths were occupied, preventing him from breaking through. Even if he severed his path and entered Su Yu's world, he couldn't reach the first tier. It was better to keep things as they were!

Now, he wanted the Human Emperor to take these rulers of laws back to sever their paths, giving him hope for a temporary breakthrough to cross into the first tier and break the shackles of Su Yu's world! This was a tactic others couldn't play!

No one else had so many paths of power at their disposal. The Great Zhou King had lived too long, and as the leader of the Human Emperor's secret guards, he had the ability, talent, resources, and techniques to achieve today's accomplishment of mastering dozens of paths.

Su Yu pondered for a moment and asked, "Are there any conflicts when you simultaneously wield my path and the path of the River of Time?"

"There are some," the Great Zhou King replied. "But the River of Time doesn't have much repulsion. If it were the Death Realm, it wouldn't be possible. However, the River of Time isn't sensitive to these things... or rather, it's so powerful that it doesn't care if we wield dual paths simultaneously!"

Su Yu nodded. That made sense; the River of Time was indeed special. This could be a solution!

However, he glanced at the Great Zhou King with a half-smile and said, "You seem to have it all planned out, hoping the Human Emperor will quickly take those rulers of laws who share your path away to sever their paths, never integrating these paths into my world... Have you been waiting for this?"

The Great Zhou King was extremely embarrassed. "That's not the case."

Su Yu sneered but soon chuckled, "But... it makes sense! Indeed, those occupying the paths are slow to advance. It might be better to sever their paths and integrate them into the Human Emperor's world! Yes, I should think of a way to see if I can get some people to relinquish their paths, allowing the Great Xia King and others to attempt a breakthrough..."

For instance, the Blade Path, currently occupied by the Blade King—perhaps it should be relinquished? Let the Great Xia King continue on the path of the River of Time and see if there's hope for a breakthrough.

Despite saying this, Su Yu was still troubled. It's not enough! Annoying!

If the Great Zhou King, Book Spirit, and King Yue could temporarily become first-tier, they could contend with the Dragon Emperor, Phoenix Emperor, and Spirit Emperor. As for the Nether Emperor, the Battle King could handle him; that guy was injured and wouldn't recover easily.

As for himself, along with the Radiant King and others, they might gain some advantage against the Three Emperors.

Various thoughts surfaced in his mind. Initially, they could focus on defense, waiting for the Human Emperor to break through and return, then find a way to deal with the Myriad Races! That could work!

They needed to act quickly! If they delayed any longer, Su Yu feared that everyone would drift downstream, getting dangerously close to the Myriad Realms, allowing the Three Gates to open!

As for the return here, it could wait. The efficiency was too slow! His friends hadn't arrived yet; these old relics were just dawdling!

Currently, there were no opportunities left in the Myriad Realms. Even if there were, they were the kind Su Yu hadn't discovered, and he couldn't quickly enhance himself in a short time!

Thinking of this, Su Yu said, "Great Zhou King, King Yue, Book Spirit, come with me to the front lines. Tongtian, you too! Empyrean Cloud, Fire Cloud, Lantian, and Tea Plant will stay behind!"

Four strong individuals staying behind... well, there's also the Heaven Monitoring Marquis, whom Su Yu didn't mention. Five will stay!

With this, their strength should be sufficient. The crack in the Gate of Hell would still be difficult to exit, and it probably couldn't support second-tier experts coming and going. Five strong individuals, including the Heaven Monitoring Marquis, who is also second-tier, should be enough!

Adding Empyrean Cloud and Fire Cloud, it should be about right.

Empyrean Cloud and Fire Cloud Marquis felt a bit uneasy. Empyrean Cloud was somewhat unwilling and said, "I want to go too!"

She looked at Su Yu, suggesting he take her along. She was more reliable than Heavendoom!

Su Yu smiled and said, "Senior Empyrean Cloud, staying behind in the Myriad Realms is the real heavy responsibility. The front lines will surely win, so there's no need to worry about that. The key is the rear base... Moreover, I have an extremely important task for you!"

"What is it?"

Su Yu said solemnly, "When the Human Emperor returns, you must keep an eye on him and not let him encroach on my world's territory. This is very important! Tea Plant doesn't understand, Fire Cloud is an old subordinate of the Imperial Court, and Lantian has other tasks... So, only you can keep watch!"

Empyrean Cloud was surprised. "Would the Human Emperor really encroach on your territory?"

Su Yu nodded. "It's possible. So, when the time comes, Senior Empyrean Cloud must step in to stop him! This is a big deal; we can't lose our home base."

Empyrean Cloud hesitated, "But I... can't stop the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu laughed, "No worries, you're a woman. Just cry, make a scene, and threaten to hang yourself. The Human Emperor won't be able to handle it."

"......"

The Great Zhou King, standing nearby, almost wanted to cry. You always do these ridiculous things!

Su Yu didn't care and said with a smile, "That's settled then. For now, there are probably no opportunities for me to improve in the Myriad Realms. As for other matters, I'll deal with them when I get there!"

The flow of time here might differ from the Myriad Realms. Su Yu noticed that the other side's efficiency was very slow. As for finding the Culture King, it was relatively quick, but coming and going was just a moment's work. According to Gui, he was working tirelessly, but Su Yu had actually waited for quite a while in the Myriad Realms.

So, calling friends might take a bit more time. At least wait for Gui to gather his teammates before Su Yu takes action. Otherwise, with just Gui, Su Yu wouldn't be satisfied.

Previously, Su Yu had only returned with Tongtian. Now, he brought three more: the Great Zhou King, King Yue, and Book Spirit.

Su Yu stood up and said, "Since King Yue is in a hurry, let's go! Also, you three... are all on my side now!"

Su Yu looked at King Yue and said, "You're now resurrected by me, owing me a life. Pay it back first, then we'll talk. The same goes for the Great Zhou King! This way, on the front lines, I have 39 people. No, including Xingyue, it's 40!"

Su Yu smiled brightly, "Looking at it this way, my people are quickly catching up to the Human Emperor's numbers!"

The Human Emperor's side had lost a few in battle before, leaving 48. The Myriad Races had four defectors, making it 52. Perhaps in the days Su Yu was away, a few Heavenly Venerables broke through due to previous battles, but at most, it was one or two.

Su Yu realized that the number of rulers of laws on the Human Emperor's side was almost equal to his own!

And he still had five strong individuals staying behind!

In the blink of an eye, he was almost catching up to the Human Emperor's accumulation of hundreds of thousands of years.

Su Yu's mood improved instantly!

The Great Zhou King actually thought Su Yu was quite childish! Sometimes, Su Yu didn't care about big things but enjoyed these small victories. Did having one more or one less really matter?

He was a bit speechless, while King Yue said solemnly, "I owe you a life, and I will repay it, but if you think I'll do anything against the Human Emperor, you're dreaming!"

"......"

Su Yu glanced at him, chuckled, and couldn't be bothered to respond.

The Great Zhou King also smiled and transmitted, "King Yue, don't take it seriously. Emperor Yu likes to joke around. He and the Human Emperor are still very close."

Is that so?

King Yue didn't say anything more but looked at the Great Zhou King and suddenly asked, "You used to be the Human Emperor's scribe. Why did you betray him?"

"......"

What kind of question is that?

The Great Zhou King was speechless. I didn't betray anyone, what are you saying!

King Yue didn't know how to speak properly. If you can't speak well, just say less. I had no choice but to integrate Su Yu's path. I am a loyal subordinate of the Human Emperor, yes, I didn't betray!

And Su Yu, hearing this, laughed, squinting his eyes, and said, "Great Zhou King, if the Human Emperor wants to turn against me, who will you fight?"

"......"

Fight your ancestors!

The Great Zhou King remained silent, not wanting to provoke trouble!

Su Yu chuckled and said, "Great Zhou King, I have a question..."

"Your Majesty, please speak!"

The Great Zhou King immediately responded, eager to change the topic and not wanting to continue the previous conversation.

"Do the Human Emperor and Culture King have a master?"

Uh...

The Great Zhou King was speechless. "Yes!"

"Are they alive? Why haven't I heard of them? Are they powerful?"

Su Yu was puzzled. The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and finally said, "Is Bai Feng alive? Is he powerful? Many people haven't heard of him!"

What a pointless question!

Geniuses are geniuses, peerless geniuses, who aren't far beyond their masters. Think about yourself; what's there to ask?

Su Yu was taken aback. That seemed true. But why did you have to jab at me while answering?

Su Yu glanced at him, feeling a bit smug!

Su Yu smiled and looked at him, and the Great Zhou King remained silent. Go ahead, look. Can you kill me?

I'm used to being given the cold shoulder!

...

After chatting for a while, Su Yu and his group set off.

Meanwhile, inside the Heaven Gate, Gui's voice came again, "Su Yu, my friends have all arrived. I need to entertain them for a while. It's best if you don't engage in any battles these days..."

Su Yu was delighted. Good news!

I've been waiting eagerly!

Great!

"Alright, go ahead. No rush!"

Gui was a bit speechless. The more Su Yu acted like this, the more worried he became.

Too generous!

No matter how many friends you call, he seems indifferent.

Fortunately, I have a clone in the Myriad Realms. He was actually a bit worried that Su Yu might set a trap... but... the Myriad Realms are so vast, he didn't believe Su Yu could arrange for everyone, especially with formidable enemies still present!

These days, he had met many people, running around and gathering information everywhere!

Su Yu couldn't possibly deal with him!

Especially with his friends arriving, knowing that some of them were first-tier!

With endless thoughts, Gui quickly probed, "Su Yu, I heard you're planning to take people to find Xingyu and the others, is that true?"

Su Yu laughed, "Not sure, why do you ask?"

Gui didn't ask further, pondering if it was because Su Yu was going to meet the Human Emperor, so he wasn't afraid of his arrival.

However, his imprint wasn't at the upper reaches of the River of Time. Su Yu wouldn't think he would descend from there, would he?

That would be a mistake!

I will descend in the area where my imprint is located!

Even if Su Yu is upstream, I will still descend in the Myriad Realms.

Unaware of his thoughts, Su Yu didn't care. Imprint? What imprint?

They're all in my world. I can move them wherever I want!

The Return

The return could only happen before Su Yu.

Gui didn't delay and quickly left to find his friends. This was a major event and a great opportunity. In recent days, he felt he was truly on the verge of returning!

Moreover, he had a deep understanding of the Myriad Realms!

Knowing oneself and the enemy, with great strength, Su Yu was so careless. Gui believed that once he descended, he could swiftly suppress the Myriad Realms, completing his transformation before the Human Emperor and others returned.

The Path of the Flesh... The Human Race's Path of the Flesh was quite good. He would find a way to claim it for himself!

He was also a strong practitioner of the Path of the Flesh. He had heard that no one currently controlled the Human Race's Path of the Flesh. Perhaps he could try, and soon, he might become a top-tier expert!

...

As for Gui, Su Yu let him be.

As long as he was happy, he could think whatever he wanted. Lantian had been having fun lately, and perhaps he had some karmic ties with Gui.

At this moment, Su Yu once again traveled upstream, with Marquis Tongtian responsible for the transmission. Su Yu was extremely fast!

...

In less than half a day, Su Yu returned once more!

Not far away, the Human Emperor, who was in seclusion, suddenly opened his eyes. The so-called seclusion... he had long stopped being in seclusion, merely waiting. He hadn't expected Su Yu to return so quickly, in less than a day.

It was almost as if nothing had changed!

In the eyes of the Human Emperor and others, the great battle had just happened yesterday, and Su Yu had already returned.

Over there, the Radiant King and others, who were chatting idly, were also stunned to see Su Yu return.

What was going on?

Was that the Yue King?

Alright, they recognized the Yue King, but the key was, how did Su Yu seem stronger after just a short trip, and he brought back several newcomers who seemed quite powerful!

The Battle King was even more bewildered. What was going on?

Was his second-tier peak status worthless now?

The Yue King seemed to be about the same level as him, and the Book Spirit and the Great Zhou King didn't seem much different either.

In just a short time, where did Su Yu find these strong individuals?

And wasn't the Yue King supposed to be dead?

However, the Human Emperor's eyes flickered. He knew how the Yue King had been resurrected. Was he placed into Wen Lao Er's world?

The Human Emperor could no longer sit still. He suddenly stood up and walked towards Su Yu.

Everyone else followed suit. The Human Emperor didn't waste words, first looking at the Yue King and sighing, "I once asked you to stay behind, thinking you were doomed... but now, it seems you've turned misfortune into fortune. I saw you swallow the path to guard the breach, and I could only watch... I have nothing else to say. Just follow Su Yu's orders. He's more cunning than I am, another Wen Lao Er. Following him, you'll find it easier to stay alive... You've already died once, don't follow me to die a second time!"

The Yue King opened his mouth, and the Human Emperor smiled, "No need to say more. Your bravery is known to all! I heard you guarded the breach for a hundred thousand years... Alas, I am ashamed before you. Following me, I am the one who should feel guilty!"

The Yue King said solemnly, "I did not fight for you, but... we are comrades. In war, someone must stay behind... it's just my duty!"

The Human Emperor said no more. He knew the situation with the Yue King.

Moreover, he didn't want to argue with Su Yu over this matter.

He said nothing more, just glanced at the Book Spirit with a peculiar look, but only glanced and said nothing, finally looking at the Great Zhou King, who hung his head in shame.

He... had not completed the task given to him by the Human Emperor.

The Human Emperor looked at the Great Zhou King for a long time before sighing, "I inquired about your situation. Although you didn't achieve great accomplishments, you managed to keep the Human Race standing for a hundred thousand years. For a hundred thousand years, the Human Race did not perish, and eventually, Su Yu arrived. You succeeded! You've worked hard over these years, guarding my body, and you've sacrificed a lot..."

The Great Zhou King hung his head, ashamed, "I am ashamed before Your Majesty! The Torchbearer lineage was ultimately destroyed by me!"

He sighed, "If not for Emperor Yu's rise, I... would have no face to meet Your Majesty!"

Beside him, Su Yu crossed his arms, smiling as he watched.

The Human Emperor said nothing more, just patted the Great Zhou King's shoulder. For a moment, his emotions were complex. How had his dark guard leader performed?

It was hard to say.

If he succeeded, he hadn't managed to unseal and complete the Human Emperor's instructions in a hundred thousand years, bringing people to support him.

If he failed, he had kept the Human Race standing for a hundred thousand years, waiting for Su Yu. The Torchbearer passed on the flame... the flame of civilization, the flame of the Human Race. The Great Zhou King had actually completed his task perfectly.

In life, how many hundred thousand years can one have?

A hundred thousand years of perseverance... whatever he said now would be inappropriate.

And the Great Zhou King, for a moment, was also filled with complex emotions, with countless things he wanted to say but didn't know what to say. After a long time, he suddenly said, "Your Majesty, these hundred thousand years, I have failed... but these hundred thousand years, I have also succeeded!"

He laughed, "I couldn't bring people to aid Your Majesty, but in these hundred thousand years, I did one thing..."

He turned his head to glance at Su Yu, feeling a bit guilty, cautiously saying, "I taught a disciple's disciple, or rather a disciple's great-grandson, who has some ability!"

The Human Emperor was slightly taken aback, looking at him, then at Su Yu.

And Su Yu, his face was calm.

Extremely calm!

Does it count?

It counts!

He knew, actually, he had long suspected.

Not far away, Wan Tiansheng walked over, looking at the Great Zhou King, his eyes flickering, and after a while, he said, "You admit it?"

The Great Zhou King felt a bit awkward, wanting to smile but unable to.

Su Yu crossed his arms, just watching the Great Zhou King, who was extremely embarrassed, lightly coughing and saying, "Back then... back then, I also wanted to use this crisis to see if a strong person could rise... as a result... as a result... it succeeded..."

Su Yu said calmly, "You succeeded! But you ruined my teacher Liu's life! I targeted you, partly because of this, and you know it, and you feel guilty! You didn't dare admit it! Today, seeing the Human Emperor, you feel protected, so you dare to admit it?"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a while before speaking, "Back then, I thought Liu Wenyan... might be the hope... but I didn't expect..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "Why didn't you dare admit it later?"

The Great Zhou King said bitterly, "Later... later, things went wrong, and I... I had no face to admit it... I kept an eye on Silk Destroying King and Control King's line, but... Sea Burning took advantage of the situation..."

"Took advantage of the situation?"

Su Yu said coldly, "Not necessarily? Most of the Liu family died, maybe you thought my teacher Liu might rise through adversity? But my teacher Liu couldn't do it, he was crushed... were you disappointed?"

The Great Zhou King remained silent.

At this moment, those who understood had some understanding, while those who didn't were utterly confused.

Soon, others gathered around.

Some had no right to speak, while others said in a deep voice, "So, the Great Zhou King is my senior uncle?"

Xia Longwu's blade aura surged, speaking in a low voice, "Is this necessary?"

The Great Zhou King remained silent.

Wan Tiansheng sneered, "Of course it's necessary. In his eyes, what are we? We are nothing. Can a strong person rise, does the process matter? It doesn't matter! He only wants the result!"

Wan Tiansheng said coldly, "A Ye Batian opened up this chaotic era of over fifty years! Without Ye Batian, the Human Race was too peaceful, the Myriad Realms didn't target us, everyone was waiting for the Upper Realm to open... but with Ye Batian, the Human Race's situation became much more difficult! Chaos breeds heroes, right?"

His eyes were cold, "If you didn't admit it, I would have thought you were long dead! Now that you've admitted it, there are consequences you should bear!"

The Great Zhou King said nothing.

Wan Tiansheng took a deep breath, "How you treated me... it doesn't matter! How you treated others, it doesn't really matter either. You cultivated the multi-character faction like raising Gu... it doesn't really matter, but tell me, did Sea Burning really lose control, or did you deliberately induce it?"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "I didn't induce Sea Burning... at that time, Control King's line was infiltrating... I had no need to induce the eternal betrayal of the Human Race. Because the Torchbearer line had suffered heavy losses, I was truly stretched thin, lacking control over the Human Race internally... leading to some changes with Sea Burning..."

"Hmph!"

Wan Tiansheng snorted coldly, "Illogical! You should know, Ye Batian was first attacked by Sea Burning. Since you are Ye Batian, you should know that Sea Burning betrayed, and then the Liu family massacre happened. Don't tell me, during this process, you didn't know Sea Burning had betrayed!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "I knew, but at that time, I wanted to leave Sea Burning for you to solve..."

"Hmph!"

Wan Tiansheng snorted coldly again, suddenly sneering after a long time, "You never admitted it before, but today you suddenly admit it. You know that with this matter weighing on our minds, even if the Human Emperor and I guessed, we wouldn't pursue it. Why do you insist on admitting it?"

"If you don't admit it, Ye Batian lives in our memories as a powerful genius who died at the hands of a traitor... without blemish. Today, you insist on breaking this tacit understanding, what do you want to prove?"

He looked at the Great Zhou King coldly, "Want to prove that in these hundred thousand years, you succeeded, you successfully brought the Human Emperor into the multi-character faction, and under the pressure of the Myriad Realms, finally rose? Is this your achievement?"

At this moment, others vaguely understood!

On Su Yu's side, everyone understood!

And on the Human Emperor's side, they had vaguely heard some things about Ye Batian before, and now, their eyes were peculiar, they all understood!

Ye Batian, who opened the multi-character faction and was hunted by the Myriad Realms, was the culprit of the Human Race's turmoil in recent decades!

Of course, perhaps also a hero!

Without Ye Batian opening this chaotic era, the day the Upper Realm opened would be the day the Human Emperor and others returned, and perhaps, there would be nothing for Su Yu.

From everyone's perspective, the Great Zhou King succeeded!

From the perspective of those involved, the Great Zhou King... was indeed detestable!

Evidently, over fifty years ago, the Great Zhou King must have been desperate. He chose a more radical approach to plunge the human race into chaos. Regardless of the process, the result was that Su Yu rose to prominence during this period. Otherwise, in a peaceful era, figures like Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng would not have emerged. The saying "heroes arise in troubled times" is not just empty words!

The Great Zhou King fell silent once more. After a while, he spoke, "I am not trying to prove that I was right, nor that I succeeded. Actually... I just wanted to give an explanation to the Human Emperor and also to Emperor Yu."

He impersonated Ye Batian... or rather, he deliberately created the persona of Ye Batian. In truth, everything unfolded as he had hoped. From Su Yu's perspective, his greatest mistake was causing the extermination of Liu Wenyan's family. However, from another perspective, the destruction of one family led to Su Yu's rise, which was a success! Otherwise, more people across the myriad realms and the human race would have perished!

At this moment, everyone else remained silent. This was not something they could easily involve themselves in.

The Human Emperor took a deep breath and said, "This matter was my arrangement..."

He had to shoulder this burden!

"I will give you and your teacher an explanation..."

Su Yu replied calmly, "There's no need."

The Human Emperor frowned slightly, "Su Yu, I know..."

Su Yu raised his hand, interrupting him, and looked at the Great Zhou King. After a long pause, he said, "Today, here with the Human Emperor, you suddenly bring this up. Your purpose isn't just that. Just say what you want to do."

The Great Zhou King fell silent again for a while before kneeling on one knee towards the Human Emperor. "Your Majesty, the task you entrusted to me back then... I have completed it! Emperor Yu has come to aid us! After ten thousand years... I think... I can take this opportunity... to leave the Torchbearer lineage, to leave... the Human Emperor's domain!"

The Human Emperor's expression was complex as he spoke softly, "You..."

The Great Zhou King bowed his head. "Your Majesty, I think perhaps... the Luminous Domain Mansion is more suitable for me now!"

The Human Emperor sighed, "You... this matter has put you in a difficult position..."

He looked at Su Yu and said softly, "This matter, you can blame it on me. Once the war is over, I will give you all an explanation!"

"No need!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King and said calmly, "Forget it, I can't be bothered to pursue this! When you meet my teacher Liu, you can explain it yourself! Ye Batian... haha!"

Su Yu sneered, "Do you really think my teacher Liu didn't suspect anything? When your identity was exposed, as the leader of the Torchbearer lineage and the head of the Human Emperor's secret guards, secretly nurturing the likes of the Great Qin King... do you really think Teacher Liu didn't understand? Couldn't guess? He just didn't want to bother with you! Teacher Liu has a knot in his heart, and that knot is that his teacher didn't die! If you were dead, he wouldn't have that knot!"

The Great Zhou King was momentarily speechless!

Today, revealing his identity and everything to Su Yu and the others was actually to inform the Human Emperor that he had completed his task and wanted to leave the Human Emperor's system to join Su Yu's system. Was this considered repayment?

Su Yu didn't know, nor did he want to know.

He didn't want to get involved in this matter. Sometimes, getting too involved in certain things wasn't good.

This was a matter between the Great Zhou King and Liu Wenyan.

Wan Tiansheng also sneered, "Forget it, the brotherhood between us as fellow disciples ended long ago! If you were dead, I'd call you senior brother. But alive... you're nothing, not worth my time!"

The Great Zhou King felt bitter.

He knew that once his identity was exposed, smart people like Su Yu would have guessed some things, but no one had said it outright. Now that he had exposed it himself, he felt very conflicted!

He had completed the task the Human Emperor had given him, exceeding expectations.

But... he still felt guilty towards some people.

Su Yu also suppressed some emotions in his heart. Soon, he said in a deep voice, "Alright, I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this! Let Ye Batian, the ancestor, live on in my heart. As for the rest... it has nothing to do with me. I don't have a master ancestor like you, the Great Zhou King... don't go claiming kinship!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, nodded, and said nothing more.

I didn't have that intention. I just wanted to be honest about some things. Everyone was pretending to be ignorant while actually understanding everything, which was also uncomfortable.

Su Yu had always targeted him, partly because of this reason.

Behind Su Yu, everyone also had strange expressions in their eyes. Soon, they stopped mentioning this matter, including Heavendoom and Tongtian, who also didn't bring it up. It wasn't something that could be easily discussed.

Strictly speaking, it was an internal conflict within the multi-character faction.

Some people had speculated before, but no one had mentioned it much.

After all, with someone like the Great Zhou King, a top genius like Ye Batian, who had the potential to inherit the Culture King's legacy, was assassinated by a traitor like the Sea Burning King. This was a significant issue.

In the early stages, not knowing his identity was one thing. But knowing it, and knowing that the Great Zhou King was nurturing top geniuses, Ye Batian shouldn't have died back then. Now, everyone naturally understood everything.

The top geniuses of the human race were actually almost all alive because the Great Zhou King needed them alive. How could he abandon the most talented Ye Batian of the century?
