Chapter 844: The Battle Begins (10,000 Words Requesting Subscription)

The Hundred Battle King had arrived, bringing with him the Human Emperor's plans and messages, as well as some coordination requirements from both sides.

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King felt somewhat uneasy. Su Yu's smile was too bright, not at all like someone about to risk his life.

He didn't want to waste time. After Su Yu had looked at him for a while, he coughed and said, "His Majesty's intention is to first intimidate the Myriad Races, to alarm them, making them think we're all bark and no bite..."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

The Hundred Battle King continued, "Back then, His Majesty's physical body was injured, and his sea of will was also wounded. Now, His Majesty wants to seize an opportunity, a chance to annihilate the Myriad Races, to fight desperately! Because our human race... has been annihilated in the Myriad Realms!"

Su Yu understood!

After thinking for a moment, he asked, "Even the human experts need to be kept in the dark?"

"Yes!"

The Hundred Battle King said solemnly, "His Majesty's intention is to fight with our backs against the wall, to burn our boats!"

"The race is extinct, and everyone has no choice but to fight!"

The Hundred Battle King said in a low voice, "Even Xingyue must pretend to be severely injured, representing... the fall of the Human Lord Su!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

"His Majesty won't make it too obvious. According to His Majesty's plan, he will first merge his physical body... but the Myriad Races will definitely discover it and will definitely try to stop it! In this, merging the physical body is the opportunity for the Myriad Races to act... His Majesty will create such an opportunity!"

Su Yu nodded again.

"At that time, the Myriad Races will have two choices: first, to fully press on and engage us in battle! Second, to split a portion, with a strong expert leading the team to intercept His Majesty's physical body!"

If they choose the first, to fully press on and ignore the issue of the physical body, then the pressure on the Human Emperor's side will be great.

However, the Hundred Battle King still said, "According to our understanding of the Myriad Races, they will definitely split their forces! No one wants to fight against His Majesty when his spirit and flesh are united!"

At this moment, he was somewhat domineering!

No one dared!

When the Human Emperor's spirit and flesh unite, even when severely injured, there will definitely be casualties among the top ranks!

At that time, those top ranks will definitely split their forces!

Therefore, the Human Emperor's side didn't even prepare for the first response plan.

Su Yu thought for a moment and asked, "What if the Myriad Races choose to turtle up?"

That's also a possibility!

I don't care about you; I'll let you merge your spirit and flesh!

"Then we'll fully press on and have a decisive battle!"

The Hundred Battle King said in a deep voice, "We will conduct pre-battle mobilization. The human race is extinct, the race is annihilated, fighting with our backs against the wall, the final battle, not stopping until most of the Myriad Races' experts have fallen! After that, our remaining troops will be defeated and scattered, and at that time, the Human Lord Su will intercept them in the middle! His Majesty also said, the Human Lord Su should not leave the ambush point, should not rescue us, it's not necessary!"

The Human Emperor's intention was clear: do not expose yourself unless the enemy enters the ambush circle. Even if some of their people die, do not expose yourself.

Once exposed, this ambush would be wasted.

Su Yu was silent for a while, then nodded, "I understand!"

The Hundred Battle King breathed a sigh of relief. As expected, Su Yu was still very sensible. He just didn't know if it was sensibility or cold-bloodedness. Of course, this wasn't his concern.

After a moment of silence, Su Yu asked, "When the Human Emperor's spirit and flesh unite, will his injuries flare up?"

"Yes!"

The Hundred Battle King nodded, "But if there's no prolonged battle, it shouldn't lead to his fall... But once there's a prolonged battle, or if the Human Lord Su's side drags on for too long, it will be troublesome. So... I personally request that if the Human Lord Su's side can resolve the battle quickly... then don't delay!"

If it drags on, even if the Human Emperor's spirit and flesh unite, he won't be able to hold on for long.

Certain death!

"Understood!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, considered for a moment, and added, "If there are people from the Human Emperor among the Myriad Races, it's best not to send them to my side, because at that time, I won't discern, nor will I spare anyone just because they claim to be from the Human Emperor!"

"Once the battle begins... anyone who trespasses into my camp is an enemy!"

Su Yu looked at the Hundred Battle King and said solemnly, "Including... your people! Please make this clear, once the battle breaks out, even your people are not allowed to cross into my battlefield! If they do, I will attack indiscriminately!"

"Then what about assisting you..."

"Not needed!"

The Hundred Battle King's teeth ached. My goodness, such arrogance, such madness!

The meaning was too clear.

I don't need your assistance; I can handle it myself, kill one if one comes.

Instead, I'll guard against you!

To prevent you from ruining my plan!

With this tone... don't say it, it's somewhat similar to the Human Emperor.

The Hundred Battle King chuckled, "Alright! By the way, does the Human Lord Su need His Majesty to support you with one or two more people besides me?"

Without me, you can't handle the top ranks!

Su Yu smiled and said, "No need, if the Hundred Battle King feels the other side is tight, you can go over there too."

"......"

The Hundred Battle King felt that Su Yu's tone was a bit out of line. Without me, you can't stop the top ranks!

Don't mess around!

He was afraid Su Yu would get stimulated and insist on not wanting any reinforcements. If he encountered a top rank, even if he joined forces with the Martial Emperor and others, they wouldn't be able to match!

Soon, the Hundred Battle King said, "That's about it! If... the Myriad Races don't split their forces as planned, and don't chase here, the Human Lord Su will remain hidden!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

The Hundred Battle King asked again, "Does the Human Lord Su have anything to convey to His Majesty?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, smiled, and said, "Tell him not to rush to die. If he dies too quickly, my pressure will be greater. If he really wants to die, wait until I reach the top rank."

"......"

These words sounded strange.

But the Hundred Battle King still nodded and said, "I won't come over at the beginning. I'll come over when the other side arrives. The Human Lord Su has no objections, right?"

"No, do as you please!"

The Hundred Battle King felt a bit uncomfortable. The way this was said, it was as if he was irrelevant.

Forget it, don't argue with young people.

Soon, the Hundred Battle King left.

...

Once the Hundred Battle King left, Su Yu exhaled lightly and looked at Xingyue not far away, "How's the reception going?"

Xingyue nodded, "Almost done. I can let the power of the heavens and earth radiate over, using my Life Path to transmit power."

"That's good!"

Su Yu actually felt it. At this moment, the long river was slightly fluctuating. Just behind him, the power of the heavens and earth was spreading over.

Not too strong!

In terms of suppression, it's probably not enough to suppress the Myriad Races, but it can allow our people to be within the range of the heavens and earth, exerting their strength within it, which is enough.

Suppressing the other side actually consumes the power of the heavens and earth. With too many people, it's hard to suppress.

Su Yu looked at Tongtian again. Marquis Tongtian looked nervous; he was under a lot of pressure.

Seeing Su Yu looking over, he forced a smile.

Su Yu also smiled, "Open a door, let everyone in to rest and also take a tour. Does your Tongtian Marquis Gate also have a world inside?"

Marquis Tongtian smiled bitterly, "Your Majesty overestimates me!"

At this time, everyone was curious. Su Yu didn't bother with them, looked at the Martial Emperor, and smiled, "Let's prepare too! We won't go in, lest we burst Tongtian!"

The Martial Emperor was sullen, knowing what to prepare for, pretending to be the Martial King!

Damn!

Not happy!

What's so good about pretending to be the Martial King?

Can't I, the Martial Emperor, suppress the world?

Alright, I really can't!

"Alright!"

The Martial Emperor replied perfunctorily. Fine, I'll pretend to be the Martial King this time. Should I pretend to be a big one, or the kind that gets beaten to the ground?

Forget it, the one getting beaten is still me.

"Xingyue doesn't need to participate in the battle, just maintain the spread of the power of the heavens and earth!"

Xingyue was a bit angry, "I can also fight, I'm not weak, I'm even close to the second rank!"

It's just that Su Yu's world can't support a second-rank existence yet.

Otherwise, she would also be a top expert.

Su Yu shook his head, "Stop talking nonsense, what do you know? You're a doctor, right? After the battle, heal us, so we don't fall and can't fight again! You need to maintain your combat power, first maintain the spread of the power of the heavens and earth... To be honest, if you have a problem, and the power of the heavens and earth can't spread here, we'll all die!"

Su Yu was extremely serious, "In this battle, you and Tongtian are the most important! If either of you makes a mistake... our side will suffer heavy losses! I've been fighting until now, and the losses have always been minimal. I don't want to embarrass myself on the Human Emperor's side in the first battle!"

"No losses, or only injuries without deaths! That's my goal!"

Everyone was silent, only injuries without deaths!

You know, this time we don't know how many strong enemies we will face.

Su Yu said calmly, "Do your best, follow me, and I'll try to keep everyone alive, but... I don't want everyone to be afraid of death during the battle! If you don't fear death during the battle, I'll do my best to save those who survive after the battle! If you fear death during the battle, causing the battle to collapse... even if the enemy doesn't kill you, I will!"

"Everyone, you've fought with me before, but... none of us have experienced large-scale battles of the rulers of laws, including myself, so we lack experience in this area... It's okay, it's actually the same, just that the power of mastering the Great Dao is stronger!"

"This time, let the Myriad Races see, and let the Human Emperor and those old seniors see, how capable we are in battle!"

Su Yu said loudly, "They think the rear is extremely safe, and we're just playing around in the rear... Wrong! We've experienced more battles in the rear than they have, we've even participated in battles involving millions and tens of millions of troops, the Human Emperor and the others don't have the chance to experience that now!"

"We've killed more people than they might have in their entire lives!"

"I, Su Yu, grew up watching Prefect Xia Longwu chop off heads... I think it's hard for them to have that experience!"

In the crowd, Xia Longwu showed a slight smile at this moment.

These words... are true!

Su Yu isn't old, and Xia Longwu started live-streaming head-chopping more than ten years ago. At that time, Su Yu had just started to remember things, and indeed grew up watching him chop off heads.

Some people weren't aware of this and were a bit surprised.

Xia Longwu... this silent man, is he that fierce?

Showing people head-chopping every day?

Su Yu continued, "Additionally, let me emphasize one point: unless I give the order, this battle will be led by Marquis Tongtian! All of you have been imprinted with his gate seal. If he needs to teleport you, do not resist! Even if you see a comrade about to die, do not rush to their aid on your own! Understood?"

The crowd exchanged glances and responded in unison, "Understood!"

This battle would be under the command of Marquis Tongtian!

Upon hearing this, sweat began to drip from Marquis Tongtian's forehead. He was genuinely nervous. As a mere gatekeeper, he was now tasked with overseeing a battle involving dozens of rulers of laws. How could he not be anxious?

Swallowing hard, he quickly said, "This battle will be guided by Destiny and Lifeless Fate. My role is to transport everyone. The three of us will assess the situation together, with His Majesty overseeing the overall strategy. I will do my utmost, and all of you just need to cooperate with me!"

Beside him, Destiny and Lifeless Fate were also somewhat tense and remained silent.

Su Yu smiled, offering reassurance, "Why so tense? The more nervous you are, the more likely you are to make mistakes. If it truly becomes necessary, I will take over. There's no need to worry!"

This eased Marquis Tongtian's anxiety somewhat.

Su Yu added, "Also, I will appear as the Culture King. Remember, when the time comes, address me as the Culture King... Don't slip up. First, we must strike at their morale and intimidate the myriad races!"

Everyone understood and nodded in agreement.

"That's all! Everyone, head inside!"

Marquis Tongtian opened the portal, and soon, everyone entered.

Su Yu then turned to Marquis Tongtian and instructed, "You will lie in ambush here, submerge yourself in the river. Remember, do not make any noise, do not probe, do not listen, until the moment the Martial Emperor and I appear to intimidate the enemy... Then you emerge, and together, we focus on killing one or two rulers of laws! Attack ten against one to ensure their death! Do not be greedy!"

Marquis Tongtian nodded quickly, committing Su Yu's words to memory, and soon submerged himself at the river's bottom.

Marquis Tongtian's true form was unique. Normally, anyone entering the river would be swept away by its currents. Even the Human Emperor's physical body on Ren Mountain would face issues from the river's impact, but Marquis Tongtian was unaffected.

The Human Emperor and others resided on a continent, which was actually quite special, created by a special power of laws, akin to a floating bridge. Generally, people would not venture into the river due to its dangers. However, Marquis Tongtian was unharmed, something Su Yu had tested before.

Indeed, as Marquis Tongtian submerged, he faced no issues. Su Yu speculated that Marquis Tongtian's portals might be related to the Master of Time, and the portals could have originated from the River of Time—a special rule that might have been born from it. Perhaps they were originally one entity.

Su Yu then turned to Xingyue, who hadn't entered, and said sternly, "You retreat to the rear and maintain the spread of the power of heaven and earth, keeping a distance from us!"

Xingyue replied seriously, "Shouldn't I join the battle? I can heal everyone on the spot..."

"Healing during a battle is a death wish!"

Su Yu shook his head, "We'll discuss it after the battle. Go now!"

"I..."

"Follow orders!"

Su Yu's expression turned cold, and although Xingyue was displeased, she obediently retreated, muttering as she went, "You're my subordinate, yet you dare to order me..."

Despite her words, she complied, knowing Su Yu's anger was not to be trifled with.

Watching her leave, Su Yu shook his head. I was just saying it casually, and you took it seriously!

With that, Su Yu, accompanied by the Martial Emperor, also moved to the rear. As they walked, Su Yu's appearance began to change—his face became somewhat ethereal. He didn't need to ask what the Culture King looked like; it wasn't necessary. For a powerful figure, it was all about the aura!

Reaching out, Su Yu grasped a pen, a manifestation of the pen dao's power. Even though he had abandoned the pen dao, the power of the pen dao was now controlled by his own people, and it existed within his own world. He could still wield some of its power.

The pen, like a long spear, was casually held in his hand.

At this moment, the Martial Emperor, albeit reluctantly, also changed his appearance. His golden armor vanished, leaving his upper body bare, with a mass of chest hair growing on his chest...

The Martial Emperor's appearance changed somewhat.

In terms of aura... there wasn't much difference, but he appeared more ferocious.

The two of them, one posing as the Culture King and the other as the Martial King, truly looked the part!

At this time, a long spear appeared in the Martial Emperor's hand, his teeth bared, exuding a chilling aura as he glared at Su Yu.

Su Yu turned to look at him, and the Martial Emperor grinned, "That bastard Taishan was always like this, fierce all day long!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Is that so? Alright then!"

The Martial Emperor was indeed familiar with the Martial King, having held a grudge for countless years. The two were quite similar, and his disguise was convincing. His aura was second-tier, just like the Martial King back in the day, though certainly not now.

However, having just entered the second tier, he was still somewhat weaker.

Su Yu instructed, "No need to deliberately conceal your aura, just appear as if you're gravely injured and on the brink of death. Reveal your second-tier aura. We're supposed to have just fought our way out of the Heaven Gate, understood? Stain yourself with some blood..."

Under Su Yu's guidance, the Martial Emperor soon had bloodstains and appeared somewhat weakened.

As for Su Yu, he remained unchanged.

A person like the Culture King, even when gravely injured, would not show any signs of fatigue. His white robe would still be as pristine as snow, without a doubt. Everyone was the same; no one would let outsiders see them as a joke.

The dignity of a scholar!

With everything prepared, Su Yu could only rely on luck now. He hoped not too many first-tier experts would come.

If only one came, Su Yu was confident.

With borrowed power and the radiation of his world, Su Yu could barely possess first-tier strength. He could handle one first-tier expert alone, even if he couldn't kill them, he could hold them off.

With the Martial Emperor, Zhan Wang, and others present, they could hold off several second-tier experts. Zhan Wang was also strong.

Others, entering his world, included quite a few third-tier experts.

The fear was... more than one first-tier expert arriving!

That would be a big problem!

This depended on the Human Emperor's side. Could the Human Emperor hold off more first-tier experts?

Su Yu looked ahead, as if he could see that shadow. Human Emperor, are you ready?

...

Human Realm Continent.

The Human Emperor's shadow also looked back. Behind him stood a group of powerful figures.

Each wore a solemn expression.

The Human Emperor had gathered everyone, even recalling the patrolling experts. Was a battle truly imminent?

At this moment, the Human Emperor spoke, his voice calm, "The battle is about to begin!"

Everyone's expressions tensed!

No one spoke, waiting for the Human Emperor's next words.

The Human Emperor continued, "Did you all know Xingyue left earlier?"

Someone nodded.

"She was injured!"

The Human Emperor remained calm, "Something happened in the Myriad Realms. It seems Su Yu has fallen, and our Human Race... is likely to be annihilated!"

At these words, everyone's aura fluctuated!

How could this be!

Yet, no one interrupted.

The Human Emperor continued, "Now, there is only one path... to take the initiative, crush the myriad races, and return to aid the Myriad Realms! Otherwise, if we leave first, those guys will encircle us from behind. If the Myriad Realms face trouble... we'll be caught between two fronts!"

At this moment, someone spoke. A female warrior with a fierce aura stepped forward, her red hair blazing, wielding a large machete. She spoke in a muffled voice, "Your Majesty, is this battle a decisive one?"

"Yes!"

The Human Emperor looked at the fierce woman and smiled, "Marshal of War, I... may not have the chance to take you to find Taishan."

The Marshal of War was not among the 36 Kings.

She was only recently conferred the title.

The Martial King's dao companion, a top-tier first-tier expert, held a high status here, second only to the Human Emperor and Radiant King.

The fierce woman, with a wild aura, was not unattractive, but her physique was extremely robust. Upon hearing this, she snorted, "No matter, I'll consider him dead! Since Your Majesty wishes to fight... that dead ghost isn't here, we will fight in his stead. Our Martial King's Mansion committed a grave mistake back then. Now, we sisters will fight in his place, determined to take the enemy's head!"

Killing intent surged!

From then until now, she had fought her way into the first tier. This Marshal of War had more killing intent than many of the Human Kings present.

The Martial King had committed a grave mistake back then, exposing the Culture King's departure, leading to chaos in the Myriad Realms. To atone for the Martial King's sins, the female generals of the Martial King's Mansion had fought relentlessly. All 18 of the Martial King's dao companions had chosen to follow the Human Emperor into battle!

Now, half of them had fallen in battle!

The remaining ones were all rulers of laws, top-tier existences. Among the 52 rulers of laws, the Martial King's Mansion accounted for nine!

The Human Emperor laughed!

"Marshal of War, a heroine among women, not yielding to men!"

The Human Emperor laughed, "It's a pity that Taishan isn't here. Otherwise... today, I would have made him apologize to you sisters. To save that old second of the Culture King, he abandoned his sisters... is he even human?"

Everyone suddenly laughed!

The Human Emperor also laughed, "Prepare yourselves, wait for my physical body to return! My body has been injured for years... now, it's time to reunite. Today, let's turn the heavens and earth upside down!"

"Kill!"

Everyone shouted lowly, their morale high!

With the Human Emperor present, there was no fear!

No matter how many powerful enemies there were, they were fearless.

As long as the Human Emperor was there, they were invincible.

No matter how many enemies there were!

...

At this time.

On the Myriad Races Continent, suddenly, several powerful figures felt a sense of unease.

"The other side... such intense killing intent!"

"Are they really going to fight?"

"Are they crazy? Their numbers are less than half of ours. Are they trying to scare us?"

"......"

Despite their doubts, at this moment, one by one, the powerful figures quickly gathered. At this time, the Immortal Emperor of the Immortal Race, a strong figure with an immortal aura, snow-white hair, and a handsome appearance, stepped forward.

He looked at everyone, then at the other side, frowning slightly. In his eyes, the sun and moon rotated, the heavens and earth tilted. His voice was ethereal, "On the other side, tensions are high. I don't know if it's a bluff or what, but... everyone, be prepared!"

"To prevent a surprise attack from the other side!"

With the Immortal Emperor speaking, everyone nodded. The Immortal Emperor held high prestige here.

He was skilled in the path of longevity and had healed many rulers of laws here.

Without him, the myriad races wouldn't have so many rulers of laws. Everyone respected him greatly.

In the presence of the Immortal Emperor, a dignified middle-aged man with sharp eyebrows and a cold gaze addressed the assembly, "I understand that none of you wish to engage in a life-and-death battle at this moment... However, should the humans initiate war, I implore you all to set aside everything and focus solely on the enemy!"

If not for some fearing death, they would have long since taken the initiative against the humans. Most preferred a defensive stance. Yet, if the humans declared war, they would have no choice but to fight.

The gathered were all powerful beings, and they understood this well. Soon, someone chuckled, "As long as the humans dare to act, we shall strike them down! Rest assured, Divine Emperor, we merely wish to wait until the Myriad Realms converge before making our move... But if the humans seek death, we shall oblige them!"

The Divine Emperor nodded slightly, "As per the usual arrangement, if a great war breaks out, I will join forces with the Immortal Emperor and the Demon Emperor to restrain the Human Emperor! The rest of you... find your own opponents!"

In past minor skirmishes, this had been the strategy. The three most powerful would confront the Human Emperor. Often, the Human Emperor's shadow would not even need to act, but his presence alone was enough to deter the three mighty beings.

No one objected, even if they themselves did not engage. They had agreed to bear the brunt of the Human Emperor's power. Everyone feared the Human Emperor, but the other rulers of laws among the humans, even the Radiant King, did not inspire the same fear.

At this moment, the three mighty beings exchanged glances. The Demon Emperor's voice carried a fierce edge, "What is the Human Emperor planning?"

None could decipher it.

Just then, among the crowd, a ruler of laws with twitching ears seemed to be listening intently. Suddenly, he spoke, "Fellow Daoists, I think I hear something..."

All eyes turned to him.

The Whispering Ear!

His ears were large, and waves of sound seemed to ripple from them as he listened intently. "From the direction of the River... yes, beyond the River, something seems to be approaching... The disturbance is strong!"

Ordinary disturbances were suppressed by the Human Emperor, making it difficult for them to sense anything. But this time, the disturbance was significant.

He listened carefully, when suddenly, a sharp laugh echoed from the opposite side, "Big-eared thief, what are you eavesdropping on?"

The voice was piercingly sharp!

Boom!

Waves of Dao resonance swept over, and the big-eared expert's expression changed. In the next moment, the Demon Emperor punched out, boom!

A loud explosion followed!

A wave of Dao resonance shattered!

The Demon Emperor coldly shouted, "Courting death! Sound King, how dare you make the first move!"

One of the thirty-six Human Kings!

An old Human King!

Despite the words, everyone exchanged strange glances. What was the other side hiding?

What was coming from beyond the River, causing such a strong disturbance? What was it?

A powerful being?

Was a human powerhouse coming to aid them?

Even the Human Emperor couldn't suppress the disturbance. If it was a powerhouse, that would be terrifying!

If not a powerhouse, then what was it?

For a moment, everyone grew anxious. The Divine Emperor spoke solemnly, "Great Ear, keep listening! Eight Eyes, see if you can spot anything!"

In the crowd, a person suddenly opened his eyes—eight of them!

His eight eyes shone with divine light as he looked forward, penetrating the heavens and the River of Dao. He looked deeply, and after a while, he vaguely saw something. Just as he was about to look further, someone on the opposite side, with a single eye suspended on their forehead, flashed golden light. With a loud bang, Eight Eyes and the other clashed, each taking a step back.

On the human side, a handsome young man sneered, "Eight Eyes, what are you trying to see? How about I show you?"

Eight Eyes' eight eyes instantly filled with killing intent, "Eye King, this emperor would like to test your three-eyed golden pupil, to see if your single eye is stronger or my eight-eyed divine pupil!"

"You'll find out. Haven't you tried before?"

The handsome young man sneered, unafraid. They had fought for many years, and he did not fear Eight Eyes.

Eight Eyes ignored him, quickly growing serious, "Everyone, something's not right. I vaguely saw... a mountain!"

A mountain?

Everyone was taken aback. What mountain?

Eight Eyes quickly said, "It seems like a mountain, moving towards us, its golden light blinding. I only caught a glimpse, but it felt extremely terrifying!"

Everyone's hearts tightened. Although Eight Eyes wasn't the strongest, he possessed the power of a third-tier ruler of laws.

He only caught a glimpse, yet felt fear.

And the other side was continuously concealing something.

While concealment was normal, today, it seemed unusual!

In fact, Eight Eyes saw more than just the mountain. He vaguely saw two people, but it was too blurry to determine if they truly existed. After some thought, he decided not to mention it.

He wanted to look again. Otherwise, if the information was wrong and led to a war with the fall of a ruler of laws, the responsibility would be too great!

Meanwhile, the big-eared expert spoke solemnly, "A mountain? Why do I hear... someone on the move!"

Mountain, person...

At this moment, the Divine Emperor and the others exchanged glances. Moments later, the Divine Emperor's eyes shifted slightly, speaking softly, "Mountain... person... what do you think it is?"

The Immortal Emperor's eyes flickered, fingers calculating, suddenly his expression changed, "Could it be... he's coming in person?"

"Hmm?"

The powerful beings instantly grew serious, understanding what he meant.

No way!

The Human Emperor's true form had been missing for years. It was speculated he was severely injured, hiding somewhere, either beneath the continent or within the River, healing.

But now, with the Immortal Emperor's words, everyone grew tense.

Since the Human Emperor's true form disappeared, there had been wars, but mostly small-scale battles. Full-scale battles were rare, and few rulers of laws had fallen in recent years.

What were the humans planning?

"If he's coming in person... then it's a blood battle!"

The Demon Emperor also grew serious, "Have the humans truly been exterminated?"

With this thought, he quickly turned, speaking solemnly, "Observe the humans' fate!"

In the crowd, another emperor quickly utilized the power of the Dao, his eyes revealing a white light, suddenly looking towards the humans. He was momentarily stunned, then slightly lost composure. In the next moment, his pupils suddenly exploded!

From the opposite side, a cold shout echoed, "Courting death?"

The emperor with the exploded pupils, in disbelief, said, "No... something's not right... the humans' fate... seems... severed!"

Boom!

One by one, the powerful beings' auras erupted instantly.

What?

Severed?

"Yes... it's severed... like a rootless duckweed... the humans... have been exterminated!"

At this moment, the expert who spoke these words was also horrified.

The humans... have been exterminated!

The Myriad Races over there were too ruthless.

Exterminating the humans, the humans must have felt it. This was... forcing the humans into a death battle!

In an instant, the powerful beings' expressions changed completely.

The humans were exterminated!

At this moment, everyone was shocked, and the expert observing fate was indeed not mistaken. The humans' fate, or rather the ancient fate, was indeed severed. When the Heaven Monitoring Marquis was integrated into Su Yu's world, it was severed.

And now, the humans only recognized Su Yu. Who recognized the Human Emperor?

The humans' fate was converging towards Su Yu's world!

And the Human Emperor and the others had indeed become rootless duckweed!

Suddenly, the Immortal Emperor's expression also changed, becoming extremely heavy, "Prepare for battle! Decisive battle! Death battle!"

The humans were exterminated!

Everyone was extremely shocked. No wonder the other side seemed off. Had the Myriad Races birthed several rulers of laws, and in this period, wiped out the humans?

The powerful beings couldn't help but curse!

Wiping out the humans... wasn't this forcing the Human Emperor and the others into madness?

"It's his true form coming!"

The Immortal Emperor no longer held any hope, speaking heavily, "Spirit and flesh separation... I understand, he wants to unite spirit and flesh. His injuries may not be healed, but... he wants to fight us!"

With these words, everyone instantly grew serious!

The Divine Emperor's expression also shifted, "He wants to unite spirit and flesh, it's his physical body coming..."

He looked at the others, his gaze changed. This battle was unavoidable!

Because the Myriad Races' people were too ruthless, exterminating the humans!

The Human Emperor, worried about enemies on all sides, and now without a race, was likely already mad. Thus... the Divine Emperor and the others instantly reached a consensus, "The three of us will encircle the Human Emperor! The Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Emperor will encircle the Radiant King! Nether Emperor, you lead your people... intercept and prevent the Human Emperor's physical body from uniting!"

At this moment, the powerful beings instantly reached a consensus!

They had to take the initiative to prevent him from uniting spirit and flesh!

Usually, the Human Emperor wouldn't take the initiative, but today, upon learning that the humans were truly exterminated, this battle was unavoidable!

"Kill!"

With an angry shout, in the next moment, on the continent, the powerful beings quickly charged out!

The Myriad Races, at this moment, also knew they couldn't avoid the battle, so they took the initiative!

At the same time, on the Human Emperor's side, the concealment could no longer hold!

Beyond the River, a massive mountain suddenly appeared, beginning to crack, a golden light shining across the River!

From within the massive mountain, a golden-robed figure suddenly emerged.

As this physical body appeared, the River stagnated!

However, this physical body bore many wounds, countless ages unable to heal.

At this moment, the Human Emperor's voice resonated, filled with majesty, anger, and killing intent, his shout shaking the heavens and earth!

"The Myriad Races have exterminated my humans, this battle, a battle to the death!"

"Everyone, follow me into battle!"

Boom!

A surge of incomparably powerful auras instantly erupted to the extreme!

The great war erupted!

The Human Emperor's shadow did not join the battle, but quickly flew to the rear, seeking to unite spirit and flesh. The Radiant King's shout also resonated instantly, "Block the Myriad Races, let His Majesty unite spirit and flesh, and slaughter the Myriad Races!"

"Yes!"

A resounding shout echoed, a group of human powerhouses, their killing intent shaking the heavens, their battle intent overwhelming!

Block them!

Block them!

Let the Human Emperor unite spirit and flesh, the Emperor's return, victory assured!

"Stop him!"

The Divine Emperor's voice also erupted instantly, to stop the Human Emperor!

To unite, wishful thinking!

Previously unaware of your true form's situation, today everyone saw clearly, completely unconscious, the physical body injured, yet even so, you cannot be allowed to unite!

"The Human Emperor is gravely injured, this battle will be his death!"

The Immortal Emperor shouted, and the morale of the Myriad Races surged! The Human Emperor was indeed gravely injured! All the powerful beings could sense it!

"Kill, exterminate the humans, return to the Myriad Realms!"

"Kill!"

"..."

Between the two continents, powerful beings clashed instantly, the power of the Great Dao surged, and the River of Time trembled. At this moment, even the entire River of Time was quaking!

The great battle erupted!

...

At this moment, in the Upper Realm.

Feeling that faint tremor, the Great Zhou King, who was meditating in front of the Gate of Hell, changed his expression.

The great battle... had erupted!

The Human Emperor really went mad together with Su Yu.

The Great Zhou King smirked, "Is it contagious? Even His Majesty has been influenced by this guy, or perhaps... His Majesty has truly decided to let him lead the human race?"

A sigh escaped him. Your Majesty, have you made your decision?

So be it, so be it!

Even if I reach the pinnacle... I can't change the situation!

Even if I become the pinnacle, I can't change anything.

"Su Yu... you... are truly insane!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, a true madman.

Too crazy!

He hadn't been gone long, and yet he made the Human Emperor choose to burn his bridges. If you're not a madman, what are you?

The spark of humanity... how can it rely on me alone to carry on?

I... can't do it.

At this moment, he laughed, stepped out, and entered Su Yu's world with a smile. Ten Great Daos appeared on his body, two connecting to Su Yu's world, and eight to the River of Time.

"What a pity... I... am truly reluctant!"

A long sigh, filled with infinite sorrow.

"Su Yu, you little brat, always targeting me, does it feel good?"

"Heh!"

"If it weren't for me, would you have what you have today?"

"Heh!"

"I've protected the human race for a hundred thousand years, how could a presumptuous junior like you understand!"

"If I had recklessly exposed myself early on, all your ancestors would have died, and you still have the face to target me?"

The Great Zhou King laughed, and with a bang, severed his Great Dao. The power of the Dao instantly merged into Su Yu's world.

In the distance, Lantian grinned mischievously and began recording.

Just as he started recording, suddenly, someone appeared before him. The Great Zhou King, while severing his Dao, grabbed Lantian. Lantian was about to mock him, thinking he had countless avatars, but suddenly, the Great Zhou King reached out, and countless nets appeared, capturing countless Lantian avatars!

"You'll never understand how powerful I am. With Su Yu not here, you dare to provoke me, you brat?"

The Great Zhou King sneered, punching one of Lantian's avatars, leaving it bruised and swollen. In the next moment, all the avatars had bruised and swollen faces!

Lantian's mouth gaped open!

"This is called the Thousand Threads Dao, one body transmitting to a thousand bodies... Idiot, did you really think you were invincible?"

The Great Zhou King severed his Dao while furiously beating Lantian!

I'll let you disgust me, you brat!

I'll let you record me cursing Su Yu!

I'll beat you to death, you brat!

While I'm still strong, I can't beat you to death!

Boom!

A series of explosions sounded, and Su Yu's world rapidly expanded, while Lantian's avatars, numbering over a thousand, were all beaten, each one running away with their heads in their hands!

So painful!

Damn it!

Too painful!

The Great Zhou King sneered, "Let me give you something fun, the Pain Dao, pain sensation multiplied by a hundred!"

"And let me add something more, something fun... Puppet Dao!"

In an instant, all the Lantian avatars froze like puppets, and in the next moment, they all spoke, "Grandfather, spare me!"

Control!

The Great Zhou King felt refreshed, delighted!

I'll let you be arrogant!

When Su Yu is around, I don't beat you, and you think I really can't beat you?

Heh!

He was satisfied, and in the next moment, over a thousand Lantian avatars suddenly transformed into women, kneeling and begging, "Daddy, don't hit me, it hurts, I won't dare anymore..."

"..."

The Great Zhou King's face changed!

Damn you!

In that instant, countless people looked over, only to see the Great Zhou King suddenly holding a whip, whipping over a thousand women!

A group of people widened their eyes.

Oh my, how explosive!

The Great Zhou King's face turned green, looking at Lantian, who had a hint of a smile in his eyes, "I'm a pervert... you're even more of a pervert, daddy, stop hitting me, if you keep hitting, I'll strip!"

The Great Zhou King was utterly speechless!

In an instant, he severed the Dao and vanished. Damn it, Su Yu is a pervert, and there's no one under him who isn't a pervert!

And Lantian, patting his clothes, stood up, laughed, and looked into the distance, addressing the crowd with a coquettish smile, "Stop looking, I was just playing with the Great Zhou King. The Great Zhou King is so cute, I like him... even more than I like Tiansheng, he's shy now..."

A group of people shivered, scattering quickly, too terrifying!

But the scene they just witnessed was still too explosive!

My heavens, in the blink of an eye, all the powerful beings in the world were discussing it, no one cared about the expansion of the world anymore, this was far more explosive than the Great Zhou King and Lantian playing perverted games in public!

In the distance, the Great Zhou King severed the last thread of his Dao, suddenly feeling infinitely melancholic. I'm so powerful, yet I'm still disgusted by Lantian, this life... is unbearable!

"Your Majesty... you must win!"

The Great Zhou King suddenly felt infinitely melancholic, looking at Lantian chasing from afar, his body trembled, and he fled instantly. I can't kill him, I don't want to be disgusted to death, I can only escape!
