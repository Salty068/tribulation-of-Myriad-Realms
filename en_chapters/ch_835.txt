Chapter 835: Breakthroughs (Seeking Subscriptions)

Merging with a past self, and yet there's so much gossip involved. The key point is, it's gossip about myself. And then there's the Great Zhou King, a powerhouse of seven paths. Are these seven paths actual paths, or just a naming convention for a certain realm or power level?

"And then... there's the bloodline of Wen. If Nanyuan is filled with Wen's bloodline, why would this shadow specifically choose me? Can the power of fate from the future influence the past?"

If that's the case, did the other party choose me because of some connection to my current memory retrieval?

That would be impressive—being powerful enough in the future to influence the past. But without merging with the Book of Time, there wouldn't be a future me...

This is quite a conundrum.

Su Yu suddenly asked, "I've merged with the past self of this period. Can I go back again and merge once more?"

Wan Tiansheng shook his head immediately. "Impossible. The past is singular, while the future holds countless possibilities! So once you've merged with the past self of this period, that's it. There's no second chance!"

Su Yu felt a bit regretful. Actually, I wanted to see a little more of the memories from just before this, or perhaps, for instance, when the shadow appeared, I could see where the Great Zhou King was.

At this moment, Su Yu thought of something and glanced at the South Heavenly King. The South Heavenly King seemed a bit off earlier.

Seeing Su Yu's gaze, the South Heavenly King spoke in a somewhat somber tone, "That person... as the Great Zhou King said, might indeed be Xing! The voice sounded vaguely familiar... Xing... the era of Xing isn't that far back. He and the Undead Emperor might have existed in the same era..."

The Undead Emperor was someone Su Yu originally intended to bring along, but the Undead Emperor was somewhat repelled by the source. Su Yu guessed it was probably because he had merged with his source, leaving no mark in the past, making it impossible to enter the River of Memories.

This time, Chen wasn't here. Otherwise, perhaps he could have identified the shadow's identity.

However, the South Heavenly King's attitude was strange.

Aren't you a fan of the Culture King?

Why does it seem like hearing Xing's voice also unsettled you?

"Did the South Heavenly King have any interactions with Xing?"

Su Yu asked, and after a moment of silence, the South Heavenly King replied, "No, but... I vaguely remember that this person once visited my race and had some connection with a celestial maiden of my race!"

Celestial maiden!

Su Yu's heart stirred. The Celestial Race!

As expected, he had previously speculated that the South Heavenly King was either from the Celestial Race or the Soul Pearl Race, and it turned out to be the Celestial Race. The title of celestial maiden seemed to be a leadership position within the Celestial Race.

The South Heavenly King continued in a low voice, "That celestial maiden... met a tragic end later. This Xing is not a good person. In your words, he's an old scoundrel!"

Really?

Su Yu was surprised. Was there such gossip?

But the South Heavenly King is quite ancient. From the sound of it, she might have heard Xing's voice during the early Taikoo or the end of the opening of the heavens, possibly even being from the same era as Chen.

Su Yu had never asked about the South Heavenly King's past. Some things, if others don't mention them, he doesn't ask.

But at this moment, he couldn't help but ask, "South Heavenly King... were you from the end of the opening of the heavens?"

The South Heavenly King replied irritably, "I died early, so I'm not that old!"

"..."

What a way to put it. I didn't say you were old.

Speechless!

Women, huh!

Died early, so not old?

Fine, if you say so.

The South Heavenly King added, "That person should indeed be Xing, but he should have entered the Heaven Gate long ago. If he's not dead, why did he come out? To find Xingyu... Xingyu should be his descendant, but I don't know who this old scoundrel had a child with!"

Su Yu was speechless, hearing the words tinged with resentment. Suddenly, a thought occurred to him, one he could hardly believe. He whispered, "South Heavenly King... you wouldn't be Xing's daughter, would you?"

"Heh!"

The South Heavenly King sneered, "How could that be! It's just that... the celestial maiden he once flirted with was an elder of mine, and she met a tragic end. Seeing him puts me in a bad mood!"

Is that so?

Alright then!

Su Yu didn't press further. These were old matters, and over the years, everyone has their own perspective.

Su Yu suddenly thought of another point: "According to what he said, Wen and the others might also be alive, inside the Heaven Gate, including Xing. If he's so powerful, why didn't he help the Culture King and the others?"

Because according to the mark left by the Time Sage, she was nearing her end, and her brother, the Culture King, was also nearing his end, unable to match their formidable enemies.

No mention of anyone helping them!

Why is that?

And the Great Zhou King, with a sigh, said, "Your Majesty, they... might not be stronger than the Culture King!"

"Hmm?"

Su Yu was taken aback. The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, "Your Majesty... they are ancient and powerful, but to say they are definitely stronger than the Culture King... that's not certain! The Culture King was classified as first-class back then! Now, if there's something above first-class... the Culture King might be above first-class! Your Majesty, the Culture King is a supreme powerhouse, a true supreme powerhouse. Don't think the Culture King is weak..."

Does everyone seem stronger than the Culture King to you?

The Great Zhou King added, "The Culture King and the Human Emperor were the most powerful beings after the Taikoo era! They established the Myriad Realms, primarily led by the Human Emperor and the Culture King, suppressing the myriad races and emperors! So, when the Culture King and the Human Emperor were around, even if the Human Race had fewer rulers of laws than the opponents, they could still suppress the Myriad Realms! But when one of them was gone, changes quickly occurred."

In summary, the Culture King was formidable!

Su Yu nodded, and the Great Zhou King continued, "Based on current circumstances, the Culture King and the Human Emperor are supreme powerhouses, second only to the Lord of the Undead! And the Human Emperor's ancestor, Xing, might not be as strong as the Human Ancestor... probably not! According to current understanding, the Human Ancestor is the leader of the Human Race, while they were just leaders of a tribe, subordinates of the Human Ancestor... not as strong as the Human Ancestor!"

"The Human Ancestor could rival the Lord of the Undead, but that's just a legend. Xing and these powerhouses are not as strong as the Human Ancestor! So, they likely can't compare to the Culture King and the others..."

Su Yu was surprised, "So, you're saying he might just be first-class? Not as strong as the current Culture King and the others?"

"That's my judgment!"

Su Yu nodded, finding some logic in it. However, he frowned, "Then why did he come out of the Heaven Gate, claiming to suppress the Heaven Gate..."

The Great Zhou King sighed, "If he could come out easily, he would have done so long ago. I suspect he relied on the Time Sage's power to barely come out, and his strength might not match the Lord of the Undead!"

Su Yu thought carefully and found it reasonable. "So, this person's strength... might not even match the Time Sage? Perhaps it was the Time Sage's full-force attack that broke the Heaven Gate, and he just took advantage of it to come out?"

"Most likely!"

The Great Zhou King spoke again, and Su Yu stroked his chin, glancing at the Great Zhou King. Why was he so certain?

The Great Zhou King sighed again, "Actually... it's not hard to guess. He called me a supreme of seven paths... this person... ahem, probably not that strong! Your Majesty thinks, would the Culture King and the Human Emperor, upon seeing me, call me a supreme of seven paths?"

"..."

Su Yu's mouth opened. Wow, what you said makes so much sense!

I can't argue with that.

Su Yu laughed, "So, he might just be a first-class powerhouse."

Just?

This statement left the Great Zhou King at a loss for words.

First-class, the level of the ancient Human Kings and Human Emperor, has it come to be regarded as just that?

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and said, "I don't know the specifics, but most likely not as strong as the Human Emperor. You heard him say he was looking for Xingyu, and Xingyu, in his words, is also a supreme powerhouse... so perhaps he's not as strong as the Human Emperor!"

Alright!

Hearing the Great Zhou King's analysis, Su Yu also felt it was likely.

"So, he just used the Time Sage's power to come out, but I suspect he has no connection with the Time Sage. He might know some things, even observing in secret, but he probably hasn't communicated with the Time Sage... otherwise, the Book of Time wouldn't be sent to find the Human Emperor or return home, and the Time Sage wouldn't remain silent!"

Su Yu squinted his eyes, "So, these people might not be good people!"

Watching the Time Sage fall into distress, they didn't help but instead followed the Book of Time out. Were they looking for reinforcements?

Or did they have another purpose?

Anyway, this Xing might not be a good person, possibly not even as strong as his countless generations of descendants, the Human Emperor.

At this moment, Su Yu stopped speaking. A surge of overwhelming aura erupted from his body, his physical form rumbling, constantly cracking!

The past self was very powerful!

The power of Xing, the power of the Book of Time, all gathered on Su Yu at that moment. Little Su Yu must have been very powerful!

And just when everyone thought Su Yu was about to merge with his past self, Su Yu suddenly grabbed Little Su Yu and smashed him to pieces with a punch...

"..."

Everyone was stunned!

And Su Yu, ignoring them, shattered Little Su Yu and continued to devour the power. With the power of the same source, Su Yu absorbed it while explaining, "Su Yu is only one person. I don't need to merge with all past and future selves. Extracting the source power is enough!"

"There might be some loss of power, but it prevents the situation where one body is destroyed, and the other is weakened..."

The South Heavenly King couldn't help but say, "You... killed your younger self?"

Too ruthless!

Not human at all!

Su Yu explained, "That wasn't me, nor my younger self, just some imprints of my source..."

"You killed your younger self! Killed Little Su Yu!"

At this moment, the South Heavenly King was being serious. Regardless of whether it was an imprint, you ruthlessly killed your younger self!

Su Yu, so ruthless!

Su Yu was helpless. Women, huh!

What do you mean my younger self?

Just an imprint!

It's like taking a photo of myself and tearing it up. Does that count as killing myself?

What logic is that!

He just didn't like the idea of a little Su Yu suddenly appearing during a battle, a six-year-old version, coming out to fight.

That would be no fun!

Su Yu stood amidst a group of men, discussing the intricacies of merging his three bodies. "It's not about having two extra lives," he explained. "What I need is the power of the source. If I choose to merge rather than shatter them now, the three bodies will share their strength. Only by uniting them can I enhance myself. Separating them would lead to decline, which is not ideal. So, if I merge the three bodies, I must do it in a way that shatters my past and future, integrating them into myself."

The men nodded in understanding, and even the South Heavenly King, who understood the concept, remarked, "You're too ruthless. Such a young child, losing his mother early, and now you've killed him too!"

"That was me!" Su Yu retorted, exasperated. "South Heavenly King, stop with the sympathy. That was me!"

The South Heavenly King thought for a moment and nodded. "True, it's your own experience. Still, you were cuter as a child. Maybe when you're alone, you could revert to that form. It would be more endearing!"

Su Yu was speechless. If you were a man, I'd punch you until you cried!

The Great Zhou King and the others stifled their laughter as Su Yu continued to absorb the power of the source, strengthening himself. His body swelled with power, and he sighed, shaking his head. "I can't merge more past and future selves. My source hasn't fully integrated yet. It seems my physical body can't handle it. The only solution is to use the Human Lord Seal to summon another future self. I'll merge when needed and set it aside when not."

"When I'm strong enough, I'll kill the future self and absorb it."

The others shivered at his calm discussion of killing himself. This guy was truly ruthless, both to himself and others!

Su Yu pondered further. "The future self doesn't need to be too strong, just about my current level. Otherwise, a too-powerful future is unreliable. I've always felt that the future self is the least reliable, its power illusory, and there's even a possibility of borrowing power."

Wan Tiansheng spoke gravely, "You mean the future self borrows power from a certain moment?"

Su Yu nodded. "For instance, if I merge with a future self, and that future self is me at a peak moment, it might not affect me now. But when I reach that moment, I might suddenly lose power because my past self borrowed it."

"Power can't just appear out of nowhere!"

Su Yu laughed. "For the past self, I'm borrowing the power of the Book of Time and the stars from back then. That's why the Book of Time hasn't recovered for years! As for the future self, don't make it too strong. If you draw too much power, you might end up killing yourself in a crucial battle."

The group contemplated his words, and Wan Tiansheng asked, "Then if I only merge with the next moment's self, will I lose power in the next moment?"

Su Yu considered. "Maybe! You can try it. Usually, people choose a strong future moment, not the next one."

He smiled. "I could try it, but in the next moment, I might weaken because I've borrowed future power. How long this weak period lasts, I don't know. If you're interested, you could experiment."

Recently, things weren't too busy, so they could afford to try it.

Su Yu decided to act on his thoughts. He summoned the Human Lord Seal, a powerful seal, and reached into the River of Time, pulling out a version of himself almost identical to his current self. This future Su Yu merged into the Human Lord Seal, and a powerful Su Yu emerged, merging with him.

This time, Su Yu didn't shatter the future self. He couldn't absorb more power now. But this future self wasn't weak, matching Su Yu's current strength.

As Su Yu's strength continued to rise, nearing the second tier, he was almost at the level of the Martial Emperor, about to step into the second tier. Outside the world, he had already improved significantly!

Within the world, Su Yu was a strong second-tier ruler of laws. Outside, he possessed second-tier power, but not too strong.

Soon, a similar Su Yu emerged from his body, and his aura fell back to the peak of the third tier. Su Yu shook his head. "Mediocre!"

Two peak third-tier Su Yus could combine into a second-tier Su Yu, but this future self... Su Yu found it displeasing. He didn't like having another version of himself, especially one with intelligence!

Such a thing was like an origin imprint, similar to the Lord of the Undead, potentially possessing its own intelligence, a cunning Su Yu!

He didn't want to be betrayed by himself. That would be a disaster!

In the past, some who practiced the Three Body Method went mad!

The future Su Yu appeared, smiling. "Fellow Daoist..."

He greeted the current Su Yu, but before he could finish, Su Yu punched him. The future self retaliated, but the Human Lord Seal trembled, dispersing the future self's power. Su Yu laughed, grabbing the future self. "Damn it, even the next moment's me doesn't want to be a second me, but the only me... This concept is deeply ingrained! It can't be changed! So this guy might betray me. It's a trap!"

Su Yu continued, "The Three Body Method can be practiced, but don't mess with past and future selves. Just shatter and merge them!"

Wan Tiansheng was speechless. "Your rebellious thoughts are too strong. We've retrieved past and future selves, but none were as rebellious as yours!"

Appearing and immediately wanting to rebel, to kill the original!

This was also Su Yu!

But this thought was deep-rooted. I am unique!

Su Yu wasn't surprised. "It's normal. I don't want another me, so he must think the same. I don't need to guess. This guy is thinking about how to kill me! But the Three Body Method has an advantage: the present is the master! The past and future are secondary!"

He stuffed the future Su Yu into the Human Lord Seal. "Treat it as a power source. When my body is strong enough, I'll shatter him and eat him! No one is allowed to talk to him. I'll seal him to prevent him from persuading you. That would be troublesome!"

Everyone looked at him strangely. It made sense!

The future you would certainly be as persuasive as you.

Just after sealing the future self, Su Yu's aura dissipated. He was prepared and laughed. "I knew it, but didn't expect it so soon. It really is borrowing future power... I summoned the future self, not knowing how long this weakness will last... Now I'm in a weakened state!"

This future self was too close to his current self. Usually, people chose a distant, powerful future, but Su Yu chose the next moment. Su Yu sighed in relief. "Luckily, I sealed my future. Otherwise, if I entered a weakened state and he didn't, he might kill me. Killing myself would be a real grievance!"

"The Three Body Method has serious drawbacks!"

Su Yu walked and talked. "It's best not to merge with the future self! It's too dangerous. First, it might rebel! Second, during a future battle, your power might be drained... Then you're doomed!"

"I only extracted the next moment's future self, but this power dissipation, not knowing how long it will last, is troublesome!"

"I'm even worried that every time I use the future self, I'll have to repay it in a future moment!"

Su Yu spoke gravely. "For example, if my future is the next moment, once I use the future self, I might weaken in the next moment! It will always be like this!"

Su Yu frowned slightly. "This is really bad! If I calculate from when I attacked him, about... one minute after attacking?"

"He only made a few moves... But extracting him causes a weakened period!"

Su Yu calculated quickly. "So now, I'll enter a weakened period, the duration uncertain! Next time, if I merge with the future self, I might fight for 20 minutes, and then weaken for 20 minutes or even longer!"

Wan Tiansheng spoke in a deep voice, "Then why... when we practiced the Three Body Method before, didn't we encounter such drawbacks?"

Su Yu chuckled, "The future you draw upon is often far away, like ten years or a hundred years later. Sometimes, when you suddenly feel weak, you might already have been killed by an enemy! Even if you're not dead, you might not realize it's because of the moment you drew upon your future self! It's quite normal; you might even think you've gone mad from cultivation!"

Upon hearing this, the Great Zhou King was taken aback and said, "There really was such a case! When practicing the Three Body Method, we mentioned there might be some drawbacks, like going mad. Back then, someone suddenly lost all their strength during cultivation and thought they had gone mad. In their panic, they suddenly exploded!"

Su Yu shrugged, "That's normal. If you suddenly find yourself without any strength, you'd be anxious enough to want to end it all. But the explosion... might have been caused by a sudden recovery of strength, leading to a loss of control!"

Shaking his head, Su Yu continued, "So, the future self is extremely unreliable!"

"Not just the future self, the past self is the same!"

Su Yu warned, "Don't practice the Three Body Method. If you do, make sure to destroy it first..."

He paused and then asked, "Do you think the Human Emperor actually knew about this... knew the drawbacks of the Three Body Method were so severe, which is why he didn't let everyone practice it?"

At this, several people nodded. It was indeed possible!

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he suddenly transmitted a message to the Great Zhou King, "Are you sure the Human Emperor is injured and not just in a period of weakness?"

Could it be that the Human Emperor had already drawn upon his past and future powers, and was now in a period of weakness due to the future power draw, causing his strength to spiral out of control?

The Great Zhou King was also taken aback, quickly transmitting back, "He is injured... severely! If it were just a period of weakness as His Majesty described... it should have passed by now. It's possible that during a period of weakness, the Human Emperor's strength spiraled out of control, and he was heavily injured by an opponent. Otherwise, I also find it hard to believe the Human Emperor would be so severely injured!"

Su Yu stroked his chin. That was indeed a possibility.

The Human Emperor was powerful and wouldn't recklessly put himself in danger. He knew the chaos his death would cause. Yet, he was injured, and severely so!

That suggested the Human Emperor might not have anticipated a period of weakness during battle!

Perhaps long ago, the Human Emperor had drawn upon his future self, and many years later, it suddenly erupted, catching even him off guard...

"Tragic!"

Su Yu silently sympathized with the Human Emperor, feeling this was highly likely!

Borrowing power always comes with a price!

The past is certain, but the future is uncertain. To dare borrow future power, Su Yu himself wouldn't dare, so he only borrowed a moment ahead. Look, now he's in a period of weakness.

From a third-tier peak just now, he's now at a fourth or even fifth-tier level.

If he had been in a fierce battle with a strong enemy just now, he would have been killed instantly!

"The Human Emperor must have considered that the future would demand repayment... but when the time comes, it's too late!"

Su Yu quickly said, "Wan Prefect, you can also try merging with the past; it's not too troublesome! The premise is not to choose something too strong, or you'll overwhelm yourself. Merging with the past is feasible! If your physical body is strong enough, you can merge! As for the future, first, you need a carrier, and second, it's full of uncertainties, so it's best not to do it. You also won't easily find a carrier for the ruler of laws..."

Wan Tiansheng said in a deep voice, "But now, it's hard for me to enter the River of Memories. Your Majesty, how should I enter?"

Su Yu smiled, "It's not difficult. When opening the River of Time, keep recalling a specific moment from the past. This River of Memories, I have a general understanding of it. It's essentially a summoning of the origin... During the Sunmoon period, practicing the Three Body Method allows natural entry! After the Sunmoon period, you have to find a way to enter yourself! The Sunmoon realm is passive; beyond Sunmoon, we need to be proactive!"

Su Yu said this with a smile, "Even if you don't merge with the future, merging with a powerful past can greatly enhance your strength! Fourth-tier to third-tier, third-tier to second-tier, it's all possible..."

Of course, it's not easy; the stronger you are, the harder it is to improve!

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry. He first needed to get through the period of weakness. During this time, he would strengthen his physical body, and once the period of weakness passed, he would destroy his future self and see if he could fully achieve second-tier strength!

By then, it would be difficult for Su Yu to improve further!

Next time, he could continue drawing upon the past and future; he hadn't finished yet!

There was still origin power, but next time, the premise was that his physical body was strong enough to serve as a carrier. The Human Lord Seal, if used once, would wear down some power. Using it too many times would damage the Human Lord Seal, which wouldn't be worth it!

After using the Three Body Method once, Su Yu understood it better and said, "The creator of this Three Body Method must have wanted to weaken the power of the River of Time, but this technique... though strange, its benefits aren't necessarily that great, especially drawing upon the future self... it's not a good method. The creator's intentions are uncertain, and they might not be a good person. This situation could easily lead to the downfall of many people!"

Su Yu deeply understood a principle: anything that comes for free must have a price!

The price paid determines the reward.

The past self is the price paid in the past.

The future will also demand repayment in the future!

Su Yu continued, "The power of the past is merely what you left behind in the River of Time; it's about reclaiming what's yours. But the future... is borrowing! It's like overdrawing, consuming in advance!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "So... it's best not to use any future power! That's the safest!"

To be safe, don't use future power at all.

Su Yu had made up his mind. Once he got through the period of weakness, he would find a way to destroy his future self. That thing was not a stable factor.

Moreover, it could easily lead to a split personality!

The few exchanged glances and nodded.

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "No matter what, merging with the past can still make us stronger!"

Su Yu nodded, "That's true, but once you merge with the past... you probably can't be resurrected! Consider it carefully, but the past isn't singular; as long as you don't merge completely, there's still a chance for resurrection!"

He was essentially conducting an experiment for them, and Su Yu didn't mind doing so.

Soon, the group returned to the Upper Realm, back to Su Yu's world.

Next, it was time for everyone to merge with their past selves!

...

Su Yu's period of weakness this time lasted quite a while!

A full half month!

If this had been during a battle... half a month?

You wouldn't even last half a minute!

So, the future self is a huge pitfall!

A super pitfall, and sooner or later, you'll have to pay the debt!

Of course, using it now is satisfying; merging with the future self, turning third-tier into second-tier, is certainly satisfying!

But when it's time to repay, you'll be crying. If you can't repay, you'll be finished.

Su Yu didn't mind; there was nothing happening recently, everything was peaceful, and his world was still expanding, still digesting. With a large number of strong individuals starting to advance, Su Yu easily got through this blank period!

Not only that, but he also strengthened his physical body!

The entire world was being fortified, and Su Yu's own power was actually increasing.

This was also the bonus period after killing Hundred Battle and the others.

During this period, Su Yu was improving, and everyone was improving.

When Su Yu got through the period of weakness, a month had passed since the battle!

By this time, the first year of the New Yu Calendar was almost over!

The year 352 of the Anping Calendar ended, and Su Yu defined 353 as the first year of the New Yu Calendar.

At that time, the Myriad Realms hadn't been completely conquered, but the gods, demons, and immortals had sealed their domains, and Su Yu had conquered the Phoenix and Dragon Realms. Taking advantage of that great victory, Su Yu chose to change the calendar!

Now, the Myriad Realms were completely pacified, the immortals, demons, and gods had withdrawn from the Myriad Realms, Hundred Battle was killed...

Including Su Yu opening the world, breaking the seal, unsealing the Upper and Lower Realms, everything was settled in less than a year. This year was also a year of great harvest for Su Yu!

And all of this happened just four years after Su Yu left Nanyuan.

...

Another month passed. During this month, Su Yu focused on cultivating, strengthening his physical body, preparing to destroy his future self.

He had no interest in keeping the future self around.

At this stage, he didn't want any mishaps to occur within himself.

When he officially entered the second year of the New Yu Calendar, in Su Yu's world, his physical body trembled, and with a punch, he destroyed the future self he had just pulled out from the Human Lord Seal!

Here, the future self had no power to resist.

"Little thing, you still want to fight me?"

Su Yu sneered. The future you fighting the present me was obviously impossible, because the future you was fixed, while the present me was changing every moment. A mere tool, and you want to turn the tables!

Su Yu quickly devoured all the power of this future self!

A lot of power dissipated!

But Su Yu didn't care; if it dissipated, so be it!

At this moment, his physical body trembled, and the world trembled as well. Su Yu knew he was about to fully enter the second tier!

Outside, he was entering the second tier!

Within his world, he might be considered a second-tier peak.

This level of strength was about enough. Further improvement would be extremely difficult, without a great opportunity, Su Yu would find it hard to enter the first tier!

"Enough!"

Su Yu laughed, his physical body trembling, a surge of overwhelming power rising.

In his world, some people, at this moment, taking advantage of Su Yu's moment of advancement, had new insights, and some advanced!

Not just one or two!

At this moment, Su Yu silently savored this feeling, his voice resonating through the world, "Two months have passed, the three-month period is not far! In one month, everyone will gather, those on the list who have not reached the realm of the ruler of laws, I need not say more!"

"In one month, head upstream!"

Su Yu's voice resonated once more!

He had promised three months, and indeed, he had given everyone the full three months without cutting it short. Yet now, two months had already passed!

In just one more month, if the thirty people on the list still couldn't break through... Su Yu would have to fulfill his promise.

...

One month left!

The entire world was abuzz with activity. People were breaking through one after another, but there were also those who were restless and anxious. The deadline of three months was fast approaching!

However, among the thirty people on the list, there were still some who couldn't break through. From being at the forefront initially, they had now failed to break through and were retreating to a secondary position, beginning their retirement. This was not the outcome everyone desired. Even those who wished to avoid battle were not necessarily willing to give up their current paths to others.

This time, Su Yu had been generous, giving everyone three months! Moreover, during these three months, Su Yu himself was also advancing. His progress had actually spurred others to improve and comprehend, making the actual cultivation results quite powerful.

Because Su Yu was also in a period of advancement!

If he had reached his limit, everyone would have to rely solely on themselves to improve. But at this moment, many were leveraging Su Yu's breakthroughs to achieve their own!

Su Yu had officially broken through from the third tier to the second tier!

This was, in fact, a great opportunity!

However, not everyone was Su Yu, and not everyone was extraordinarily gifted.

In the blink of an eye, the final month was nearing its end!

During this period, people continued to break through, yet there were still those who couldn't.

...

In Su Yu's world.

Heavendoom was restless and uneasy!

He was very agitated!

Time was running out, yet he hadn't managed to break through. Not only had he failed to break through, but he had also lost his bamboo pole, and he might even have to give up his current path!

June had broken through before him!

Not only June, but even Giant Bamboo had broken through a few days ago. After all, they had been immersed in the Heavenly King and Heavenly Venerable levels for many years, unlike Heavendoom, who was a latecomer. They had all broken through before him.

The bamboo pole was definitely lost; there was no way around it.

However, if he couldn't become a ruler of laws, he wouldn't even be able to hold onto his current path!

At this moment, Heavendoom was very anxious and frustrated.

He didn't want this!

But his comprehension of the path still hadn't reached that level, and he couldn't control his path of the great cudgel!

"Damn it!"

Heavendoom cursed, wanting to punch the cave in front of him. So annoying!

Was he destined to be abandoned?

Left to guard the second line?

But this wasn't the life he wanted. He wanted to go to the front lines with Su Yu, to the upper reaches, to fight those ancient powerhouses. Back then, he was just an unknown general, not even a titled general!

Now, he wanted to spar with those ancient kings and emperors!

But it seemed he had no chance!

"Most have broken through, why can't I?"

Heavendoom grew increasingly frustrated. The closer it got to the deadline, the less he could calm down.

Just as he was feeling restless, a gentle voice suddenly echoed in his mind: "Calm down! How can you break through when you're so agitated? Sit down, cultivate, and listen to me read to you! Reading more will prevent you from being so frantic at times like this..."

Heavendoom was overjoyed!

Su Yu!

"Thank you, Your Majesty. I knew it, Your Majesty wouldn't forget me..."

Heavendoom was ecstatic. Damn, it turns out being an old hand has its perks; His Majesty is giving me special treatment!

"Don't tell anyone, or everyone will think I'm being unfair..."

"Of course!"

Heavendoom was secretly delighted. Of course, this kind of thing is a secret I must keep to myself. How could I tell anyone else?

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was incredibly busy, instructing Heavendoom while scolding Doubao: "You can do it, stop talking nonsense, hurry up and cultivate. Don't tell anyone I'm giving you special treatment..."

Just after scolding Doubao, he turned angrily to another: "Yingwu, among the ancient marquises, I have the highest hopes for you, even more than Lanshan. You've let me down too much! My path is completely open to you, listen carefully as I impart the essence of the Dao to you... Don't disappoint me again, remember, don't tell others, you're the one I have the most hope for!"

"Lanshan, you fool, Yingwu is about to break through. Her foolish nature annoys me, but I have the highest hopes for you, and yet you haven't broken through..."

"Hou Emperor, your father was the Martial King's mount, and I personally changed your path because I don't want you to become a mount as well... Yet you still can't break through. Fine, if you don't break through soon, you'll have to give up the devouring path! You should know, September and Flatbread are both on the devouring path, but I entrusted the devouring path to you, letting September cultivate the Shattered Space Path and Flatbread the Devouring Origin Path... I have high hopes for you, yet you've let me down so much... I'll explain the devouring path to you one last time. If you still can't do it, then give it up!"

...

At this moment, Su Yu was giving special treatment to those who hadn't broken through yet, telling each of them, "I have the highest hopes for you! You're the one I don't want to give up on! I'm giving you special treatment, something no one else has!"

And these people, evidently, were all instantly invigorated!

His Majesty values me the most!

At this critical moment, he secretly gave me special treatment, and now, those who were excited were no longer in despair!

Indeed, in His Majesty's heart, I am the most trustworthy!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was exhausted!

Teaching the Dao wasn't just about talking; it involved explaining the Dao to others, clarifying it. Sometimes, making complex things simple was still very complicated!

Simplifying the complex!

And Su Yu also discovered that, damn it, the lower the intelligence, the harder it was to break through!

Just look at who breaks through later, and you'll know who has a slightly lower intelligence.

Of course, someone like Giant Axe doesn't count; he was already a Heavenly Venerable and directly became a ruler of laws, so there's nothing to say about that.

The others, the dumber and more reckless ones, broke through more slowly!

This, Su Yu couldn't help.

Without giving special treatment, those reckless ones couldn't break through. Without them, leading a group of smart people on a rescue mission, Su Yu wouldn't feel at ease. He still needed those reckless ones to break through!
