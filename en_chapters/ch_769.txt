Chapter 769: Everyone's Contribution

Although Su Yu had slain the old eagle, no formidable beings had arrived yet. However, he dared not be careless. In the chaos, could there truly be no ancient beasts at the level of a ruler of laws? That was uncertain! Perhaps they hadn't arrived yet, or perhaps they were in slumber, but preparations had to be made.

Boom!

The thunder grew increasingly intense! From all directions, the chaotic forces surged forth, attempting to break through the new world Su Yu was creating. Meanwhile, pages from the Mark of Civilization flew out one by one. He continuously wove the Great Dao, and those powerful beings who had finished their battles took the opportunity to observe, gaining insights and opening their own paths. Creating something from nothing was a sacred act.

At this moment, Su Yu frowned slightly. Weaving the Great Dao was becoming increasingly difficult. Even though he had divided the entire Great Dao into three segments, the second segment, the Myriad Races Dao, was still challenging to integrate, especially the Daos of the powerful races like the gods, immortals, and demons. Their integration caused conflicts with the weaker Daos due to their overwhelming strength.

The power of the Great Dao was slightly imbalanced. Each imbalance was a significant problem.

Just as others had finished slaying the ancient beasts, a sudden explosion echoed. A Great Dao in front of Su Yu shattered, causing him to cough up blood and stagger back a few steps. The other Daos around him trembled violently.

"Your Majesty!"

The Great Zhou King and others were alarmed! They had anticipated that Su Yu might make mistakes, but when it actually happened, they were still anxious. What should they do now?

Su Yu closed his eyes, saying nothing as he quickly stabilized the other Daos. The error was in the sequence; the Dao he had just integrated was incorrect. It wasn't a power imbalance but a sequencing error. The previously integrated Dao was incompatible with the current one.

This wasn't the main issue, nor was it the biggest problem. The biggest problem was that the rupture of this Dao would prevent subsequent Daos from integrating, causing the entire sequence to be incorrect.

Out of three thousand pages, Su Yu had only integrated about a thousand, a third of the total. This meant that the remaining two-thirds of the Daos might not be able to connect.

In the Land of the Abyss, others hadn't yet grasped the situation, thinking the rupture was the biggest problem. But seeing Su Yu stabilize the Daos, they all breathed a sigh of relief. However, at this moment, some people's expressions changed.

Those students of the Culture King, like Bai Feng and Hetu, all had their expressions shift.

Trouble!

The deduction had still gone wrong. The time was too short, and now that Su Yu had broken a Dao, missing one or two Daos wasn't the issue. The key was how to connect the subsequent ones.

This problem had been considered before, and preparatory plans had been made. However, none of the solutions were perfect.

The female death spirit beside Hetu shouted, "Don't rashly attempt to integrate the next Dao. With one broken, the entire sequence needs to change!"

With that, she rushed over, shouting, "Let us reorganize. We prepared some plans before. Give us three days, and we'll help you select the next Great Dao power..."

The remaining Daos all needed to be re-evaluated to select the most compatible Great Dao power.

...

Su Yu looked at the Great Dao before him, frowning slightly.

Three days? Who knew what might emerge from the chaos in three days? Moreover, he might not be able to maintain the stability of this Great Dao for that long.

"Forget it!"

Su Yu responded calmly, "If it doesn't work, I'll close it with these thousand Great Dao powers. It will be weaker than expected, but still acceptable!"

Connecting them was indeed challenging. Su Yu had made some estimates himself. If a Dao truly broke and couldn't be connected, he would have to close it with the current number of Great Dao powers.

This would result in a weaker path. His creation of the heavens wasn't very strong to begin with. Now, with only a third of the Daos closed, he might not even achieve the level of a Heavenly King. Could he even become a top-tier Daofuse?

It was hard to accept, but Su Yu felt it wouldn't be a major issue.

He hoped for success!

At this moment, Lantian rushed back, smiling brightly. "Where did it break?"

Su Yu looked up at Lantian, who wore a radiant smile. At this moment, Lantian maintained the appearance of Zhao Ming, whom Su Yu had known. Lantian's smile was as carefree as ever, a bit roguish, as he chuckled, "Come on, where did it break? Don't waste time waiting for the chaotic beings to attack!"

The student of the Culture King also moved slightly, looking at Su Yu and saying solemnly, "I think... you should let him try!"

Su Yu looked at Lantian, who chuckled, "I won't die. With my avatars, it's hard for me to die! When did you become so hesitant?"

He remembered the time when he burned his lifespan. Friends were few and should be cherished.

Su Yu closed his eyes. In the distance, Wan Tiansheng showed a hint of struggle in his eyes, quickly shouting, "Stop wasting time. Let Lantian try first. Tell him where it broke!"

Su Yu opened his eyes, clear and bright, looking at Lantian and smiling, "It broke at the Invisibility Dao. The Invisibility Dao was supposed to connect with the Shadow Dao, but the Shadow Dao broke..."

Lantian laughed, "It broke there? Strange, we considered possible breakpoints before, but didn't expect it to break here. These two Daos are quite similar, aren't they?"

He couldn't figure it out, but there was no need to dwell on it.

In the next moment, dozens of avatars appeared around him, each wearing a smile. "Invisibility Dao... if the Shadow Dao broke, which Dao do you think would be more suitable?"

Su Yu remained silent. He wasn't sure and couldn't judge.

Lantian chuckled, "Forget it, I'll think about it myself..."

He pondered for a moment, and soon, an avatar appeared, followed by another. One represented the Invisibility Dao, and the other was his chosen Dao. "Invisibility, a rather strong Dao, concealing one's presence. I'll try connecting it with the Concealment Dao..."

He quickly fused the two avatars, and the next moment, they exploded!

Lantian swiftly protected the Invisibility Dao avatar, while the other exploded. He didn't mind and continued, "Still not right. If both Shadow and Concealment are wrong, perhaps the problem lies with the Invisibility Dao itself... otherwise, the compatibility should be high!"

He was puzzled, and the female death spirit who had arrived also frowned, quickly saying, "Invisibility... although it's called Invisibility, it might just be an optical illusion. Try the Light Dao..."

"Alright!"

Lantian quickly attempted, but the result was another explosion.

Still wrong!

Lantian frowned, trying five or six more avatars, but they all exploded. None were correct.

Now, Lantian was also anxious.

Why were none of them right?

Meanwhile, Su Yu gradually calmed down. If none were correct, perhaps the Invisibility Dao was indeed difficult to match. Where was the problem?

If Lantian hadn't tried seven or eight times, and Su Yu had tried and chosen himself, the Great Dao might have collapsed by now.

At this moment, in the distance, Doubao suddenly said, "Invisibility... is invisibility an illusion? Like me, when I think I'm invisible, everyone thinks I'm invisible... a kind of willpower interference? Rather than the body truly disappearing?"

As soon as these words were spoken, Su Yu's eyes moved slightly.

Sometimes, people tend to overthink.

Doubao might not be very smart, but it remembered what Su Yu had told it before. Its Time Dao was just a kind of willpower interference. Could the Invisibility Dao be the same?

If so, then aligning with invisibility would naturally lead to errors.

Su Yu and the others had named this Dao the Invisibility Dao, but perhaps the name itself was a mistake.

Lantian's eyes also lit up, "Don't say, it might really be possible! If it's willpower interference... then our fusion was wrong, and the positioning was wrong!"

In the next moment, he smiled, "Why not try a Great Dao power related to willpower interference!"

Without waiting for Su Yu's response, he fused another avatar.

This time, there was no explosion, and Lantian's eyes lit up with joy, "Try connecting with the Illusion Dao!"

Su Yu waited for a while and quickly began connecting.

Sure enough, this time, the newly born Great Dao integrated without rejection.

However, the subsequent process was still troublesome. The order of the remaining Daos might need to be changed.

The female death spirit, seeing this, quickly said, "Lantian, continue. Follow the previous Great Dao order. After the Illusion Dao, continue integrating according to the original sequence... we'll see how to arrange the disconnected Daos in between!"

Lantian didn't say much. Su Yu's Great Dao sequence was known to them, and they had personally devised it.

At this moment, he quickly said, "Follow me. If I encounter a problem with the fusion, don't try again!"

Su Yu silently nodded.

Lantian swiftly followed his sequence, integrating the avatars one by one. He was fast, just setting an example for Su Yu, not intending to fuse all the Daos himself.

Subsequently, it went smoothly.

After the Illusion Dao, he integrated five or six avatars in succession. With a loud explosion, another avatar shattered, indicating another fusion error.

Of course, this didn't hinder Su Yu, as he hadn't reached that point yet.

Lantian frowned, and the other death spirits, including Bai Feng, Wan Tiansheng, and the Great Zhou King, quickly gathered.

"Your Majesty, continue fusing the Daos!"

The Great Zhou King shouted, and several people quickly surrounded Lantian, devising a new connection plan.

...

Su Yu silently opened the path.

Lantian had tried once, and there shouldn't be any major issues. As for the explosion in the middle, by the time he reached that point, it might have been resolved.

Lantian had initially said he wanted to help Su Yu try once, but Su Yu had refused.

Now, he could only let Lantian help him test.

Su Yu continued opening the path, while a group of people quickly discussed. Soon, Lantian began trying again. This time, another explosion occurred, just like before, with the Great Dao rejecting.

Lantian tried seven or eight times in a row, all ending in failure.

In the Land of the Abyss, the Southern King stood silently, observing the scene before her. After a long while, she sighed softly, "Lanshan, do you think cultivation is better pursued alone, or should it be a collective effort?"

"Collective effort?" Marquis Lanshan was puzzled. "Isn't cultivation something one does alone?"

The Southern King glanced towards Su Yu's direction and spoke softly, "Is it? Then what about now? Do you think he's cultivating alone?"

Marquis Lanshan also looked over, momentarily at a loss for words. Was Su Yu still opening the heavens by himself? Perhaps not.

There were those who paved the way for him, acting as true pioneers for the king. They attempted to fuse the Dao first, while others quickly discussed and strategized on how to make Su Yu's fusion of the Dao more successful. If Su Yu were alone, he might have failed after a few attempts.

What exactly is cultivation? At this moment, Marquis Lanshan found the topic too profound to grasp. She couldn't help but ask, "Back then, when the Martial King and others cultivated, they relied on themselves. Southern King, which do you think is better?"

The Southern King shook her head, unable to provide an answer. However, after a while, she smiled and said, "I don't know which is better... but don't you feel that when he opens the Dao, it's as if everyone is involved? There's a sense of... participation?"

Participation? The Southern King actually wanted to say that it brought a greater sense of belonging. Look, even our emperor needs us to open a Dao. He truly is still a child.

Marquis Lanshan chuckled, "Indeed, when His Majesty opens the Dao, I feel like I'm opening it too! But it seems we aren't really involved. I envy Lantian and the others, who can directly decide how His Majesty opens the Dao."

At this moment, the feeling was palpable. Seeing her envy, the Southern King smiled and transmitted her voice, "Do you want to be involved?"

"Of course!" Marquis Lanshan nodded, tilting her head to look at her. "Does the Southern King also analyze the Great Dao?"

We're not suited for this. The Southern King didn't seem to have much insight into the Great Dao either.

The Southern King remained silent for a while before transmitting her voice again, "If you want to be involved, there's still a chance! His paths of life and death have not been opened. He probably doesn't have a deep understanding of the path of life and death, or perhaps he isn't confident in completing it..."

"Especially the path of death, which might be the hardest to open!"

Marquis Lanshan seemed to understand something and transmitted her voice, "What do you mean? How can we help him?"

The Southern King hesitated before transmitting her voice again, "Transitioning from life to death isn't difficult. The challenge is transitioning from death to life! Hetu might demonstrate the process of transforming life into death... but how to revive?"

"Back then, the Culture King wanted to resurrect someone but failed repeatedly. Once dead, how can one come back to life?"

"If he opens myriad Daos without involving life and death, it might not be as difficult... but since he wants to open different Daos, including life and death, it becomes challenging. Yet, without opening life and death... his Dao won't be complete!"

Su Yu also wanted to avoid opening life and death, but without it, how could his Dao be perfect? Without a core foundation, he was bound to fail in opening the heavens!

Even if the Southern King wasn't entirely clear, she knew Su Yu was forced to make this choice.

"From death to life..." Marquis Lanshan murmured. Yes, how does one transition from death to life? It was indeed challenging!

Wan Tiansheng seemed to have attempted it once, but he relied on the power of the River of Time. Su Yu, however, had not connected to the River of Time.

"Does the Southern King have a way?"

The Southern King had lived for a long time, and she had interacted with the Culture King during her time in the Death Realm, especially when the Culture King was considering how to revive Xingyue.

The Southern King pondered for a while before transmitting her voice again, "After all, he isn't truly dead; he's merely opening the path of death. Even if he opens the path of the dead, it won't be too powerful. You and I are both strong in the path of the dead... If he fails to open the path of death... he might not die, but this attempt to open the heavens will likely fail completely!"

Marquis Lanshan was anxious, "Do you have a way or not?"

Why was the Southern King rambling? If Su Yu failed to open the Dao, he might not die, but all his accumulated efforts would be wasted. There might not be another chance!

Of course, if he truly failed, Su Yu might inherit the pen dao? Settle for being the second generation of the pen dao?

Marquis Lanshan thought to herself and suddenly wanted to laugh. Indeed, even if Su Yu failed, he might not be completely ruined. There was no need to worry too much.

However... she still hoped Su Yu would succeed. If he failed this time, he might not have a second chance in his lifetime. Time was running out, and opportunities might not always be there, limiting Su Yu's achievements.

Being the master of rules might be their dream, but clearly, that wasn't the limit of Su Yu's dreams.

The Southern King quickly transmitted her voice, "If he truly fails, you and I will extract the power of the rules from the path of the dead!"

Marquis Lanshan listened quietly, waiting for the Southern King's explanation.

The Southern King swiftly said, "I know a place they call the Intersection of Life and Death, located at the end of the path of the dead! It's where the paths of life and death converge... Find Liu Hong, and through his Ink Dao, we can extract the power of the path of the dead and draw the power of life and death from the intersection into his Dao..."

Marquis Lanshan was surprised and transmitted her voice, "Is that possible? Then... why doesn't His Majesty do it?"

The Southern King was exasperated, "Nonsense! How can he do it? He's opening the Dao in the Land of Chaos, while the end of the path of the dead is in the Death Realm. It's inherently contradictory; he can't manage both!"

Marquis Lanshan's mind wasn't always sharp, not that the Southern King looked down on her, but sometimes she really wasn't quick-witted!

If Su Yu could manage both, would he need you to say anything? It's precisely because he can't that there's no way.

The Southern King continued, "You and I have strong power in the path of the dead. When the time comes, I'll take you to the Intersection of Life and Death. Together, we'll expend our strength to construct a channel from the path of the dead... a conduit to draw the power of life and death into his Dao!"

"Can it be done?"

"It can, but we'll need help, and Liu Hong's assistance is crucial, using his Ink Dao..."

The Southern King looked around. Liu Hong seemed to be here, but he was keeping a low profile, and she didn't know where he had gone.

After searching for a while, she finally spotted Liu Hong hiding behind Xia Chen, doing something unknown.

Without further ado, the Southern King swiftly approached and grabbed Liu Hong from behind Xia Chen.

Liu Hong looked bewildered. What was going on?

At that moment, he was scribbling and calculating something, unaware of what was happening.

The Southern King grabbed him by the neck, not giving him a chance to speak, and quickly dragged him outside. Marquis Lanshan followed closely.

Liu Hong was confused, "What is it, seniors? I haven't offended you, have I?"

Why drag me here out of nowhere? Strange!

The Southern King couldn't be bothered with small talk and quickly transmitted her voice, "Can you control your Ink Dao?"

"This..."

"Less nonsense. I'm asking if you can use the Ink Dao to connect the Intersection of Life and Death and create a channel to draw the power of life and death into the Land of Chaos?"

Liu Hong was taken aback, "Were you spying on me?"

"What?"

"I was just calculating that!"

Liu Hong hurriedly said, "I was calculating the chances of success, but so far, the prospects look bleak! The Intersection of Life and Death is still some distance from my Ink Dao. To draw the power, we must first suppress the willpower domains of the strong in the river! Then, we need to open a separate channel... and then infuse the power into my Ink Dao, after which we can try to introduce it into the Land of Chaos..."

It required several steps.

The Southern King transmitted her voice, "What if Lanshan and I help?"

"You two?"

Liu Hong thought for a moment, "Not enough, we need one more, preferably a strong practitioner of the path of life. But doing so would be dangerous for all of you! Let me put it this way: drawing the power of life and death, you are dead spirits and will be corroded by the power of life, while the living will be corroded by the aura of death!"

"My Ink Dao isn't much of a problem because I'm half-dead... but this requires top-tier experts, and top-tier experts can't transform into half-dead spirits... Even if you two agree, we still need a strong practitioner of the power of life!"

"The power of life?"

The Southern King frowned, "We have no one who practices the power of life!"

She quickly added, "Can't it be done without a practitioner of the power of life?"

"No!"

"Even if you're willing... your aura of death is too strong, easily causing an imbalance between life and death. This isn't a problem that can be solved by risking your lives."

Liu Hong, who mastered the Ink Dao, was quite knowledgeable about these matters.

After thinking for a moment, he looked around and transmitted his voice, "Actually... there is a suitable candidate, but I don't know if they're willing."

"Who?"

"If no one practices the path of life, then we need a top-tier expert with abundant vitality! Preferably a human, as being of the same race would prevent any imbalance in the power of life and death..."

Liu Hong quickly suggested, "If both the South King and Marquis Lanshan have no objections, here's my proposal: the South King should suppress the wills of the powerful beings within the Great Dao, while Marquis Lanshan opens a passage, creating a path of death to channel the power of death. Meanwhile, another person, someone with strength comparable to Marquis Lanshan, should channel the power of life."

The South King, impatient, asked, "Just say it, who is suitable?"

"The Great Zhou King!"

The South King was slightly taken aback. Liu Hong explained, "Wan Tiansheng and Lantian aren't suitable; they've lived too short a time. Simply put, the power of life is like a great tree—the longer it lives, the more abundant its life force. However, it can't be too old either. For instance, Marquis Dingjun and others, their vitality seems lacking, including Consort Qi. But the Great Zhou King... he's old yet youthful!"

What kind of statement was that?

Both the South King and Marquis Lanshan were speechless. This statement... it didn't sound quite right.

Liu Hong explained again, "Truly, the Great Zhou King may be old, but his vitality is incredibly strong. I suspect he has consumed some kind of supreme treasure, making his life force extraordinarily robust!"

That was indeed true.

The South King pondered for a moment, about to say something when Marquis Lanshan interjected, "Could it be the Longevity Pill? I remember that back then, the Culture King killed a supreme expert of the Immortal Race and crafted three Longevity Pills, which were presented to the Human Emperor. After that, there was no news... This old fellow was the Human Emperor's scribe; could it be that the Human Emperor gifted him one?"

Liu Hong shrugged, "I wouldn't know about that."

He only knew that the Great Zhou King could definitely live, perhaps not shorter than the rulers of laws. Even if everyone else died, he might not.

At this moment, Marquis Lanshan and the South King exchanged a glance, both showing a hint of solemnity.

The Great Zhou King... was indeed a tricky subject.

To say the Great Zhou King was Su Yu's direct subordinate wasn't quite accurate. He was merely responsible for passing the torch for the Human Emperor, yet he was the most suitable. Others were either too weak or lacked sufficient vitality.

Marquis Lanshan thought for a moment, "Why not ask him? If he's unwilling, then forget it..."

Channeling the power of life and death was also in preparation for Su Yu.

Currently, Su Yu was fusing Daos rapidly.

With Lantian's help, some troubles were eliminated, and Su Yu's speed in fusing Daos was much faster than before.

The South King also said, "We must prepare in advance. Even if he succeeds... it's best to be ready! Otherwise, if we wait until the last moment, it might be too late! While he's still fusing Daos, we should open the path. At a critical moment, we can channel the power of life and death through the Great Dao!"

Marquis Lanshan nodded, looking towards the distant Great Zhou King, and suddenly transmitted, "That guy who docked my rations, come over here!"

In the distance, the Great Zhou King was discussing subsequent plans with others. Hearing this, he was slightly stunned, feeling somewhat helpless.

Who docked your rations?

This woman, even in death, held grudges!

Helplessly, he quickly flew over.

Marquis Lanshan was a bit embarrassed but still asked, "Are you afraid of death?"

"......"

"Did you take the Longevity Pill?"

"Yes!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, not denying it, and smiled, "Does Marquis Lanshan want one too? But this thing can only be consumed by the living, and besides, all three Longevity Pills have been used up."

"All used up?"

Marquis Lanshan didn't care who used the other two. She quickly said, "His Majesty is opening the path of life and death, and there might be trouble! The South King and I discussed it, and we need someone with strong life force to assist... Are you in or not? If not, forget it!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was slightly distracted. After a moment, he said, "You all... if he succeeds in opening it himself, he won't need the assistance of life and death power!"

"What if he fails?"

Marquis Lanshan, though feeling that saying this was demoralizing, continued, "Stop wasting words. If you're not in, we'll find someone else..."

The Great Zhou King chuckled, speaking softly, "Have you all considered this? Actually, I've thought about it, and not just me. Do you think others don't know this? If not others, Wan Tiansheng and Lantian must have considered it! But it's very difficult, and the risk is high! For the living, it's not too bad, but for the dead... if you die, you're truly dead!"

"If Emperor Yu fails, at worst, he loses his path. If the dead fail, it's completely over!"

"Moreover, it requires top-tier experts! In the entire Death Realm, if anyone is suitable... it might really only be you two!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Even Emperor Yu himself knows this, but he hasn't spoken up or mentioned it! Actually, we know his thoughts. At worst, if he fails, he can inherit the pen dao! He might not inherit the Human Emperor's path, but he is willing to inherit the pen dao... So, if he fails, he has a fallback. If you fail to channel, you might completely perish!"

Marquis Lanshan was slightly stunned, "His Majesty knows too?"

"Of course!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "You wouldn't think Emperor Yu is so foolish, would you? He's been to the intersection of life and death. You know because he told you. Things you both have considered, how could he not be aware?"

He just didn't mention it!

Marquis Lanshan glanced towards Su Yu. At this moment, Su Yu was about to open 2,000 paths. Su Yu himself had about 3,000 pages, and at this rate, he would soon need to open the path of life and death.

She asked, "If we fail to channel, we'll die. What counts as failure?"

"If problems arise midway, that's naturally a failure..."

The Great Zhou King sighed, "The path of death is not a weak path. Opening a sealed passage within it requires two strong beings of life and death, working together to maintain the balance and continuously channel it out..."

He looked at Liu Hong, "You're probably thinking of using Liu Hong's Ink Dao, right?"

"In that case, the safety is indeed higher. Liu Hong as the node, staying in the Land of the Abyss, channeling it to Emperor Yu's side is indeed much simpler!"

At this, the Great Zhou King added, "However, there can be no mistakes during the process. If the South King chooses to suppress the wills of the strong in the path of death, there will inevitably be conflicts with some strong beings... it's extremely dangerous!"

Marquis Lanshan frowned, "I'm not afraid! I've died once already! South King... South King, are you afraid?"

The South King chuckled, "Don't forget, I was the one who reminded you!"

Alright!

Marquis Lanshan looked at the Great Zhou King again, "You talk a lot. Just tell me if you're in or not. Saying so much, are you scared? If so, forget it, we'll ask someone else..."

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Marquis Lanshan still has that fiery temper! I didn't say no! Besides, apart from me, others might not be suitable!"

"You agreed?"

Marquis Lanshan was surprised. This old fellow, the Great Zhou King, actually agreed?

The Great Zhou King smiled, "I said, for me, the danger isn't that great! However, I have one condition... whatever I say goes. Whatever I say to do, that's what we do. Otherwise... I don't want to die with idiots!"

Who was he referring to?

Marquis Lanshan looked at Liu Hong, who wore an innocent smile.

Then she looked at the South King, who remained expressionless and aloof.

She looked back at the Great Zhou King, her expression turning sour, "Are you talking about me?"

Is it me you're talking about?

The Great Zhou King laughed, transmitting, "No, don't misunderstand, I was talking about Liu Hong, right?"

He glanced at Liu Hong, who nodded with a smile.

I admit it!

Everyone understood without saying.

The Great Zhou King didn't bother to say more, glancing at Lantian and the others in the distance, quickly transmitting, "If you agree, listen to me completely, then we have a chance of success. The problem won't be too big, but if you don't listen... you might die!"

"Listen to you!"

Marquis Lanshan muttered, "Don't worry! I know you cunning guys, always full of tricks! Back then, when I acted with the Martial King, I listened to all of you!"

"The lord went out to destroy realms, always consulting the silk pouch, everything arranged, I understand this!"

Just a habit!

Isn't it just following orders?

No problem!

Back then, the Martial King was so strong, yet when he went to war, he still consulted the silk pouch every day. If it wasn't from the Culture King, it was from someone else, all arranged for him. The Martial King himself was too lazy to think, too tired to ponder.

Life is short, just enjoy it, why be so tired?

The Great Zhou King was amused, well, it went smoother than expected.

He didn't say more, quickly transmitting, "That's good, I'll go borrow the Starry Sky Seal, and we'll prepare at the intersection of life and death. You're right, it's better to be prepared than not!"

"Borrow it... won't His Majesty know?"

"Of course!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "We must tell him, otherwise... what if he gives up midway? He's a decisive person, might just give up if he feels it's not right, and if communication fails, it'll be troublesome!"

With that, he chuckled, "No worries, at this point, he's been pushed onto the stage! We need to give him a push, let him feel more pressure, let him know that his failure isn't just his own business!"

Marquis Lanshan nodded slightly.

And the Great Zhou King quickly headed towards the Land of Chaos.

...

Moments later, Su Yu's expression wasn't good. He was still opening paths, having opened over 2,000 now.

He was not far from the last few hundred.

At that time, he must connect life and death.

"Did you force Lanshan and the others?"

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King, who was helpless. What was he saying?

"No, they forced me!"

Su Yu snorted, do I believe that?

"Lanshan and the others might not have thought of this. Did you deliberately guide them?"

He was suspicious that the Great Zhou King had secretly instigated it.

The Great Zhou King felt wronged this time, damn it, it wasn't me!

It was Marquis Lanshan who approached me!

Where could I go to argue this?

This... was too unjust!

"Your Majesty, I'm wronged!"

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, "It really wasn't me... forget it, just assume it was me!"

"Your Majesty, whether you borrow the Starry Sky Seal or not, we've decided to give it a try... not borrowing it is even more dangerous!"

Su Yu took a deep breath. "If I fail, I'll just settle down and stop thinking about opening the Great Dao. It's not a big deal, just inheriting the pen dao. Even though the pen dao is trash, I still have hope! There's no need to risk lives for a single attempt at opening the Dao, you know?"

The pen dao might be a bit trashy, but... it could still be used, albeit reluctantly! Su Yu didn't have to succeed in opening the Dao. Success would just mean becoming a Heavenly Sovereign or even a master of the power of laws more quickly.

If the Culture King had heard this, who knows what he would think. So, in Su Yu's eyes, inheriting the pen dao was trash?

The Great Zhou King chuckled. "Your Majesty, it's different! At the very least, we hope you succeed. Only with your success do we have hope for victory! Otherwise, even if the pen dao becomes a master of the power of laws, it might not have any advantage in the upcoming changes!"

"The sacrifices we make now are to reduce the sacrifices we might have to make in the future!"

"If we fail to open the Dao now, we might pay an even greater price in the future!"

Su Yu was silent for a moment before a large seal flew out. "Go! Be careful!"

After speaking, Su Yu said solemnly, "If things become impossible, then retreat! And... if I truly fail... if the pen dao has no hope... then I... then I'll go inherit the Human Emperor's Dao!"

The Great Zhou King was slightly shaken. Su Yu continued in a deep voice, "It's no big deal, but you mustn't deliberately sabotage me. Otherwise... I won't let you off! Remember, if things go wrong and people might die, then give up!"

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath. "Alright, I understand! Rest assured, Your Majesty, I hope... you become the second emperor, not the second Human Emperor!"

Soon, the Great Zhou King left with a few others.

At this moment, Su Yu's emotions were complex. Lantian, the Great Zhou King, the South King... all these people were responsible for his attempt to open the Great Dao. If he failed this time, he would truly let them down.

I will succeed! Definitely! Even if I have to reverse life and death, I will succeed! Never before had his conviction been stronger.

"Pen dao... I don't want it, it's trash!"

"Human Emperor's Great Dao, the Human Emperor has returned, let him cultivate it himself. I can't be bothered to help him!"

PS: Stop urging, I'll finish opening the Great Dao today, poor thing!
