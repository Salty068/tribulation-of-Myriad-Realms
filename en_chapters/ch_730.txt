Chapter 730: Rewards and Recognition

"Emperor Yu!"

"Your Majesty!"

When Su Yu once again arrived at the eighth floor, a group of people greeted him with excitement, their gains substantial.

Su Yu glanced around, his gaze landing on the Radiant King's Residence within the Four Kings' Residences. He raised an eyebrow slightly, "The Great Ming King hasn't come out?"

"No," the Great Zhou King quickly replied. "I went to check, but there's a formation sealing the Radiant King's Residence, and I couldn't enter."

Su Yu stepped into the air, swiftly flying towards the Radiant King's Residence. At this moment, a grand formation rose outside the residence. Su Yu raised an eyebrow, reaching out with his hand. The Human Lord Seal descended from the void, and Su Yu carefully sensed it. The area of the Great Ming Prefecture within the seal was rich with the power of fortune, providing a substantial amount of fortune power to Su Yu's Human Lord Seal.

After sensing it for a moment, Su Yu smiled, "It seems he has found an opportunity. Well, everyone has their own fortunes. The Radiant King is his ancestor, so there shouldn't be any issues!"

With that, Su Yu spoke, "Let's go back first. The Martial Emperor has opened the path, and Tongtian can teleport us to the eighth floor at any time, so there's no need to wait here."

He had other matters to attend to and needed to head to the Upper Realm soon. Who knew when a battle might break out there? If he didn't go, he wouldn't have first-hand information, and that made Su Yu uneasy.

The Great Zhou King was somewhat surprised, "The Martial Emperor opened the path? Does Emperor Yu mean..."

"Yes, using the path to allow Tongtian's power to penetrate the Luminous Domain Mansion. After all, it's his own body, so he can still control it."

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath. How did you manage that? Wasn't it said that the Martial Emperor harbored immense resentment towards the Human Race? Why would he listen to you?

The other ancient marquises were also surprised and shocked. Is this even possible?

Su Yu didn't explain further and quickly said, "Tongtian Marquis, can you teleport us out?"

Tongtian Marquis quickly sensed and nodded, "I think I can. I seem to be able to sense the power from the outside world now! However, the eighth floor doesn't connect to the outside world directly; we'll have to pass through the Death Realm as a transit point. Later, I'll see if I can directly teleport to the Myriad Realms."

At this moment, he could feel the power of death. After all, the seventh floor had a passage to the Death Realm.

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "Then let's go through the Death Realm first."

Tongtian Marquis didn't say much more, quickly transforming into a portal. The portal gradually opened, and on the other side, a shadowy projection appeared, resembling the Death Realm.

...

Moments later, Su Yu and his group stepped into the portal. With a wave of power, they instantly appeared in the Death Realm. As they appeared, the aura of living beings stirred, causing the Celestial River of Death to ripple.

Lantian waved his hand, spreading death energy to conceal the aura of life. Su Yu also let the Human Lord Seal float in the air to mask their presence, preventing any disturbance to the Celestial River of Death, where many powerful death spirits had recently emerged.

They had just landed when waves of powerful death spirit auras approached. Marquis Dingjun and the others were quite tense. This was the Death Realm, after all. Although Su Yu had previously said this was his territory, still...

Before they could finish their thoughts, from a distance, Marquis Lanshan's excited voice rang out, "Your Majesty!"

Marquis Lanshan moved swiftly, appearing in a flash, kneeling on one knee with great excitement, "Greetings, Your Majesty! When did you return?"

"Lanshan?" someone exclaimed in surprise. Marquis Lanshan looked up, recognizing the person, and was also delighted, "Yingwu? You're still alive?"

General Yingwu was equally pleased, "I heard you were in the Death Realm before, and I thought..."

Marquis Lanshan's dark face showed joy, "It's been years, Yingwu. Are you following His Majesty now too?"

"..." General Yingwu was speechless. You meet me and immediately talk about this? How boring.

Marquis Lanshan didn't care about that and joyfully said, "Congratulations to Your Majesty for gaining another warrior! Yingwu was a fierce general back in the day, but due to unfortunate circumstances, she couldn't step into the Daofuse Realm and thus wasn't conferred as a marquis. If she had died like me, she could have been posthumously conferred!"

"..." This sounded wrong. So, Yingwu couldn't be conferred as a marquis while alive but could be posthumously conferred if dead?

General Yingwu was also depressed, "Lanshan, why bring up the past?"

Marquis Lanshan laughed, "No, I must tell His Majesty. Your Majesty, Yingwu was a valiant warrior back then, yet she couldn't be conferred as a marquis! If Your Majesty regains control of the Myriad Realms, and Yingwu contributes, please grant her a marquis title to fulfill her dream!"

Su Yu chuckled, "It's only been a few days since we last met, and you're already asking for a title for someone else?"

Marquis Lanshan was excited, "I just saw an old friend and got a bit emotional! Although we weren't in the same battalion, Yingwu was a fierce warrior, and the Yingwu Guards and Lanshan Guards were almost equally famous back then. I'm genuinely happy!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Alright, for your sake, if General Yingwu contributes in the future, she won't be denied a marquis title!"

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Marquis Lanshan was delighted, looking at General Yingwu, who was a bit confused but quickly said, "Thank you, Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu smiled and didn't say much more.

Marquis Lanshan glanced at the others but didn't say anything. After all, she wasn't familiar with them. Despite being ancient powerhouses, not everyone knew each other.

She wasn't too familiar, but soon, several other death spirit marquises arrived. Marquis Zhengyang and others were familiar with Marquis Huoyun and his group. Soon, these old acquaintances were chatting away.

Ahead, Su Yu was quickly conversing with Marquis Lanshan and Hetu.

...

Hetu wasn't interested in those old relics. At this moment, he was excited about something else and quickly said, "Your Majesty, we might have found some of the Culture King's students! However, they have just awakened and aren't very clear-headed, similar to the previous dazed ones. They probably awakened due to the recent disturbances in the Celestial River of Death!"

He hurriedly added, "Once they stabilize their minds and cultivate for a while, they should recover many memories."

Su Yu nodded, "It's good that you've found them! These people must be well protected."

Su Yu valued the Culture King's students highly and was in a good mood. "These people can even split the pen dao, and their understanding of the Great Dao is not weak. They will be of great help to me in proving the Dao! In this era, there are too few people dedicated to research!"

Su Yu indeed valued the Culture King's students. Their strength didn't matter; what mattered was their brains!

He needed to merge the myriad daos next, which was no small feat. Last time, he and Lantian studied the Chaos Dao, and many components hadn't been split or decomposed.

This required time and understanding of the Great Dao. Su Yu didn't have the time to focus on research. If he could bring out these students or even revive them, it would undoubtedly help him open his own path.

After chatting for a while, the South King sensed Su Yu's presence and quickly arrived. The South King was much prouder than Marquis Lanshan. She glanced at Yingwu and the others, barely looking at them, her face cold. She quickly approached Su Yu and began discussing the Upper Realm.

...

"South Heavenly King!"

At this moment, several ancient powerhouses were secretly communicating. Yingwu was displeased, transmitting, "This guy is so arrogant, seeing us with a dark face."

"His face is naturally dark!" Marquis Dingjun transmitted, quickly adding with a laugh, "He's strong, and his status is high. Among the four Heavenly Kings of the Death Realm, he's on par with the Human King! We're a level lower than him! Don't complain; you're two levels lower, just a titled general. Why would he bother with you?"

This left Yingwu speechless. Marquis Dingjun continued, "Didn't you hear? When the Myriad Realms are unified again, I can be conferred as a marquis!"

"Even if you're conferred as a marquis, you'll still be a level lower than the South Heavenly King!"

Marquis Dingjun continued to poke at her, leaving Yingwu frustrated but helpless because it was the truth.

Feeling a bit depressed, Shadow Marquis didn't comment on this but transmitted, "I didn't expect the new Human Lord to actually take control of the Death Realm! In the past few tides, no one dared to walk so recklessly here!"

A group of living people walking so brazenly in the Death Realm was a first in ten thousand years.

The others didn't say much, but they were all aware and shocked. Fortunately, Su Yu had killed eight Heavenly Kings at once, so they could handle it.

Yunshui Marquis glanced at Yingwu again. The others did too. Didn't you say the new Human Lord was in a miserable state? A puppet? Look at how these death spirit powerhouses are flocking to him!

Whether it was the South King or Marquis Lanshan, they dared not overstep, following Su Yu's lead. Even the proud South Heavenly King maintained decorum before Su Yu.

Yingwu was speechless again. What are you looking at? How was I supposed to know it would turn out like this?

...

"How is the Land of the Abyss?"

At this moment, Su Yu ignored the others and looked at the South King. The South King quickly replied, "Chaotic! Recently, the North King seems to have had conflicts with some sealed powerhouses in the Land of the Abyss. Those sealed beings have controlled a group of people and are fighting against the North King's subordinates!"

"Some powerhouses revived from the Celestial River of Death have also been driven to the Land of the Abyss and are participating in the battle."

The South King said seriously, "I must mention something! Under the North King, Marquis Dragonblood is highly valued. In several battles, Marquis Dragonblood has led the North King's forces, and his strength is growing. The Land of the Abyss has already seen the fall of five or six death spirit marquises!"

The South King added, "Marquis Dragonblood's current strength, I fear, is not weaker than Marquis Lanshan. If this continues, I suspect he might become the next Heavenly King powerhouse!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "His strength is improving so quickly, and the North King hasn't intervened?"

"The North King can't intervene!"

Chapter 1: The Gathering of Powers

In the depths of the Myriad Realms, the South King shook his head, "The North King is having a difficult time. Most of his subordinates are somehow entangled with those sealed beings, forcing him to rely heavily on the Dragonblood Marquis. The Land of the Abyss is perilous now. In just a short time, five or six Spirit Suppression Generals have perished. I foresee a Heavenly King battle erupting soon!"

He spoke with a grave tone, "I'm worried they might attack the Four Kings' Domains."

Su Yu chuckled, "No worries. With the South King here, they'll be suppressed somewhat. They probably won't dare to return for now."

The South King nodded, "We still need to make further preparations."

Su Yu acknowledged and asked, "With some Spirit Suppression Generals dead, is there hope for you to advance further?"

The South King sighed and shook his head, "It's difficult. My strength has improved somewhat since the deaths of the East and West Kings, but to advance further... that would mean nearing the true power of a ruler of laws! Unless a few more Heavenly Kings die..."

Su Yu pondered and smiled, "It's not impossible! Let's see. If a few more Heavenly Kings fall, perhaps you could reach the level of a Heavenly Sovereign."

"Heavenly Sovereign?"

"That's the realm of Hundred Battle King."

"Oh!"

The South King understood and nodded, "If three to five more Heavenly Kings die, there might be hope... but only if no one competes with me for it."

"There's hope. Even if the Heavenly Kings aren't enough, the death of some Spirit Suppression Generals could also help!"

Su Yu laughed.

Dragonblood Marquis, keep pushing!

I can feel it. My Death Path is being nourished by you, growing stronger and fatter. Keep going, devour all those under the North King, those sealed beings, and the past powerhouses of the Celestial River of Death. You should soon step into the Heavenly King realm!

Then, kill the North King. Once he's dead, eliminate those sealed beings. I have faith in you. You can become a Heavenly Sovereign, and then I'll extract your path!

By then, perhaps my Death Path page won't be inferior to the Demon Race page, maybe even stronger!

The Demon Race page only absorbed a long-dead ruler of laws. If you devour more Heavenly Kings, the effect should be better!

"Don't touch the Dragonblood Marquis!"

Su Yu reminded again. The South King gave him a thoughtful look, while Marquis Lanshan, not understanding, asked, "Your Majesty, is the Dragonblood Marquis one of ours?"

"No."

"Then..."

"If you don't know, don't ask."

"Understood!"

Marquis Lanshan nodded. Su Yu smiled, "Hurry and step into the Heavenly King realm. You've devoured so many Spirit Suppression Generals, why aren't you there yet?"

Marquis Lanshan felt helpless, feeling that Su Yu was dissatisfied with her!

"Your Majesty knows I'm not as clever as Hetu. I can't comprehend the Great Dao as quickly, and the Death Path isn't my forte..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Alright, take your time."

He then turned to Lantian, "How is Liu Hong?"

Lantian sensed for a moment and smiled, "Still in that place. The Hunting Heaven List is still there, so he should still be alive."

"Still not out?"

Su Yu was surprised, then quickly laughed, "That's not bad!"

With that, his Heaven Gate suddenly opened, and he looked up into the sky.

He was probing the location of the Ink Dao!

To see how much Liu Hong had progressed. In the myriad realms, the branches of the River of Time were too many to observe easily.

But here, the entire Death Path had only one branch, making it easier to locate the Ink Dao.

Soon, Su Yu's eyes lit up. He saw the Ink Dao, and at this moment, a small path was entwining it, showing signs of encircling the Great Dao. This meant Liu Hong might soon step into the Daofuse Realm!

Su Yu squinted his eyes and quickly said, "Once Liu Hong comes out, South King, go find him. Have him stir the Celestial River of Death, forcing the hidden powerhouses there to come out and drive them all to the Land of the Abyss!"

The South King nodded slightly, taking note.

As they walked and arranged matters, the Death Realm was currently stable, except for the unrest in the Land of the Abyss. The Four Kings' Domains and the Spirit Suppression Domain were quiet.

Most of the revived powerhouses in the River had been driven away.

They had all joined the battle in the Land of the Abyss!

After some conversation, they arrived beneath Grand Dream City.

In an instant, Old Turtle appeared, smiling, "Emperor Yu has returned. This old servant apologizes for not welcoming you sooner."

"No need for formalities!"

Old Turtle saw several ancient marquises and greeted them with a smile. Su Yu glanced at Old Turtle and laughed, "It seems you're close to becoming a Heavenly King. Have you gained some insights, Senior Hongmeng?"

"I've gained a little insight. I was only a step away, and now I've taken a small step forward. I'm almost there."

Old Turtle was already a top-tier Daofuse, capable of battling Heavenly Kings.

Now, he gave Su Yu the impression that he could step into that realm at any moment.

Su Yu felt increasingly pleased. Old Turtle, South King, Lantian, Fat Ball, Wan Tiansheng, Great Zhou King, Marquis Lanshan—these individuals were either at that level or nearing it, all close to becoming Heavenly Kings.

With this, his side's combat strength was significantly stronger.

This gave Su Yu a lot of confidence!

This time, going to the Upper Realm, he encountered many strong opponents, which made Su Yu somewhat uneasy. But now, it seemed his side's strength was also advancing rapidly.

After chatting for a while, Su Yu left the Death Realm.

...

Exiting the Death Realm, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

The Death Realm was still somewhat oppressive.

"Let's go, return to the Human Realm!"

Su Yu said, quickly flying towards the Human Realm, with everyone following.

Halfway there, Su Yu suddenly changed direction, heading towards the Fate Realm.

Wan Tiansheng might still be in the Fate Realm.

At this time, Marquis Dingjun and the others looked around, their expressions serious.

The entire Allheaven Battlefield seemed to be filled with slaughter, but it appeared to be the human army attacking various small realms.

Looking at the divine and demon realms, an invisible barrier seemed to appear.

The realms were sealed!

The lower realms had truly fallen into Su Yu's hands!

The more they saw, the more shocked they were.

Hearing about it was one thing, but witnessing it was another. Everyone was deeply impressed.

Even at the peak of Hundred Battle King's era, the human race hadn't achieved this, hadn't conquered the myriad realms.

Moments later, they arrived at the Fate Realm.

The Fate Emperor had already sensed their presence. Indeed, Wan Tiansheng was there too. Seeing Su Yu, the Fate Emperor was also shocked. This person's progress was too fast. His strength... had he reached the quasi-king level?

He was astonished, and others were equally surprised to see the Fate Emperor personally welcoming them.

Fire Cloud Marquis couldn't help but transmit, "This guy, I remember in the last tide, Hundred Battle King wanted to take the Fate Realm, and the Destiny Marquis personally descended to fight. Why is he so obedient now?"

Such a stark contrast!

Hundred Battle King's strength was greater than Su Yu's, and at that time, the human race was even stronger.

"Welcome, Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu waved his hand, "No need for formalities! This time in the Upper Realm, I saw the Destiny Marquis. Indeed, he is powerful, having reached the so-called Heavenly Sovereign realm! Wuming, I didn't get a chance to interact with the Destiny Marquis this time. Next time, find an opportunity to chat with him."

"Of course."

The Fate Emperor smiled, "I am also waiting for the Destiny Marquis to communicate with the lower realm. As soon as he does, I will facilitate this exchange..."

Su Yu smiled, "Thank you!"

He glanced at Wan Tiansheng and said, "Director Wan, please make a trip. I want to summon all the Daofuse of various races! Hold a meeting in the Human Realm! Also, call back those at the Torchbearer lineage! Except for those stationed in the Four Great Domains, all other Daofuse must return!"

"Understood!"

Wan Tiansheng responded and quickly asked, "What about those suppressed in various realms..."

"Bring them along!"

The four Daofuse powerhouses of the Ape, Phoenix, Kunpeng, and Dragon races were all suppressed, with the Dragon race further suppressed in the Culture King's Residence by Su Yu.

At this moment, Su Yu was considering whether to kill these guys.

Suppression could easily lead to problems.

Of course, killing them in the lower realm could trigger a rules phenomenon, but the Culture King's Residence was a place without rules, so killing them might not cause any commotion. The only concern was that killing them might alert the Upper Realm powerhouses.

As for the Dragon race, Su Yu wasn't worried. He had already killed a batch.

The Phoenix race and other strong races...

Su Yu quickly smiled. If it doesn't work, take them to the Upper Realm to kill. Maybe it could lure a few strong individuals from various races to their deaths!

...

Not lingering in the Fate Realm, Su Yu met with Wan Tiansheng, gave a few instructions, and quickly returned to the Eastern Rift Valley.

Another round of greetings ensued. Su Yu's quick return, in less than a month, excited everyone.

Especially since Su Yu brought several ancient powerhouses, greatly boosting the morale of the Great Qin King and others.

The human race's strength was growing stronger!

And Su Yu, upon returning, quickly disappeared from sight.

However, the news of him convening a Daofuse meeting spread rapidly.

...

Eastern Rift Valley.

One by one, the powerhouses began to return.

The human race now had a considerable number of Daofuse combatants.

The Space Ancient Beast Race, led by the Space Ancient Beast Emperor and Huang Jiu, arrived at the Eastern Rift Valley, feeling deeply shocked by the many Daofuse auras they sensed.

While they were in awe, in the distance, the Hou Pseudo Emperor of the Ancient Hou Race also arrived, his eyes flickering as he transmitted, "Old fellow, did you sense it?"

"I sensed it!"

The Space Ancient Beast Emperor was also shocked, transmitting, "How many Daofuse are there here?"

"Not sure, not everyone is here yet!"

As they spoke, Wan Tiansheng walked out, smiling, "Everyone, please gather in the main hall. Emperor Yu is out, not yet returned. Please wait a moment, and take this time to get acquainted, so you don't end up not recognizing your own people!"

The two beast emperors nodded, transformed into human forms, and headed towards the distant Emperor Yu's main hall.

...

At this moment, the main hall was bustling with talent.

The Guardian lineage, along with Old Turtle, had a total of 10 Daofuse, with 6 present today, and 4 guarding the Four Realms.

The Iron Devourer, Space, Ancient Hou, and Fate races had a total of 5 Daofuse, with 4 present.

On the human side, the Great Qin, Great Xia, Great Zhou, Great Ming, Tian Yue, Lantian, Wan Tiansheng, along with the Upper Realm's Marquis Dingjun and the newly Daofuse Chongming, made a total of 13 Daofuse.

The Great Ming King had also been brought back by Marquis Tongtian.

Marquis Tongtian was huddled in a corner with Duobao, whispering furtively. Meanwhile, at the Culture King's Residence, the Book Spirit and Tea Plant had also arrived. Among the Iron Devourer Race, two large furballs were curiously glancing around, wondering why Su Yu had summoned them and why so many Daofuse experts were present.

At this moment, aside from the four Guardians who hadn't arrived, neither Jiuyue nor Fat Ball and the Big Wood from the Culture King's Residence were present.

Inside the grand hall, the Great Qin King was visibly excited. He transmitted a message to the Great Xia King, "Unbelievable! Our Human Race, which once had not a single Daofuse expert, now gathers dozens of them here!"

Over thirty!

Compared to the last tide, it was indeed fewer, but just a year ago, the Human Race had none. Now, the number of Daofuse experts in this hall nearly matched the previous number of Eternal experts! And that doesn't even include those from the Death Realm. If they were counted, it would surpass the previous number of Eternals in the Human Race.

The Human Race experts were thrilled and excited. The experts from other races were equally astounded. It was truly a case of not knowing until you saw it; just the living Daofuse experts alone numbered over thirty. In a short time, Su Yu had gathered experts from all sides, and in the blink of an eye, the Human Race had once again become a top-tier power.

In the lower realm, the three major races wouldn't even dare to seal their realms. Seeing so many Daofuse experts would drive them to despair.

As everyone whispered among themselves, they suddenly sensed two powerful auras.

In an instant, Su Yu arrived, stepping along the River of Time. Accompanying him was none other than the White Dog, Fat Ball.

At this moment, Fat Ball was also curiously looking around. Seeing so many people, it was a bit surprised and turned to glance at Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled and said, "Stop looking around, don't worry. I've left the Starry Sky Seal and the Human Lord Seal over there. They can suppress things for three to five years!"

"But my flowers..."

"The Big Wood will water them!"

"Well... alright then."

Fat Ball had no choice but to accept it. After all, Su Yu had returned the Little Stone, and with the Human Lord Seal also suppressing things, the absence of the White Dog wouldn't matter. Moreover, the Big Wood had gained intelligence and could take on the task of watering the flowers. With that, it could leave for ten days or half a month without any issues.

As Su Yu landed, the White Dog curiously looked around, then flew over to Doubao, landing beside it. Doubao's large eyes showed a hint of confusion, "My little guy didn't come?"

Did you leave my little guy behind again?

Fat Ball shook its head, and from its ear, a small furball flew out, looking somewhat aggrieved. It glanced at Su Yu above, puffed up with anger, and flew onto the big furball's head.

Xiangxiang doesn't love me anymore, not even letting me hide in his sea of will.

Su Yu didn't pay attention to this. His sea of will was now filled with powerful entities, and if the small furball entered and accidentally triggered something, it could lead to trouble.

Seeing Fat Ball jump over to Doubao, Su Yu didn't say anything. He looked around and smiled, "There are still a few Daofuse experts who haven't arrived, and I haven't summoned anyone from the Death Realm yet!"

"Seeing all of you here lifts my spirits."

Su Yu smiled and said, "When I went to the Upper Realm, I saw many Daofuse experts from various races and quite a few Heavenly Kings. Initially, I felt pressured, but now... my Luminous Domain Mansion isn't weak either!"

Below, Lantian stepped forward and smiled, "Emperor Yu, there's no need for modesty. During this trip to the Upper Realm, Emperor Yu slew ten Heavenly Kings and eight Daofuse experts, showcasing the might of our Luminous Domain Mansion..."

At this moment, Lantian had transformed into an elderly figure, appearing wise and composed. His words left everyone in shock.

What a joke!

How many did he kill?

How long has he been up there?

Su Yu gestured for silence, smiling, "Alright, no need for flattery! When I was weak, I needed achievements to prove my strength. But now, I don't need it anymore! Although I'm not invincible across the Myriad Realms, at my level, I'm not afraid of those old guys in the Upper Realm!"

Su Yu chuckled, looking at everyone, "There are many strong experts in the Upper Realm. As per my classification, everyone knows that above the top-tier Daofuse, there are Heavenly Kings. Now, I realize that above the Heavenly Kings, there are even stronger Heavenly Sovereigns, like those in the realm of Hundred Battle King, and there are quite a few of them!"

"Our Luminous Domain Mansion still has a gap compared to them, and it's not small!"

"Among us, only Fat Ball, Hongmeng, Lantian, and I have reached this level. The Great Zhou King, Director Wan, Doubao, Marquis Huoyun, and the Fate Emperor are only second-tier Daofuse!"

Everyone looked at the Fate Emperor, who remained calm, smiling without speaking.

Su Yu smiled, "The Fate Emperor isn't weak, so don't stare. Others, like Marquis Yunshui, Shadow Marquis, the Great Qin King, and the Great Xia King, are just a step away from second-tier Daofuse!"

"Such strength isn't weak!"

Su Yu said gravely, "But it's not enough, far from enough!"

"We're still lacking!"

Below, everyone was solemn, though some were less concerned. Heavendoom rolled his eyes, thinking, "Am I not even worthy of being mentioned?"

How sad!

With so many strong experts, am I, a Daofuse, worthless now?

Truly heartbreaking!

Su Yu ignored his thoughts and continued, "Regarding the situation in the Upper Realm, I believe Shadow Marquis and others have already informed you! Including the traitors from the Control King's lineage, their strength might be beyond imagination!"

"If a three-way war breaks out now, our Luminous Domain Mansion would likely be the weakest!"

The Great Zhou King stepped forward, smiling, "Your Majesty, that might not be the case! Our Luminous Domain Mansion has allies. The Iron Devourer Race has agreed to ally with us! March has the power of a Heavenly Sovereign, and Marquis Giant Bamboo has the combat strength of a Heavenly King! If the Fate Clan is willing to ally, Marquis Destiny also possesses Heavenly Sovereign power... we might not be the weakest!"

Su Yu gestured for silence, "These are all unknowns, let's not mention them! Relying on others is not as good as relying on ourselves! Unknown factors shouldn't be counted on; counting on them might lead to disappointment!"

"Before that, our Luminous Domain Mansion's Daofuse numbers have been increasing, but advancing in Daofuse is difficult. There's not enough understanding of the Great Dao, not enough power of laws!"

"This time, in the Upper Realm, I've gained a lot of unclaimed power of laws!"

"Additionally, I've obtained a map of the Great Dao from the ancient Human Emperor!"

Su Yu looked at everyone, speaking gravely, "I'm not one to hoard treasures! I'm willing to share good things with everyone, to help you all improve your strength, to be confident in facing stronger opponents without paying a bloody price!"

"Since I became the Human Lord, every battle we've fought has been a surprise attack, a blitzkrieg. We've never fought a large-scale frontal battle!"

"It's not that we must fight head-on, but... our strength can't be hidden forever!"

Su Yu declared loudly, "Sooner or later, the myriad races will know our strength! At that time, it will be a real battle! Some of you might fall, and I can't guarantee otherwise!"

"I can only do my best to make everyone stronger! To have enough power to defeat the enemy!"

Su Yu looked at them, speaking gravely, "No more words. I will grant you the corresponding power of laws based on your previous contributions! Everyone will have a chance to comprehend the Great Dao map, but those with greater contributions, I will personally take you on a journey along the River of Time to observe your specific Great Dao, and even open a temporary Heaven Gate for you to comprehend the Great Dao!"

"This time, I hope some of us can become Heavenly Kings! Great Zhou King, including Doubao, I hope you can all enter the Heavenly King realm!"

"And for the rest, I hope everyone makes some progress!"

With that, Su Yu smiled, "If we can produce a few more Heavenly Kings, I will soon return to the Upper Realm with even greater strength to participate in the upcoming battle at Chaos Mountain!"

"Great Qin King and Great Xia King..."

Su Yu looked at the two, speaking gravely, "If you two can't enter the second-tier Daofuse realm this time, then the Desolate Beast corpse I gave you will be wasted! If you both enter the second-tier Daofuse, I will take you to the Upper Realm, to see Chaos Mountain, where the Desolate Beast originally lived, and perhaps find your opportunities there!"

"But if you can't enter the second-tier Daofuse realm... then stay in the Human Realm!"

"......"

The Great Xia King and the Great Qin King felt immense pressure.

How embarrassing!

It was almost like being publicly criticized.

Because they had consumed the Desolate Beast, a true master of laws, and were still at the peak of the third tier, Su Yu's words left them feeling ashamed.

Su Yu then looked at the ancient marquises, especially Marquis Huoyun, "Huoyun, you're at the peak of the second tier, close to the Heavenly King level! However, your contributions aren't enough for me to take you on a journey along the River of Time to comprehend the Great Dao... As for your struggles in the Upper Realm for thousands of years, that's unrelated to me, and I won't count it as merit!"

Marquis Huoyun was solemn, speaking in a low voice, "I dare not accept rewards without merit, and I won't trouble Your Majesty!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "However, I need people now. If you can enter the Heavenly King realm, it's also a good thing for me! I can give you a chance, an advance reward for a great merit, but you must kill a Heavenly King for me! Until you kill a Heavenly King, no matter how much merit you earn, it won't be rewarded!"

Marquis Huoyun took a deep breath, stood up, and stepped forward, "Huoyun thanks Your Majesty for the generous reward and will surely slay a Heavenly King to repay this merit!"

Su Yu nodded slightly and said no more about him.

As for the Fate Emperor, he didn't mention it. When Marquis Destiny meets with me, we'll discuss these matters.

The Fate Emperor was self-aware and didn't speak up. He hadn't contributed much and joined Su Yu late, so he wasn't as worthy of cultivation as the Iron Devourer Race.

Su Yu continued, "The Dragon Race's Heavenly Dragon Marquis and other strong experts have been personally suppressed by me and will be taken to the Upper Realm! The three major realms are currently sealed. This time, I will leave a few Daofuse experts to guard them, and the rest, I will take to the Upper Realm as appropriate... Of course, the foundation is third-tier Daofuse! Preferably second-tier Daofuse, as those too weak aren't needed!"

"......"

Below, someone finally couldn't hold back. Heavendoom couldn't help but ask, "What about me..."

Su Yu cast a sidelong glance at him. "You're only at the fifth-tier Daofuse Realm. Too weak. If you can reach the third-tier Daofuse this time, I'll take you with me. Otherwise... you better stay behind in the Myriad Realms!"

Heavendoom's face turned purple. How could this be? Once again, he was being left behind!

Fuming with indignation, he glanced at Grandstar, who remained calm and composed. In a low voice, Grandstar transmitted, "Don't bother looking. I'll be going up. I was already at the fourth-tier before, and after comprehending the Great Dao Diagram, I'll soon reach the third-tier... Heavendoom, it seems you'll be eating my dust again!"

"......"

I want to bash your head in with a stick!

Heavendoom was on the verge of madness, utterly frustrated. He couldn't accept it! Grandstar always managed to get ahead of him, whether it was becoming the city lord or ascending to the Upper Realm. Now, Grandstar's strength had even surpassed his own. It was simply too much!

This time, Grandstar had indeed gained a lot from the Upper Realm. He had absorbed a significant amount of the power of laws, comprehended the Great Dao Diagram, and participated in several battles involving the Heavenly Kings. In short, his gains far exceeded those from the Lower Realm.

Now, catching up to him was no easy task for Heavendoom. Grandstar, though outwardly calm, was inwardly smug. He transmitted again, "Stay here and guard the Lower Realm. I'll go up and kill a few, record the footage, and bring it back for you to watch."

Go to hell!

Heavendoom was losing his mind!

Meanwhile, Su Yu said nothing more. Streams of the power of laws flew towards the various Daofuse cultivators according to their merits. Those who had followed him up previously did not receive any more.

In the Lower Realm, June, Doubao, and Hongmeng received noticeably more than others, as did the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King. The guardians also received a fair share, with Heavendoom getting quite a bit.

After distributing everything, Su Yu's Mark of Civilization appeared, and the book cover crafted from the Great Dao Diagram was displayed before everyone. With a wave of his hand, the entire hall was enveloped in black and white.

"Everyone, observe the Dao well!" Su Yu's voice resonated like a great bell. "This is the Human Emperor's comprehension of the Great Dao, along with some of my own insights. If you gain understanding and have enough power of laws, you can quickly convert it into your own strength!"

"For now, only the Daofuse cultivators will be rewarded. Those below Daofuse will be rewarded next time based on their contributions!"

With those words, Su Yu floated out, leaving the others to sit cross-legged, each with a look of excitement. The Great Dao Diagram of the Human Emperor was something that even Daofuse cultivators in ancient times might not have had the privilege to observe, likely only the masters of laws could, and not even in its entirety. Now, they were fortunate enough to see it.

...

Outside the Emperor Yu Hall, Su Yu exhaled, glancing back with hope that these people would gain something. The pressure was still there. Returning to the Upper Realm, if the situation changed, another great battle might erupt.

He still needed to take some people to walk the River of Time, to see it firsthand, as the true River of Time couldn't be seen in the Upper Realm.

Beside him, Lantian appeared with a giggle, no longer the old man from before but a familiar little girl, laughing, "Brother Emperor Yu, do you think Brother Tiansheng can become a Heavenly King this time?"

Su Yu was speechless but accustomed to it. He smiled, "Hard to say! He's opening the Human Dao, and recently, I think he's been comprehending the Dao of Death. Maybe he has a chance, maybe not. It depends on luck!"

Wan Tiansheng was indeed a prodigy. The Human Dao was a powerful path, but his foundation was still somewhat lacking. Whether he could advance to a Heavenly King, Su Yu couldn't predict.

Lantian giggled, "He'll definitely make it. Brother Tiansheng is a freak, and freaks can go further!"

"......"

There was no way to respond to that!

Su Yu ignored him and looked towards the distant Great Zhou King, smiling, "Let's go, Great Zhou King. Let's take a trip along the River of Time. Let me see if the two paths of endurance can merge. If not... your importance will decrease significantly if you don't enter the Heavenly King domain!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, feeling a sense of crisis. It was over! He had to advance to a Heavenly King! Otherwise, in this era filled with prodigies, even his scheming wouldn't be needed. Wan Tiansheng and others were gradually taking over his role, and that wouldn't do!

In an instant, the River of Time was torn open, and the two of them entered it immediately.
