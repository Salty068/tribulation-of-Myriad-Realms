Chapter 776: All for the Sake of the Lord (Requesting Subscription)

The Great Dao merged, causing the River of Time to tremble.

A struggle for the Dao!

Indeed, as more individuals merged into it, Su Yu suddenly sensed an ominous feeling.

Trouble!

A struggle for the Great Dao!

At this moment, Su Yu had a premonition. It seemed like he was in a bit of trouble, but perhaps it wasn't too severe. Yet, he was seizing something from the River of Time.

"A struggle for the Great Dao... the Celestial River of Death..."

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly had a vague feeling. Could the disappearance of the master of the Death Path be related to the master of the River of Time's Dao?

Because the Lord of Death had seized control of death energy from the Lord of Time!

"A struggle for the Great Dao?"

"What exactly is this Great Dao? Is it a struggle between the pioneers of the heavens? Or between different rules? Or between different eras?"

Su Yu watched the ever-expanding new world, a sense of foreboding in his heart.

Perhaps... one day, I will meet the master of the Time Dao.

Perhaps, meeting them would spell trouble.

Because it seems like we're all taking advantage of him.

He nurtured the Myriad Realms, and as a result, both he, the Human Emperor, and the master of the Death Path, in their quest for shortcuts, directly stole the power he converted. Normally, it should have been used to convert chaos!

But converting chaos was too slow.

So, we few thieves... if the master encounters us, wouldn't he beat us to death?

At this moment, Su Yu inexplicably felt a bit embarrassed.

I... didn't steal anything!

It was the Human Emperor and the master of the Death Path who stole. Look at me, I opened the heavens without connecting to you, but now, it's Lantian and the others forcing me to steal. I'm quite innocent.

I was also crowned against my will!

Su Yu sighed hypocritically. Yes, I didn't steal, though I did have the thought. Mainly, I was worried that the opening in the River of Time was too large, and too much power would flow in, assimilating me.

In the end, Lantian and the others brought their skills to me!

That's the gist of it!

These people originally had the power of the Great Dao within them. Now, they have essentially switched allegiances. If they were on the side of the Lord of Time, they would be considered traitors to their sect!

And after switching allegiances, they even integrated the rules they learned from the Time Dao into Su Yu's side, instantly strengthening Su Yu's power. The power of the River of Time was, in essence, slightly weakened.

Of course, very slightly.

A group of people who hadn't reached the realm of the rule masters leaving wouldn't have much impact on the River of Time.

...

While Su Yu was contemplating these matters.

The River of Time.

Continued to surge.

This time, the surges came one after another, and the power of the river was somewhat turbulent.

Upstream, those like the Human Emperor clearly sensed it.

In fact, it wasn't just the Human Emperor.

At the same time.

In the Human Realm, within the Physical Dao.

Someone also sensed it.

Sitting cross-legged within the Physical Dao, Hundred Battle suddenly opened his eyes. The waves were impacting the entire River of Time. Although not too intense, he still felt the fluctuations.

At this moment, a group of people was also beside Hundred Battle.

Yes, he had brought people directly.

Within the Physical Dao, Hundred Battle suppressed the power of the Dao, allowing those dozens of people to absorb the power of the physical body, directly restoring their bodies, much more conveniently than Su Yu's side.

Upstream, the Physical Dao's Human King sensed the decline in physical power. It wasn't that Hundred Battle was extracting a lot, but to restore these powerful subordinates, he was suppressing the fluctuations of the entire Physical Dao, supplying the power of the physical rules to his subordinates for cultivation.

At this time, some people also sensed the fluctuations of the river.

Someone said in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, is there trouble with the river's disturbance?"

Hundred Battle looked towards the main river channel for a long time, then said softly, "No problem!"

He looked at the people below, calmly saying, "Quickly absorb the power. If the suppression lasts too long, some upstream Physical Dao Human Kings will weaken. It's best not to let them be killed at this time, or else grudges will form!"

Upon hearing this, many were startled and hurriedly began to recover.

Someone quickly asked, "Your Majesty, if we extract too much, will the upstream Human Kings be weakened?"

"They will."

Hundred Battle said indifferently, "But if you absorb quickly, I will extract the physical power from the River of Time to replenish the previous consumption!"

The crowd dared not delay any longer and quickly began cultivating.

For six thousand years, many people's physical bodies hadn't recovered, remaining in a state of willpower, rapidly progressing in understanding the power of the Great Dao. Without the limitations of the physical body, progress was swift, but now that they were restoring their physical bodies, the power needed would be even greater!

Moments later, a low shout was heard.

A figure appeared, with an incredibly robust physique, an ethereal aura, vaguely resembling a rule master, but not following the path of the physical body, rather his own path.

At this moment, he quickly appeared beside Hundred Battle, smiling, "Your Majesty!"

Hundred Battle also smiled, "Congratulations, Marquis Changqing!"

Marquis Changqing, his top strategist and a top powerhouse under his command back then.

Six thousand years later, seeing Changqing again, now, as his physical body recovered, his realm was also revealed, Heavenly Sovereign!

A powerhouse with the realm of a rule master.

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Marquis Changqing's long hair fluttered, quickly settling as he stood behind Hundred Battle, looking at the people below with a smile, "This time, we will be stronger than last time! I think we won't need to hide for another six thousand years!"

Hundred Battle nodded slightly, smiling, "I don't want to either!"

As he spoke, a roar was heard, boom!

A gigantic figure appeared!

That gigantic figure, wielding a door-like long blade, flew over, laughing heartily, "Your Majesty!"

"Wuji!"

Hundred Battle smiled again, the two powerful figures, Wen and Wu, had both revived!

At this moment, Wuji's aura was also extremely formidable, even faintly surpassing Changqing.

Wuji laughed heartily, "Your Majesty, six thousand years feel like yesterday! How have you been these six thousand years, Your Majesty?"

"Not bad!"

Hundred Battle beamed, and Changqing also smiled, "Wuji, it seems your blade path has improved again. This time, you can enjoy yourself without complaining to us every day like before!"

"No way!"

Wuji, towering in stature, laughed heartily, "I never complained!"

With that, he looked at Hundred Battle, his smile growing brighter, "Your Majesty, shall we charge out directly this time? Wipe out the Myriad Races and the Control King's lineage?"

"No rush!"

Hundred Battle chuckled, and Changqing's smile softened, "What's the hurry!"

With that, he spoke, "Your Majesty, we've vaguely heard about the Human Race's tide. Su Yu has left with his people. Should we secure the internal before dealing with the external, or should we unite against the external first, then the internal? How well do you know Su Yu, Your Majesty?"

He merely presented two options, leaving the decision to Hundred Battle.

Wuji, however, was straightforward, "Your Majesty, let's deal with Su Yu first! Does he think sealing the Death Realm means we can't get through? Two tigers can't share one mountain. If we fight to the death in the Upper Realm, and this kid suddenly pops up and hits us, wouldn't that be unlucky?"

His thoughts were direct.

Su Yu had taken people to the Death Realm, right beneath them. Ignoring it could easily lead to trouble.

Hundred Battle King said softly, "No need, let's deal with the Control King's lineage and the Myriad Races first!"

With that, he glanced at the people below still restoring their physical bodies, speaking softly, "I know everyone is listening. Some may not want me to have internal strife with Su Yu... I won't rashly conflict with him, rest assured."

Below, someone responded, their voice gentle, "Your Majesty, regarding Su Yu, we have heard, and he hasn't done anything outrageous, lacking a legitimate reason! The people's hearts are with him. Attacking Su Yu now isn't wise. Wuji doesn't like to use his brain, so he should offer fewer suggestions!"

A person ascended into the air, Wuji glanced at them, pursed his lips, and said nothing.

It was a woman.

Full of spirit, her long hair cascading over her shoulders, dressed in a glazed robe, yet not concealing her voluptuous figure.

The woman smiled, her voice not heavy, yet somewhat aggressive, "Your Majesty, if you can take the Upper Realm, defeat the Myriad Races and the Control King's lineage, naturally, Su Yu's subordinates will recognize your great achievements! If Su Yu is defeated then, everyone will willingly join, all for the Human Race!"

"If Your Majesty fails, the Human Race still has a backup!"

"I've heard about Su Yu. Though young and impulsive, he has vigor. We are old, planning more, but youth has its advantages too!"

The woman smiled, looking at Marquis Changqing, "Changqing, don't incite His Majesty to do anything! Our struggle with Su Yu lies in the current control of the Human Realm. Since Su Yu has stepped aside, why pursue relentlessly, forcing him into a corner?"

She looked at Hundred Battle, then at Wuji, "You must understand, we are ancient people from six thousand years ago! A generation changes every hundred years, that's 60 generations. Su Yu and his peers are the talents of this era. Killing Su Yu will only drive us further from the Human Race!"

The woman continued, "All of you have fought across the lands, always with a belief!"

Her voice grew grand, "This belief is in everyone's heart! The Human Race! Whether it's the Human Race passed down by the Human Ancestor or the one inherited from the Human Emperor, it's all the Human Race!"

"The Control King colluding with chaos must be killed!"

"But Su Yu hasn't colluded with chaos..."

Before she could finish, someone grumbled, "Isn't he colluding with the Myriad Races? Look at who he has under him!"

Below, another person ascended, older in age, appearing more aged, looking at the woman, "Hongyue, Su Yu relies mostly on the power of the Myriad Races. What do you think?"

Hongyue looked at him, saying nothing.

Below, another person broke through the air, a young man in black attire, his tone cold, "Marquis Changmei, enough, why care so much about some things! Su Yu relies on the Iron Devourer Race, you know it, I know it! Face reality, don't shirk responsibility. Six thousand years ago, we gave up, that's a fact. Since we gave up, are others not allowed to save themselves?"

He looked coldly at the elder, then at Changqing and the others. "Hongyue is right, Your Majesty. Su Yu is gaining the people's support. We already occupy the Human Realm, and the people are anxious. Do we really want to force a complete break with the human race? Aren't we humans too?"

He glanced around at everyone. "We are also humans! Even if the humans six thousand years later don't recognize us, we are still humans! Changqing and Changmei's words are just excuses to shirk responsibility! Collaborating with the myriad races? What does that even mean? By that logic, we might as well label the Human Emperor and others as traitors too!"

His tone turned slightly hostile. "Others can say what they want, but Your Majesty should not listen to such slander! Six thousand years ago, when Your Majesty was defeated by all sides and chose not to fight to the death, we understood. We were all deserters!"

"Since we became deserters, we should have the consciousness of deserters. There's no need to glorify ourselves and vilify others! Changqing merely suggested, but Changmei, you went ahead and accused them of collaborating with the myriad races... You're not someone to be trusted!"

With a cold snort, the elder with long eyebrows slightly furrowed his brows. "Xueying, are you calling us deserters?"

The cold young man replied indifferently, "Whether we are or not, history will judge! I am, you are, what's there to argue about? Of course, being outmatched and choosing to flee is a tactic. I also thought we should flee; otherwise, I wouldn't have followed His Majesty back then! But fleeing is something we should be aware of. Don't think you're right. Maybe you think you're right, but to the humans six thousand years later, we abandoned them!"

"For six thousand years, they had no support. Over four hundred years ago, the myriad races had countless strong experts, and the humans didn't even have a single Eternal. Later, some Eternals emerged, but they were slow to reach the Daofuse Realm... His Majesty cut off their path to physical advancement, and now we want to blame them for collaborating with the myriad races... Do we really want to make them our mortal enemies?"

Xueying said coldly, "We can say it's a difference in ideology, but don't put such heavy labels on others! Changmei, I've always been annoyed by people like you!"

Changmei's aura fluctuated as he coldly said, "Are you trying to shake the people's hearts?"

"Say that again if you dare."

Xueying also looked at him coldly. "Shake the people's hearts? We've waited six thousand years for His Majesty. If it's so easy to shake, then we might as well disband! If His Majesty relies on people like you to govern and win over others, I will naturally leave if I'm dissatisfied. Do I need you to drive me away?"

With a cold snort, his black hair fluttered. "Changmei, don't think that just because you've stepped into the so-called Heavenly Sovereign Realm, you can do whatever you want. Back then, I didn't want His Majesty to bring along a sycophant like you, and I still feel the same now! Changqing offers advice, but you, you like to make decisions on your own! If you dare to incite His Majesty again, I'll make an example out of you!"

Changmei was furious!

Hundred Battle glanced at the few of them—Changqing, Wujie, Hongyue, Changmei, and Xueying. These five newly awakened powerhouses were all top-tier existences, all possessing Heavenly Sovereign-level combat strength.

This was the greatest gain over the years.

Of course, there were Heavenly Sovereigns in the past too, but they had fallen, like Bingku.

At this moment, these few were all considered late-stage advancements.

Hundred Battle saw the tension among them and slightly furrowed his brows. "Enough! We're all brothers here, fighting for so many years, and still at odds! Changmei, what Xueying said is my sentiment as well. There's no need to bring this up again!"

Changmei slightly frowned, his long eyebrows trembling. "Your Majesty, you know me. I have no personal motives!"

Hundred Battle nodded slightly. He understood Changmei's intentions.

He looked down calmly and said, "What Xueying said is true. Since everyone is with me, there's no need for these tactics! Those who wish to stay can stay, and those who don't can go find Su Yu!"

"Of course, I won't deceive you. At this moment, Su Yu probably won't accept outsiders! If you have such intentions, think thrice before acting!"

This wasn't a lie, because of the Yunshui Marquis incident. It would be strange if Su Yu was willing to accept outsiders now!

No one spoke.

Soon, more people awakened, this time weaker ones, at the Heavenly King level.

Following that, second-tier Daofuse, third-tier Daofuse, gradually recovered.

The stronger one's strength, the stronger the body recovered, but the faster they could absorb power, so recovery was naturally quicker than the weaker ones.

Gradually, people gathered.

Forty-five.

Forty-five newly awakened powerhouses, plus Nanxi, Yunshui, Jiang Hai, Shadow, and Mist Mountain, a total of fifty powerhouses, plus Hundred Battle, making it fifty-one!

Even the weakest had third-tier Daofuse strength.

Fourth and fifth tiers were almost nonexistent.

There were many third-tier Daofuse, quite a few second-tier, and the rest were Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Sovereigns, with formidable strength.

This didn't even include the Ancient Giant King, as no one from the Ancient Giant Race came.

If included, there was still a Heavenly Sovereign-level Thunderstorm in the Upper Realm.

A total of six Heavenly Sovereign powerhouses, plus an existence like Hundred Battle.

Hundred Battle glanced around and smiled, "Everyone has made some progress, not bad, with five Heavenly Sovereign-level existences born, stronger than before!"

There were fewer people, but the strength was not weak.

The weaker Daofuse either died or progressed now, starting from third-tier Daofuse, such strength was extremely powerful even in the Upper Realm.

The myriad races had many Daofuse, as did the Control King's lineage.

However, a third-tier Daofuse could fight two, even four or five weaker ones.

There were many second-tier Daofuse, and perhaps soon, someone would step into the Heavenly Sovereign Realm.

At this moment, Changqing also showed joy and softly said, "Your Majesty, then... about Yunling..."

Hundred Battle glanced at everyone, "When there are ten Heavenly Sovereigns, we'll find a way to seek breakthroughs!"

Currently, not counting Hundred Battle, including Thunderstorm, there were only six, four short.

But Hundred Battle felt it was close.

Several Heavenly Kings seemed close to reaching the Heavenly Sovereign domain.

Ten!

This was unimaginable in the past.

But now, there was hope.

The myriad races had many Heavenly Sovereigns, but they were not united, and the myriad races lacked a supreme powerhouse like Hundred Battle.

Using six thousand years of dormancy to break free was a good thing.

As everyone was pondering, Changmei spoke again, "Your Majesty, will Su Yu's side cause trouble? His conquest of the Myriad Realms is known to all! Once the Upper and Lower Realms open, the myriad races in the Upper Realm will surely know. At that time, if they attack Su Yu first... It's hard to judge Su Yu's current strength."

How many strong experts did Su Yu have under him?

At this moment, no one was too sure.

Jiang Hai and the others saw some things in the Upper Realm, but no one could guarantee the situation on Su Yu's side.

Hundred Battle said softly, "Alright, let's not worry about Su Yu for now! The battle in the Upper Realm will cease for now. The myriad races and the Control King's lineage haven't decided to tear each other apart yet. This matter needs more time."

"And about Moon Luo..."

Changmei asked again.

Hundred Battle chuckled, "It's fine, there will be arrangements on that side too! Rest assured, six thousand years ago, fighting the myriad races alone, we might not have won. Now, if we face the myriad races again, it should be enough!"

Six thousand years ago, although they seemed strong, many old antiques didn't show up.

Truly fighting the myriad races to the end might not have been beneficial.

Now, their strength had grown significantly.

Especially himself, from barely able to fight the Control King's lineage's old ancestor six thousand years ago, to now, if he met that old ancestor again... it would be a different story!

...

On Hundred Battle's side, the strong gathered.

Three days later.

On Su Yu's side, the truly strong also gathered.

Below the Heavenly King level, almost everyone chose to fuse their paths, unless there was only one path, and everyone cultivated that path, then they had to give it up.

At this point, Su Yu's subordinates were also filled with strong experts.

There were many with Heavenly King combat strength: Fat Ball, Doubao, Hongmeng, Great Zhou King, Wan Tiansheng, Lantian, Fate Emperor, Consort Qi, Marquis Huoyun, and the newly ascended Heavenly Kings, Flatbread and September. These two, in the past few days, one borrowed the legacy of February, the other borrowed Consort Qi's pseudo-path, both stepping into the Heavenly King realm.

Several pseudo-Heavenly Kings were also born, Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Grandstar, and Yingwu all stepped into the pseudo-Heavenly King domain. Marquis Dingjun actually had hope, but he was somewhat depressed because he also walked the spear path.

The spear path was occupied by the Great Qin King.

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun was beyond sad, missing the opportunity to eat hot food, and had to lament.

At this point, it truly felt like a gathering of talents.

But Su Yu felt it was still not enough.

Heavenly Sovereign combat strength was still lacking, Fat Ball would probably be the first to step into the Heavenly Sovereign domain, Lantian had a good chance, Wan Tiansheng was uncertain.

The greatest assurance was actually the South Heavenly King.

Once the South Heavenly King revived, there was a ninety percent chance he would step into the Heavenly Sovereign domain.

Even if he couldn't walk the Time Great Dao, integrating into Su Yu's Great Dao, Su Yu speculated that the South Heavenly King had a chance to step into the realm of the ruler of laws, directly mastering a path, becoming a pseudo-ruler of laws.

At this point, revival must be prioritized!

And Su Yu was actually preparing.

He looked at Liu Hong, who had not been slow in his progress, but Su Yu feared it would be troublesome for him to suppress the Death Path.

He thought of Marquis Dragonblood!

Perhaps, Marquis Dragonblood should do something, like killing the North King and others, devouring them, and then, at the critical moment, becoming a Heavenly King or even a Heavenly Sovereign, ideally a ruler of laws!

In this way, at the critical moment, this guy could reverse suppress the fluctuations of the Death Path.

Marquis Dragonblood's path as the child of destiny might end here!

Today, Su Yu's subordinates had many pseudo-Heavenly Kings, many pseudo-second-tier Daofuse, which translated to third-tier existences, and there were many third-tier Daofuse.

All 31 guardians had stepped into the Daofuse realm!

Purely from this perspective, it was an incredibly powerful force.

Moreover, Su Yu had a trump card, the Sanctification Seal, which would be of great use at critical moments!

"In just a few days..."

Su Yu looked at everyone, his thoughts fluctuating, a powerful force, much stronger than before!

The next moment, his Great Dao Diagram suddenly emerged from the heavens and earth.

"Everyone, the Great Dao Diagram—some of you have seen it before, some haven't. But even if you have, it doesn't matter! The Dao you comprehend now is different from before!"

"Look again, and you will surely gain something!"

"I need to prepare for a while to awaken the dead spirits. Meanwhile, you all can cultivate here and observe the Great Dao Diagram. I hope each of you can step into the Heavenly Sovereign Realm on your own!"

...

The Great Dao Diagram floated in the air, and everyone was almost overwhelmed as they once again received the infusion and enlightenment of the Dao. These days, they were both immensely joyful and painfully overwhelmed. The joy lay in the abundance of opportunities, continuously deepening their understanding of the Dao. The pain lay in the overwhelming insights, leaving everyone feeling somewhat indigested.

...

Su Yu did not linger long. He led Hetu, Liu Hong, and the others, flying towards the Death Realm. Hetu was a mix of excitement, anticipation, and anxiety. Revival! And he was the first candidate. He had wanted to be revived before, but now that it was really happening, he was filled with unease.

Su Yu ignored his anxiety, speaking as they flew, "Back then, the Culture King prepared four Great Daos of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone for revival... But my path differs from the Culture King's because I have opened the heavens myself. I might let everyone revive within my own world!"

"The Culture King might have opened the heavens too, but he probably wanted to revive people directly in the River of Time, making his choice more difficult. Mine is relatively simpler!"

Su Yu quickly added, "The challenge for me lies in how to separate everyone from their existence in the Death Dao and grant them life. That is the hardest part—bringing the dead back to life is no small matter!"

The others nodded, and Liu Hong said gravely, "This is indeed not easy! Especially for me, Your Majesty, I truly can't guarantee that I can suppress the Death Dao! This Dao is too powerful; it's not something a third-tier Daofuse like me can handle!"

Su Yu nodded, "I know, so someone will assist you!"

Who? Liu Hong wondered. Could it be the South Heavenly King and the others? That would still be difficult! Besides, the South King and the others are also part of the Dao. If they truly resist the power of the Dao, something might go wrong!

Su Yu didn't concern himself with them. He quickly flew to a certain area and said to the others, "You go to the research institute first. I'll go inquire about the situation."

Hetu and the others glanced over. This was also within the Death Realm, especially in the Spirit Suppression Domain, one of the most unique places. An ancient castle stood there, having existed for countless ages. From the time of the Human Emperor to the era of Emperor Yu, it still stood, even after Su Yu had swept through the entire Spirit Suppression Domain. This place remained untouched; no one dared to disturb the ancient castle.

Hetu chuckled, "Then Your Majesty, have a good chat with Xingyue. We'll head to the research institute first!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, ignoring their looks, and stepped into the air.

After he left, Hetu laughed, "His Majesty seems quite concerned about Xingyue. I think reviving us is just a side task. Is this revival plan specifically for Xingyue?"

Liu Hong glanced at him but remained silent. He couldn't be bothered to respond. Whether it was or wasn't, he wouldn't comment. If he did, and it reached Su Yu's ears, that petty guy might cause trouble! I won't fall for that trap! Hetu might be courting death, but I have no intention of doing so. Liu Hong secretly noted that if Hetu provoked him again, he could sell Hetu out to Su Yu. Who knows, it might fetch a good price!

...

Xingyue Castle.

The castle was silent. The massive gates were tightly shut. As Su Yu approached through the air, some of Xingyue's subordinate dead spirits recognized him and were overjoyed. Several quasi-invincible dead spirits knelt and greeted, "Welcome, Grand Commander!"

Ever since Su Yu had once impersonated the Grand Commander, the dead spirits here had always addressed him this way, even though they knew Su Yu was now the master of the Death Realm.

Su Yu smiled, glancing at the closed gates, and said, "Is Lord Xingyue in seclusion?"

"I don't think so!" A dead spirit named Xing Da, named by Su Yu, hesitated and said, "The Lord didn't mention going into seclusion, but she hasn't left the castle for a few days."

Su Yu smiled, nodded, and stepped towards the castle. "Lord Xingyue, I'm coming in!"

"Get lost!"

A sudden angry shout came from inside the fortress. Su Yu chuckled and pushed the door open. Get lost? Such a temper!

...

Inside the grand hall, Xingyue's already dark face turned even darker as she coldly stared at Su Yu. "What are you here for?"

"To report recent developments to you, my lord..."

Xingyue sneered, "Stop pretending! Su Yu, the death spirit channel between us is severed. You walk your path, and I'll live my death spirit life. Now, I have nothing you can scheme for. Do you want treasures? Take this castle if you want!"

Su Yu laughed, "You're joking, my lord! About the death spirit channel..."

"Heh, I don't want to hear it!"

Su Yu shrugged, then suddenly shouted, "Shut up! Women are so annoying! Listen to me!"

This sudden outburst made Xingyue tremble. Just as she was about to speak, Su Yu's powerful pressure swept over, directly suppressing her. Xingyue glared angrily! Too much!

Su Yu then smiled and said, "Back then, I was opening the Great Dao of Life and Death, understand? I was on the verge of death, needing the aura of life, and you kept sending me death energy. Were you hoping I'd die immediately?"

Xingyue was slightly stunned. What nonsense?

Su Yu continued, "Women, even in death, are troublesome! I almost died because of you. My lord, you nearly killed me, you know?"

"So many people are counting on me to live, and you almost got me killed. I didn't even say anything, and you're still mad at me?"

Su Yu snorted, "I'm not mad at you, my lord, because I'm kind-hearted. Considering you meant well, I decided not to hold it against you!"

Xingyue was a bit confused. Was it my fault? But... you didn't say anything!

Su Yu looked at her and smiled again, "Of course, it's all trivial. I'm alive now, so I'm here to explain things to you! This time, I opened the Great Dao of Life and Death and opened the heavens all for your revival, my lord!"

Su Yu sighed, "After all, you're my superior. When I have good news, shouldn't I come to you first?"

"I brought Hetu as a guinea pig to revive him first!"

"If Hetu dies, so be it. But you, my lord, mustn't die!"

Su Yu chuckled, "So this time, I specifically came to inform you, to avoid you causing me any more trouble..."

As he spoke, he looked at Xingyue and frowned, "Can't you understand my feelings, my lord? Sigh, then I spoke in vain!"

"Fine, I'll leave then..."

He turned to leave, but Xingyue was furious. Damn you! You sealed me! What do you want me to say?

Just as Su Yu was about to leave, Xingyue's seal disappeared, and she shouted angrily, "Where are you going?"

Su Yu turned back, looking innocent, "Aren't you ignoring me, my lord?"

"…"

Xingyue wanted to strangle him! She was annoyed and snorted, "Shut up! When I speak, it's not your place to interrupt!"

Then, curious, she asked, "What do you mean by opening the heavens?"

"…"

Su Yu almost laughed but quickly became serious, "It's about opening a separate Great Dao of Life and Death. I made myself a death spirit, trying to revive myself, all to prepare for your revival, my lord!"

"Separate?"

Xingyue was stunned, "Separate... what do you mean?"

"It means opening a path in chaos, not relying on the River of Time!"

"Huh?"

Xingyue was shocked, "Then... then you became a death spirit?"

Su Yu nodded, "I became a death spirit. It was then that you sent me death energy..."

"No!"

Xingyue hurriedly said, "At that time, you seemed to suddenly disappear, as if your power was exhausted. I saw you had no power left, so I... I only sent you a little death energy. I didn't expect it to be like this... I didn't mean to..."

Su Yu sighed, "It's fine, I almost really died. But dying and becoming a death spirit isn't bad, right, my lord?"

Xingyue looked even more aggrieved and quickly said, "I really didn't mean to..."

"Forget it!"

Su Yu smiled, "I forgive you, my lord. After all, as subordinates, we must give our superiors face."

Xingyue was extremely frustrated. What subordinate? This liar, this guy is now terrifyingly powerful, with a bunch of strong subordinates, yet he keeps pretending to be a subordinate, shameless!

Su Yu's smile was bright, "My lord, so the previous matter is settled?"

Xingyue glanced at him, feeling something was off, but she couldn't pinpoint what it was! She felt annoyed and stifled, muttering, "Fine, I won't argue with you!"

Su Yu chuckled and quickly said, "Alright, then there's nothing more to say! One more thing, my lord, you seem to be sealed by someone. You were probably strong in life and not weak in death, but someone sealed you. Before reviving you, I might need to unseal you first!"

Xingyue grumbled, "Sealed? Which bastard did it?"

"The Culture King!"

Xingyue was stunned, the Culture King?

Su Yu smiled, "That's right! The Culture King deliberately sealed you, so no matter how many death spirit imprints you devour, you can't grow stronger!"

"The bastard is the Culture King?"

Xingyue couldn't help but curse, "So that's it! I wondered why I haven't grown stronger in a hundred thousand years, and it's all because of him! Bastard!"

Too much!

The next moment, she asked, "Why did he seal me?"

Su Yu laughed, "Maybe he wanted to revive you, but couldn't, so he thought... let's seal you first. Such a person is too irresponsible, right?"

Xingyue nodded, indeed irresponsible! If you can't revive me, at least unseal me! Bastard!

Su Yu continued, "So, since I'm going to revive you, I must be prepared before doing so. I won't be like the Culture King, sealing you without a second thought!"

"Have you ever thought about it? Ten thousand years—no, the seal has been in place for more than ten thousand years. All this time, your strength hasn't been able to improve. If you were killed by a death spirit, wouldn't that be a waste?"

Xingyue nodded, feeling indignant. "Yes, it's infuriating! The Culture King is so unreliable!"

"Then... why did the Culture King awaken me?" Xingyue asked, puzzled.

Su Yu shrugged with a smile. "Who knows? Maybe he has his eyes on the Starry Sky Seal? The Culture King is truly not a good person!"

"......"

Xingyue felt there was something off about Su Yu's words but decided to let it go and not argue with him.

"Can I really be revived?" Xingyue hesitated.

"It's hard to say, but there's a good chance!" Su Yu replied with a grin. "I'll be prepared to rescue you again. I've moved the Culture King's entire residence to the Death Realm. It's full of flowers. Once you're revived, you can stay there for a while. Fat Ball should welcome you!"

"Flowers?" Xingyue nodded. "In my memory, there were indeed many flowers. The Time Sage used to plant them, and I taught her how..."

Really? Su Yu was speechless. You're truly ancient and idle, teaching someone to plant flowers. Poor Fat Ball has been planting flowers for over ten thousand years without a break. How pitiful!

So, the real culprit is right here!

"Lord, I'll take my leave now. If you're interested, you can visit the research institute..."

"No, I prefer staying here!" Xingyue declined, though she was somewhat interested.

Su Yu chuckled. Such a recluse! Oh well, Xingyue hasn't ventured out much over the years, except for that one time at the Luminous Domain Mansion to save me.

"Alright then, I'll be off. I'll report back on the progress next time!"

Xingyue reluctantly nodded, maintaining her dignity. "You may leave!"

"Thank you, Lord!" Su Yu withdrew.

Soon, the ancient castle of Xingyue reopened. Xingyue, in a good mood, decided not to shut herself away anymore. Instead, she went to tend to her flowers and plants. She hadn't taken care of them for several days, thanks to that rascal who almost caused her to neglect them to death.

Forget it, considering he's preparing for my revival, I won't hold it against him!

With a joyful heart, Xingyue continued to care for her death flowers.

Outside, the death spirits observed silently, feeling helpless.

Isn't the Lord too fickle? Just a moment ago, she was angry, and now, after a few words from the Grand Commander, she's fine?

Indeed, the Grand Commander is impressive!

P.S.: I was dragged out for a meal by a big shot this afternoon, so I returned a bit late. Apologies!
