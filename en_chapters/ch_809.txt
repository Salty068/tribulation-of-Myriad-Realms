Chapter 809: King Meets King, A Complete Victory! (Seeking Subscriptions)

"Hahaha!"

The heavens and earth trembled, the River of Time was severed, and the aura of the Martial Emperor enveloped the world at this moment. His long hair fluttered, and a golden armor appeared. If only... if only he had more hair, he would look even more dashing and explosive.

Unfortunately, he was a bit bald.

The Martial Emperor probably hadn't noticed this detail! Nor did he have the mind to care about it. Additionally, his legs were slightly... slightly splayed. It's unavoidable; if you were forced into a split for hundreds of thousands of years, you'd have splayed legs too! Bald head, splayed legs, and a slightly crooked neck—yes, his neck had been broken and buried underground, so it was a bit crooked.

His aura was explosive, his armor dazzling, and his laughter wild...

Everything was perfect!

If you didn't look at the person, you'd have to marvel at what a Martial Emperor he was, unparalleled and domineering! But upon seeing him... what a Martial Emperor, meeting him was not as impressive as hearing about him, truly disappointing!

Of course, in this era, strength is what matters, not looks. A powerhouse like Su Yu, who combines handsomeness, talent, wisdom, courage, dominance, and decisiveness, is a rare sight!

This was Su Yu's own thought.

At this moment, he stood proudly within the River of Time, hands behind his back, silently watching the Martial Emperor's wild laughter. He didn't find anything particularly domineering about it!

Having witnessed the most embarrassing moment of the Martial Emperor, Su Yu didn't think much of his powerful aura. Yes, the Martial Emperor was strong! At this moment, he might truly be the strongest in the Myriad Realms, and this could be seen from the comparison with the Divine Consort in the River of Time. There was indeed a gap.

At this moment, the Divine Consort's aura was also strong, but it seemed slightly weaker than that of Yu Qing, who was much weaker than the Martial Emperor. That was the feeling!

This time, Su Yu had a clear comparison. Indeed, the rulers of laws were on different levels. It's hard to distinguish by realm at the level of a ruler of laws; it depends on the length of the Dao, the width of the Dao, the characteristics of the Dao, and the rules.

Everyone has mastered a power of the Dao. A ruler of laws with a Dao as wide as a urethra is still a ruler of laws. But compared to a ruler of laws with a Dao as vast as the sea, it's like the difference between heaven and earth.

Therefore, rulers of laws can't be easily classified by level. It's about the overall strength and the strength of the Dao, and the Martial Emperor was clearly much stronger than the Divine Consort.

Su Yu had actually encountered the Martial Emperor's Dao before. From his perspective, the width was decent, about 4,000 meters, stronger than the Dao of the Desolate Beast. Among the Daos Su Yu had seen, excluding some special Daos, it was only weaker than the pen dao.

The Martial Emperor was undoubtedly a powerhouse. There's no doubt about it. If he wasn't a powerhouse, he wouldn't have the qualifications to fight against the Martial King and others.

However... the Martial Emperor had fallen on hard times, and Su Yu didn't really treat him as a supreme powerhouse. But at this moment, the Martial Emperor was still quite domineering.

As he regained his strength and laughed wildly, his brows furrowed, and he coldly shouted, "Scram!"

It wasn't directed at Su Yu, but at the Divine Consort.

The Martial Emperor's aura was rampant as he coldly looked at the Divine Consort, a member of the Divine Race! Borrowing the opportunity of his unsealing to extend her Dao.

If he hadn't known that Su Yu had tacitly agreed to it earlier, he would have killed this person who was basking in his glory!

In the distance, the Divine Consort's aura was strong, yet at this moment, it had a sense of competing with the sun and moon. After a moment of silence, the Divine Consort slightly bowed and instantly disappeared from the spot.

The Martial Emperor, she couldn't match.

Although the Martial Emperor was arrogant, he had the capital to be so.

Provoking the Martial Emperor at this moment was clearly unwise.

The Divine Consort disappeared, and the Martial Emperor didn't pay her any mind. Instead, he looked at Su Yu, his gaze cold and his aura violently oppressive as he walked step by step towards Su Yu. His aura was overwhelmingly powerful as he coldly said, "Su Yu!"

This guy had humiliated him multiple times.

Now, he had broken free!

In today's Myriad Realms, who else but me!

The Martial Emperor was well aware, even though he had been sealed for many years, even though he couldn't match the Culture King and others, in this era of seals, he was the undisputed king!

Otherwise, he wouldn't have dared to promise Su Yu to kill three rulers of laws!

That was confidence and self-assurance!

The Martial Emperor, with his violent aura, stepped on the River of Time, approaching Su Yu step by step. He wanted to see if Su Yu still had the confidence to be arrogant with him now!

No matter how talented you are, you're still not as good as me now!

And not far away, Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "If your legs are healed, pay attention to your gait, it's a bit splayed, try to keep it in."

"......"

The Martial Emperor's face turned icy, "Su Yu, this is not the time for jokes!"

Do you know?

The world has changed!

Su Yu smiled again, "Don't let your neck tilt, pay a little attention!"

The Martial Emperor's face turned ashen, his legs slightly closed, and his neck slightly adjusted.

He continued to approach Su Yu!

You're courting death!

Su Yu smiled again, "Also, you're a bit short on hair!"

"Bastard!"

A furious roar pierced through the heavens and earth.

If he hadn't mentioned it, it would have been fine, but bringing it up enraged the Martial Emperor. Su Yu had once plucked his hair!

The Martial Emperor was furious!

His hair instantly became lush, and on the golden armor, there was a faint trace of fresh blood, his blood boiling. In the past, he was also a figure who fought against the heavens and earth, who had killed rulers of laws!

Such a peerless powerhouse, yet Su Yu was still humiliating him at this moment.

Su Yu chuckled, "Just a reminder, no need to get angry, it's not good for your heart!"

"You're courting death!"

The Martial Emperor's voice was cold and sharp, "Do you think that by unsealing me, I will truly stand by your side? Do you think that just because you have more people under you, you can do anything to me? You underestimate me too much! Moreover, you are at odds with Hundred Battle, with Yu Qing, with the Myriad Races... Su Yu, your enemies are all over the world, and you still dare to be so arrogant!"

Where do you get the qualification?

Where do you get the confidence?

The Martial Emperor was puzzled. Su Yu had many enemies, yet at this moment, he wasn't trying to win him over but was instead mocking him. Did he really not know the meaning of death?

Su Yu chuckled softly, "Even if the heavens and earth are against me, I will do as I please. If I look down on you, I will still look down on you! You, who opened the Heaven Gate, have been sealed for over a hundred thousand years, and now, borrowing my power to break free, do you feel proud that you can suppress me? Let me think... I'm 22 years old this year, do you feel proud?"

The Martial Emperor's steps faltered.

Su Yu's expression remained unchanged, still smiling, "Not to mention whether you can kill me, even if you can, how long do you think you'll live after killing me?"

Su Yu's smile was radiant, "This world doesn't need a disruptor! And you, are the disruptor I released!"

The Martial Emperor's expression changed slightly.

"So what if you're the number one in the world? The more you're number one, the more you need to die!"

Su Yu's smile gradually faded, "Martial Emperor, do you want to be unsealed today and fall today? Do you believe that if I call out, Hundred Battle, the Divine Consort, the Undead Emperor, and even Yu Qing, they would all be willing to help me kill you?"

The Martial Emperor's expression changed, "Impossible! They have grudges with you, not me..."

Su Yu sneered, "Naive thinking! Because... you're the number one in the world!"

The Martial Emperor was stunned.

"The number one in the world, if you don't die, who will?"

Su Yu said indifferently, "Can I kill a ruler of laws? Can I kill one alone? No! But you... you might be able to kill! So, are the rulers of laws more afraid of you or me? Even if I can kill, it's through encirclement, siege, and even with heavy losses! But you, since you have the ability to kill a ruler of laws, you are the public enemy. Don't you understand this logic?"

Su Yu's voice grew cold, "Why are you always so foolish!"

The Martial Emperor's face turned ashen!

"Su Yu, have you got me figured out? Since you're willing to cooperate with me, others would be willing too!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Yes, you can try. I won't stop you. Right now, Hundred Battle is in the Human Realm. Go ask him if he's willing to cooperate with you!"

The Martial Emperor's expression changed.

Should he go?

Should he ask?

Su Yu was too arrogant!

He coldly glanced at Su Yu, then suddenly tore through the River of Time and disappeared instantly.

Su Yu watched him leave with a calm expression. Go ahead, if Hundred Battle accepts you, I'll call you dad!

You're someone I released!

Hundred Battle would have to be out of his mind to accept you!

What an idiot!

Aren't you afraid it's intentional on my part?

Aren't you afraid I'm planting a spy?

There's even Yue Luo on Hundred Battle's side, he himself has planted someone, isn't he afraid Su Yu would plant the Martial Emperor in there?

Moreover, the Martial Emperor is incredibly powerful, aren't they afraid of him taking over?

Ridiculous!

...

At this moment, in the Human Realm.

The heavens and earth were torn apart.

A powerful aura shook the heavens and earth, and Hundred Battle frowned, while others were on high alert.

The Martial Emperor!

In the next moment, a golden figure appeared, no longer as wretched as before. The Martial Emperor was now unparalleled and domineering, his powerful aura covering the heavens and earth, causing some Daofuse cultivators to feel suffocated!

The Martial Emperor stepped out of the void, looked at Hundred Battle, and coldly said, "Not weak!"

Hundred Battle also looked at him, somewhat serious, but soon smiled, "Martial Emperor, senior!"

"Cut the crap!"

The Martial Emperor coldly said, "You are also of the Human Race, and so am I. I have deep grievances with Su Yu. If I cooperate with you to kill Su Yu, would you be willing?"

Hundred Battle was taken aback, then quickly chuckled, "Senior, you must be joking. Daoist Su is also of the Human Race. How could we do such a thing... Senior, please don't joke."

What a joke!

This guy, isn't he deliberately causing trouble?

No wonder Su Yu's attitude changed drastically today. It turns out the Martial Emperor was unsealed, giving him confidence.

Indeed, the Martial Emperor is very strong.

As for killing Su Yu... he didn't take it seriously.

Haha!

What a joke!

If he agreed now, saying he wanted to kill Su Yu, the Martial Emperor would most likely attack him immediately. Hundred Battle found it amusing. Was this the Martial Emperor's own idea, or was it Su Yu directing the Martial Emperor to do this?

Naturally, the Martial Emperor was Su Yu's man!

That's a given!

Who in the Myriad Realms doesn't think so?

If he wasn't Su Yu's man, would Su Yu help him unseal?

Would he draw upon the Human Race's fortune to break the Human Emperor's suppression?

That's impossible!

Would Su Yu be foolish enough to release an enemy to join forces with others to kill himself?

What a joke!

Martial Emperor furrowed his brows slightly, his voice cold as he said, "Hundred Battle, you fool. Do you really think I would be one of Su Yu's people? That I would listen to him? I have a deep-seated grudge against him. He is strong, with many powerful subordinates. If you and I join forces to kill him, I will help you quell the chaos in the Myriad Realms!"

Hundred Battle chuckled, "Senior, we are all part of the Human Race. There's no need for that! I have no enmity with Daoist Su."

"Hypocrite!" Martial Emperor roared in anger. "He talks about killing you every day, and you don't want to kill him?"

At that moment, the void trembled, and Su Yu's figure appeared between heaven and earth, hands behind his back. He looked across the distance and said calmly, "Enough. You're getting old. Go back and rest."

Martial Emperor turned around in fury, cursing, "Su Yu, you scoundrel! Today, I will join forces with Hundred Battle to kill you..."

Hundred Battle interrupted with a smile, "Senior, why not rest with Daoist Su for a while? You've just broken the seal, and you've expended a lot of energy."

He almost wanted to say, "Stop acting. Aren't you tired?"

Even if you curse him, or even beat Su Yu half to death, I won't intervene. If I do... ha, you two will immediately turn on me, right?

Hundred Battle was speechless!

What exactly does Su Yu want?

Is he looking for an excuse to pick a fight, or does he want to completely break ties with me while Martial Emperor is unsealed?

He pondered.

Martial Emperor's face was ashen. The next moment, he cursed, "You fool!"

Stupid Hundred Battle!

If Hundred Battle had truly joined forces with him at this moment... perhaps Martial Emperor would really have attacked Su Yu. To be honest, he was still very angry at Su Yu for repeatedly humiliating him.

But Hundred Battle is just an idiot!

I'm so angry!

Forget it, working with such an idiot would only lead to being tricked by Su Yu.

Foolish creature!

Martial Emperor cursed inwardly for a while, then turned his head to look at Su Yu, snorted coldly, and tore through the void to leave!

Behind him, Su Yu chuckled, "Martial Emperor, don't run around. Even if you are the number one in the heavens, you may not be safe in the Myriad Realms! Don't go to Chaos, lest you encounter my nephew Zhou Ji and get killed. Don't blame me for not warning you!"

Martial Emperor ignored him and vanished directly!

He wanted to see the world. It had been over a hundred thousand years since he last saw it, and he was feeling very stifled. He didn't want to deal with Su Yu. Whatever it was, it could wait until he had seen the world.

Su Yu also ignored him, turning his gaze to Hundred Battle.

Last time, they hadn't met in the River of Time.

This time, however, they were face to face. The so-called "kings do not meet" depended on the situation!

At this moment, Su Yu wanted to meet Hundred Battle.

He stood between heaven and earth, looking towards the Eastern Rift Valley, towards that familiar place, and chuckled, "Brother Hundred Battle, Martial Emperor is reckless. Don't take it to heart! He's been sealed by the Martial King for over a hundred thousand years and has become a bit twisted!"

"Martial Emperor is a senior. Naturally, I won't hold it against him," Hundred Battle replied with a light laugh. "Daoist Su, are you planning to return to the Human Realm?"

Su Yu smiled, "What if I say I am?"

"Then I will yield the Human Realm to you..."

Behind him, someone frowned.

Su Yu also frowned slightly, saying calmly, "Is the Human Race not worth Brother Hundred Battle staying for?"

Hundred Battle laughed, "That's for others. Since it's Daoist Su, I think it won't be a problem."

Su Yu said flatly, "Then I also want the Giant Race!"

Hundred Battle furrowed his brows, looking at Su Yu, and after a moment of silence, said, "The Giant Race... even if you take it, it won't be of use."

Su Yu nodded, "I understand."

He said nothing more, just a simple "I understand."

In simple terms, Hundred Battle could give up the Human Realm, but he didn't want to give up the Giant Race.

At this moment, someone behind Hundred Battle changed color slightly, and Hundred Battle quickly realized that Su Yu might be setting a trap. He laughed again, "The Giant Race... you know, it's my wife's clan... As for the Human Race, you are the tenth Human Lord. I think if you truly want to return, no one will stop you... If they do, wouldn't that lead to conflict? We are all part of the Human Race, there's no need for that!"

I'm doing this for the Human Race, for righteousness, to give you a place to stay. It's not because I'm afraid of you, nor because I don't want the Human Race anymore.

Su Yu nodded slightly and continued, "The situation in the Myriad Realms is chaotic. We are both part of the Human Race. We can discuss matters together!"

Su Yu continued, "Now, our common enemies are none other than the Sin Clan and the Myriad Races!"

"Sin Clan?"

"The Control King's throne has been stripped by me, recognized by heaven and earth, permitted by the Human Emperor, and abandoned by the Human Race!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "I have announced to the heavens in the Upper Realm. The Human Race should know, the strong should know. Brother Hundred Battle, do you know nothing?"

Are you not part of the Human Race?

Are you not strong?

How could you not know?

Hundred Battle raised his eyebrows slightly, smiling, "I know a little, but I didn't know... that you declared them the Sin Clan..."

Su Yu laughed, "Is the Control King without sin? Are the descendants of the Control King without sin? Moon Luo and Moon Xiao are under your command. Are they without sin? Does Moon Luo not know? Not to mention anything else, just sitting by and watching the Human Race be oppressed by the Myriad Races for a hundred thousand years, this is a great sin!"

Su Yu's voice resonated through the heavens, "As part of the Human Race, sitting by and watching eight generations of Human Lords fall, this is a monstrous crime! Watching the descendants of the Martial King fall, this is unforgivable! Was the Martial King meritorious or at fault? Was the descendant of the Martial King, a generation of Human Lord, meritorious or at fault? If this is not a sin, then the extinction of the Human Race is not a sin either! In their position, they should fulfill their duties! Sharing the fortune of the Human Race, how can they sit by and watch the decline of the Human Race? Not appearing for a hundred thousand years, and when they do, there are two rulers of laws, seven or eight Heavenly Venerables, more than ten Heavenly Kings, and nearly a hundred Daofuse... Don't tell me this is the accumulation of six thousand years!"

Su Yu's voice thundered, "If six thousand years of accumulation results in such strength, then for a hundred thousand years, was the Human Race all useless?"

His thunderous voice shook the four directions.

Is the Control King's lineage guilty?

Hundred Battle said nothing. Su Yu said they were guilty, and without saying anything else, just sitting by and watching the decline of the Human Race, watching eight generations of Human Lords fall, that is a sin!

Watching nearly a hundred ancient Human Race marquises fall, that is also a sin!

He didn't mention anything about the Culture King's lineage being targeted, as that was unrelated to others.

Nor did he mention colluding with the undead, as Su Yu was also doing that.

Just this one point, watching the great battle from the sidelines, is an unforgivable sin!

Hundred Battle looked at him deeply and nodded slightly, "The Sin Clan... is indeed guilty!"

He had to acknowledge it!

Even if Su Yu was... speaking in a roundabout way!

Watching from the sidelines for a hundred thousand years was the Control King's lineage, the six thousand years was his lineage!

Such a young age, yet so meticulous and dark-hearted.

Under the witness of the heavens, how could Hundred Battle deny the guilt of the Control King's lineage?

The stripping of the Control King's throne was the best proof. Su Yu had won the people's hearts, and when he said to strip it, it was stripped!

And Su Yu did not stop there, once again speaking loudly, "The Sin Clan and the Myriad Races are the enemies of our Human Race. Does Brother Hundred Battle agree?"

"I agree!"

Hundred Battle nodded slightly, and at that moment, someone suddenly said in a low voice, "Then Su... Su Human Lord, why did you help the Divine Empress break the seal?"

What kind of crime is this?

Su Yu's offensive was obvious, and Hundred Battle found it difficult to bring it up, so someone helped him!

Su Yu, you say the Myriad Races are the enemy, yet you are helping the enemy!

Su Yu's voice was like a great bell, "Using barbarians to control barbarians! The Divine Empress is my great enemy, but the Divine Empress..."

Su Yu turned and shouted, "I helped you break the seal, I ask for nothing in return. You said you would agree to one condition. My request is not high, kill Moon Battle, and this transaction is over!"

At this moment, from the direction of the Divine Realm, the Divine Empress was silent for a moment, then her voice spread, "I remember Emperor Yu's words! With Moon Battle's death, I will repay the favor of helping me break the seal..."

Su Yu no longer paid attention, turning to look at the person who spoke, saying indifferently, "If I don't help her break the seal, she still has hope of breaking it. Now, she will kill Moon Battle, and Control Qing will surely stop her. Perhaps, she will kill more than just Moon Battle, perhaps she will perish together with Control Qing... Is this a loss or a gain?"

The person who spoke said softly, "Then how can Su Human Lord guarantee that she will go to kill?"

Su Yu said indifferently, "If she doesn't kill Moon Battle, within half a year, I will kill her! If she doesn't die, I will give up this position of Human Lord to you, how about that?"

Su Yu took a step forward, shouting coldly, "Just ask you one thing, do you dare to take it?"

The person stepped back, their face slightly pale.

It wasn't Longbrow, Longbrow didn't dare to speak at this moment, it was Hundred Battle's advisor, Changqing.

Su Yu's voice was like a great bell, "I dare to make such a promise, do you dare?"

Su Yu's voice was like the sound of the Great Dao, shouting, "You have subdued Moon Luo, Moon Xiao, subdued the Sin Clan, with no achievements, dare you say, within three months, you will kill Control Qing, if Control Qing doesn't die, will you end yourself here?"

"Moon Luo, Moon Xiao, these rebels, can they be subdued with just a word of surrender?"

Su Yu scolded, "Then if Control returns, with just a word of knowing their mistake, can they be forgiven? If Control can be forgiven, then if the rulers of laws of the Myriad Races return, with a word that they are willing to continue respecting the Human Race, can they be forgiven?"

"If all can be forgiven, then what has the war been for over the past hundred thousand years?"

"Whether it's the Divine Race or the Myriad Races, today's cooperation is just to use barbarians to control barbarians!"

Su Yu spoke frankly, shouting loudly, "It's not about forgiving for the sake of forgiving, it's not that they can say a word of surrender to me, Su Yu, and be without sin! I have accepted the Iron Devourer, Fate Clan, Space Ancient Beast Race, Hou Race, all are friends of the Human Race! None have blood debts with the Human Race! All are without sin!"

"In the time of the Human Race's peril, they still stood on the side of the Human Race, shedding blood for us. I can accept them. Do the Myriad Races also want to surrender to me, Su Yu?"

Su Yu shouted, "Even if I could lie and say I can accept people from the Myriad Races, saying such a thing, the Divine Empress might be willing to surrender to me, Su Yu. But for the sake of a ruler of laws, can I forget the blood feud? The Human Race's tide this time, the war has lasted five hundred years, with over ten million, even over a hundred million soldiers dead! Can I accept these executioners for the sake of a ruler of laws?"

The Myriad Realms were silent!

"Even if the Myriad Races are my enemies, so what?"

Su Yu's voice grew louder, "A sea of blood and deep hatred, can it be forgotten just because the other side is strong, surrenders to me, and my strength increases, so I can accept them?"

Is this false?

It's not false!

Those with a sea of blood and deep hatred with the Human Race, Su Yu has never accepted any.

In the vast expanse of the Myriad Realms, Su Yu stood firm, his voice echoing across the heavens. The factions he had allied with bore no grudges against the Human Realm; they were either neutral races or former allies who had leaned towards humanity. As for the undead, Su Yu paid them no mind. They had been dead for countless years, and who knew if they bore any grudges against humanity?

With each question he posed, the world grew silent. After a long pause, Hundred Battle King spoke softly, “What you say is true. Those with deep-seated enmity against humanity cannot be accepted. As for Yue Luo and Yue Xiao... they have always aided the Human Realm, probing the Sin Clan’s weaknesses and delaying their advances, preventing them from encircling us.”

At this point, further questioning from Su Yu would seem like nitpicking. Though tempted, he chose not to dwell on it. Instead, he declared loudly, “Since you worry about my ties with the myriad races, and I worry about your connections with the Sin Clan, why don’t we divide our efforts? You suppress the myriad races, and I’ll handle the Sin Clan!”

Su Yu laughed, “The Ninth and Tenth Human Lords, uniting the Myriad Realms! Living in harmony and defending against our enemies together would be a tale worth telling! Brother Hundred Battle, perhaps we could even compete to see who subdues their foes first! The chaos of the heavens began with humanity and will end with humanity! The myriad races have one ruler of laws and several Heavenly Venerables, while the Sin Clan has two rulers of laws, with Yue Zhan and Mo Tian being quite formidable... In this way, I’m not taking advantage of you, Brother Hundred Battle. What do you think?”

Hundred Battle’s expression shifted slightly, as did those of the others around him. Su Yu was pushing him into a corner, forcing a decision. Before the entire Myriad Realms, with all of humanity listening, Su Yu was not aggressive but rather assertive, using the power he had accumulated over the years to challenge the Control King’s faction of rulers of laws. Meanwhile, Hundred Battle’s task was merely to deal with the myriad races, whom Su Yu had already weakened. Was it a loss?

Not at all!

Would Hundred Battle agree or not?

Su Yu continued, “Under Brother Hundred Battle’s command, you have a wealth of talent: eight Heavenly Venerables, you and your nephew Zhou Ji, both rulers of laws, two rulers of laws, eight Heavenly Venerables, over ten Heavenly Kings, and dozens of Daofuse cultivators... more than enough to handle the myriad races! Overwhelming strength!”

At this moment, the heavens were shaken. Was Hundred Battle truly this powerful? Even the Divine Consort in the Divine Realm was taken aback.

Just as Hundred Battle was about to speak, Su Yu chuckled, “Dozens of Daofuse cultivators paving the way for Brother Hundred Battle, the first in ten thousand years, and with Yue Luo’s plan of a false seal six thousand years ago, you could rival the ancient Human King. Now, you should be even stronger than the Martial Emperor, right? As for your nephew Zhou Ji... has he not reached the level of a ruler of laws?”

He only gave Hundred Battle the chance to deny Zhou Ji’s strength. As for Hundred Battle himself, if he claimed not to have the strength of a ruler of laws, he would be a laughingstock! Six thousand years ago, he could rival the Human King, and he was in cahoots with Yue Luo in a false seal. Could he have made no progress at all? If so, being the first in ten thousand years would be a joke!

Hundred Battle looked deeply at Su Yu and said calmly, “I haven’t seen Ji’er in a long time, so I’m not sure of his strength. However, with the current seal on the Myriad Realms, even with great talent, it’s difficult to reach the level you mentioned.”

Su Yu laughed heartily, “Indeed! Even if Nephew Zhou Ji isn’t a ruler of laws, Brother Hundred Battle, is there any difficulty in dealing with the myriad races? If there is, I can support you with some Daofuse cultivators to help quell the chaos! They are all from our Human Realm, strong cultivators born in this tide! Because Brother Hundred Battle is too strong, the path of the physical body was blocked, and no one could enter the Daofuse Realm. I had to find another way, and only recently did I help them enter the Daofuse Realm through other paths. Brother Hundred Battle, don’t disdain them for being too weak!”

Su Yu declared loudly, “They are not like you all, with severed inheritances, forced to walk the path of the physical body! As a result, the path was sealed, with no inheritance, no foundation, and they are not old, growing strong through battle! Over the past five hundred years, they have killed countless enemies and died in droves, only producing a few Eternals. I had no choice but to force them to abandon the path of the physical body and switch paths to enter the Daofuse Realm... don’t disdain their strength!”

A hearty laugh spread across the heavens!

Don’t disdain my people for being weak, because... it’s your fault!

Sealing the path of the physical body, severing the ancient inheritance, unable to enter the Daofuse Realm! Only now, with Su Yu’s help, have they barely entered the Daofuse Realm. Is it difficult?

Too difficult!

This is a history of blood and tears!

At this moment, behind Hundred Battle, some hung their heads in shame, unable to meet Su Yu’s gaze! If these words were left unsaid, it would be fine, but once spoken, in front of the myriad races, anyone with a shred of shame would be overwhelmed with guilt!

At this moment, every word from Su Yu pierced the heart!

Su Yu shouted again, “Brother Hundred Battle, is there any difficulty in dealing with the myriad races? Or do you refuse to cooperate with me, thinking my strength too low, unworthy?”

Hundred Battle was silent for a moment. Beside him, Evergreen, seeing Hundred Battle’s hesitation, quickly said, “Human Lord Su, this matter requires careful consideration...”

Su Yu roared, “Are you the Human Lord, or is Hundred Battle? Are you overstepping your bounds? Brother Hundred Battle, are you willing or not? Give a clear answer! If unwilling, I alone will face the myriad races and the Sin Clan! For six thousand years, the Human Realm has relied only on itself! For six thousand years, with no one to aid us, the Human Realm still stands!”

With that, Su Yu shouted, “If unwilling, I only ask Brother Hundred Battle not to be a hindrance! I will bear the blood feud and hatred of the Human Realm!”

Hundred Battle sighed deeply in his heart!

Su Yu... Su Yu!

What a Su Yu!

In front of everyone, speaking like this, how could he respond? How could he refuse?

Hundred Battle was caught in a dilemma!

Indeed, Su Yu had cornered him. This was their first meeting, and Su Yu was both forceful and domineering!

If he agreed, he would have to block the myriad races. If he didn’t, he would be seen as untrustworthy, a traitor to his race... and his strong followers might truly leave him!

Blocking the myriad races, Su Yu’s side had the Martial Emperor, Su Yu, and multiple Heavenly Venerables. Could they kill Control King’s faction?

The possibility was high!

But if he didn’t agree... how could he refuse?

Consider it carefully?

Hundred Battle knew that at this moment, he had to agree. However, after thinking it over, he said softly, “Under my command, Yue Luo and Yue Xiao understand the Sin Clan better. Why don’t I handle the Sin Clan...”

“Fine!”

“...”

Hundred Battle was stunned!

Su Yu declared loudly, “I have no objections. Brother Hundred Battle, as you wish! Since you say you understand the Sin Clan better, I trust you can suppress them before the Gate of Hell!”

He didn’t care who Hundred Battle suppressed, as long as he agreed, Su Yu would quickly dismantle one alliance! If he agreed and failed... he would be seen as incompetent, or worse, deliberately so!

Su Yu declared loudly, “Since Brother Hundred Battle has chosen to suppress the Sin Clan, this is your choice... Together, we will face external threats, and the Human Realm will surely triumph! The glory of the Human Realm lies in this era! Since Brother Hundred Battle has chosen, and claims to understand the Sin Clan, I trust there won’t be any interference from the Sin Clan or those beyond the Gate of Hell when I deal with the myriad races?”

“...”

Silence!

Absolute silence!

At this moment, Hundred Battle knew he was trapped!

He was silent for a moment before saying calmly, “Of course not!”

In that case, let Su Yu deal with the myriad races. As for the Sin Clan... I’ll handle them!

He said calmly, “Of course! However, as your elder, if you subdue the myriad races first, please don’t rush to aid me... After all, I’d like to maintain some dignity...”

If you defeat the myriad races, just don’t interfere with me!

Su Yu laughed heartily, “How could I? I’m waiting for Brother Hundred Battle to come to my aid! How about this: within three months, we’ll both suppress our respective foes. I think a battle between strong cultivators is instantaneous, no need for three months. If possible, we could start now! However, I see Brother Hundred Battle might need some rest, having been inactive for six thousand years, perhaps not yet accustomed to battle. Take some time to recuperate, and in three months, the Myriad Realms will belong to the Human Realm!”

At this moment, within the Human Realm, a roar erupted!

“In three months, the heavens will belong to the Human Realm!”

“The Human Realm alone!”

“The Human Realm alone!”

The roar shook the heavens, stirring the hearts of all!

Two generations of Human Lords, joining forces to slay the myriad races and traitors, was a heartening prospect!

“Emperor Yu is wise, Hundred Battle King is wise!”

The roar rose again!

At this moment, the thirty-six prefectures, led by thirty-six prefects and countless citizens, shouted loudly, their voices echoing across the heavens!

Within three months!

They didn’t care whether Hundred Battle agreed or not; it wasn’t necessary. When Su Yu spoke those words, some already knew what to do!

Delay?

There would be no delay!

Hundred Battle remained silent.

Behind him, among the strong cultivators, some were excited, some were worried, some frowned, and some were uneasy.

This day was no longer Hundred Battle’s day.

This day was no longer the day of six thousand years ago!

Su Yu had won!

Yes, those with discerning eyes could see it. Su Yu had won, a complete victory!

Because Su Yu liked to stand on the moral high ground, suppressing people like Hundred Battle.

Hundred Battle couldn’t resist, couldn’t refuse!

Refusing would mean rebellion.

Hundred Battle closed his eyes, then quickly opened them, looking at Su Yu with a smile, “Then... let it be as Su Daoist wishes!”

Su Yu laughed loudly, “Thank you, Brother Hundred Battle, for your assistance! I am very pleased with this meeting! In three months, we shall meet again in the Human Realm, to showcase the might of the Human Realm and unify the Myriad Realms!”

With that, Su Yu stepped into the air, his white robes like snow, carefree and unrestrained, disappearing into the River of Time in an instant.

At this moment, Hundred Battle watched his departing figure.

Behind him, some were silent, some said nothing, while others felt uncomfortable, muttering, “Your Majesty, then... in three months, we’ll crush the Sin Clan? We might not fear that kid; if he can do it in three months, without the myriad races interfering, we can do it too!”

Wu Ji!

Evergreen tugged at Wu Ji!

Fool!

Did you forget what His Majesty said earlier?

His Majesty’s goal wasn’t to crush Control King’s faction!

Wu Ji chuckled foolishly, but in his heart, he sighed. I know, but... but... I want to fight, I want to crush the Sin Clan!

Your Majesty... perhaps breaking through is also a way out! Why not consider it?

Su Yu is willing to hold back one side, which is a good thing. Your Majesty, do you realize that if you keep refusing, and three months later Su Yu conquers the myriad races while you have not... how are we, your old comrades, supposed to face ourselves?

Wu Ji chuckled foolishly, saying no more.

Su Yu... truly a remarkable person!
