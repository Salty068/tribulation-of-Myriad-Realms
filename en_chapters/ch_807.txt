Chapter 807: Su Yu's Fury

Relying on oneself is better than relying on others—this has always been Su Yu's philosophy, shaped by his upbringing. From a young age, he could only depend on himself and the Book of Time. Liu Wenyan had been crippled, and Bai Feng was too absorbed in his research to be reliable. Initially, Bai Feng's strength was adequate, but after Su Yu reached the Skysoar Realm, Bai Feng could no longer protect him. In truth, even during Su Yu's Nurturing Spirit stage, when the Sun and Moon realm experts attacked, Bai Feng was already unable to shield him.

Later, figures like Nan Wujiang and Yun Chen emerged, but they lacked the closeness that Su Yu shared with Liu Wenyan and Bai Feng, who were both mentors and close friends. Wan Tiansheng and Lantian were comrades on the path of the Great Dao, close but different from Bai Feng and the others.

Of course, Su Yu rarely sought out Bai Feng and the others now. He preferred to let them focus on their research. At Su Yu's current level, Bai Feng's talent was evidently lacking, unable to keep up with the pace. If Bai Feng were to follow Su Yu blindly, he might end up dead by tomorrow.

...

Su Yu didn't dwell on these thoughts. At this moment, he returned to his own world, bringing only a few people with him. However, to be safe, he brought along Fat Ball, Lantian, and Tongtian. That was enough! Tongtian could teleport them away at any time, Lantian could send messages instantly, and Fat Ball was a formidable fighter. All three possessed Heavenly Sovereign-level strength. Even if the Martial Emperor were to be unsealed and suddenly attack, they could still put up a fight, and reinforcements would arrive quickly.

Unsealing the Martial Emperor!

Su Yu pondered this as he once again headed to the Death Realm.

...

In the Death Realm, the Martial Emperor was waiting, feeling somewhat anxious. Would Su Yu return? Even without Su Yu, there was hope for unsealing, but given the current situation, it might take another year or two. The Martial Emperor was impatient; now that his consciousness had returned, a year or two felt like an eternity!

The Martial Emperor was eagerly anticipating. His greatest fear was that Su Yu would decide not to unseal him, leaving him in despair. Giving hope only to snatch it away was the most detestable act.

As the Martial Emperor waited, suddenly, figures appeared in the distance, shooting towards him as a passage opened. The Martial Emperor was slightly startled, then surprised, "Tongtian, you idiot, you've advanced too?"

Silence!

The Martial Emperor rarely cursed, but seeing Tongtian, he couldn't help himself. No, perhaps it was his true feelings. He was probably annoyed by Tongtian's incessant chatter.

Tongtian Hou's expression stiffened for a moment, but he quickly smiled, "Martial Emperor, shouldn't I advance? As the saying goes, thirty years east of the river, thirty years west..."

The Martial Emperor interrupted impatiently, "Even if you become a master of laws, I'd still squash you!" Annoying fellow! He cut Tongtian off, as he talked too much.

Su Yu chuckled, "You've been neighbors for over a hundred thousand years. Why start with insults? You should be the best of friends!"

The Martial Emperor cursed inwardly, and Tongtian remained silent with a smile. Who's friends with whom? That was the thought both shared. Though they'd been neighbors for countless years, their allegiances were different.

The Martial Emperor then noticed Lantian and was surprised, "You've advanced too?"

Lantian smiled faintly, "Yes, thanks to your support back then!"

The Martial Emperor snorted. Support? When Lantian entered the Luminous Domain Mansion, they did have some resonance, but that wasn't support. This guy, once a Sun and Moon realm, had reached this level, surprising and shocking the Martial Emperor.

Tongtian had previously been around the third or second tier, but now he had quickly reached the Heavenly Sovereign level, as had Lantian. And that dog! The Martial Emperor glanced at Fat Ball, who curiously looked back. The Martial Emperor squinted, and Fat Ball showed a hint of confusion. This might be their first face-to-face encounter.

Fat Ball looked for a while and asked, puzzled, "Have I seen you before?"

The Martial Emperor frowned, "Sun-Eating Divine Dog! We've met once! We even fought back then, and you fought with the Culture King. It seems you were cut off from chaos and have rebuilt your path?"

Su Yu was surprised, "You... fought with Fat Ball?"

The Martial Emperor replied indifferently, "What's the matter? This creature should be the Sun-Eating Divine Dog from back then! It might be the last one that hasn't changed its path but remains extremely powerful!"

"What do you mean?" Su Yu was puzzled.

The Martial Emperor frowned, "Aren't you all-knowing? The Hell's Gate was vaguely unsealed several times in ancient times! These powerful beings, including the Wild Beast, escaped from the Hell's Gate! The current chaos can't sustain these creatures. Those who escaped either integrated into the Myriad Realms or chose to survive in chaos, like the Sun-Eating Divine Dog, which should be the last one that didn't change its path!"

Su Yu shook his head slightly, "So, the Martial Emperor means that chaos... has limitations?"

He truly didn't know this. The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon hadn't mentioned it, and among Su Yu's subordinates, only the Tea Plant was a chaos path expert, and it had only barely reached the second tier.

The Martial Emperor found his confidence, realizing there were things Su Yu didn't know. He sneered, "Of course! Chaos has been sealed. Beyond the Hell's Gate is the true era of chaos. Since it's sealed, it means that era has ended! No supreme beings will be born again! When the Hell's Gate was unsealed, many ancient beasts emerged, trying to restore chaos, but they encountered the strongest period of the Human and Myriad Races... You know the result. Those like the Wild Beast who submitted became part of the Myriad Races, while those who didn't were killed. Some, like the Sun-Eating Divine Dog, were eventually turned into watchdogs!"

Fat Ball looked at him curiously, while Su Yu frowned, "So, Fat Ball was indeed a powerful being at the end of the Primordial Era?"

"It should be it!" The Martial Emperor nodded slightly, "The Great Dao has changed, but its essence remains the same. It seems to have been reborn!"

Fat Ball didn't care much about this, but Su Yu was curious about Fat Ball. Last time, the Chaos Dragon had mentioned the Sun-Eating Divine Dog's strength, but Su Yu hadn't paid much attention. Today, hearing the Martial Emperor's words, he realized that even the Martial Emperor had fought with Fat Ball. Given the Martial Emperor's character, if it were too weak, he wouldn't have remembered it, and it would have been killed long ago.

Since Fat Ball wasn't killed and even attracted the Culture King's personal intervention, it was clearly not weak. Yet later, it was subdued... and seemed to have no memory. What was that about?

Su Yu pondered but didn't speculate too much on what happened back then. He simply said, "So you mean that the ancient chaos race can't break through outside the gate?"

"More or less!" The Martial Emperor saw that Su Yu didn't know this and felt pleased, "That's the gist! But this dog changed its path, so it doesn't affect it."

Su Yu nodded slightly. No wonder the Chaos Dragon hadn't become a true master of laws. It seemed it couldn't break through. Their focus on Yu Qing indicated that their so-called chaos will was crucial, a key to breaking through!

Su Yu couldn't use it, but he had someone who could—Tea Plant! Tea Plant, Book Spirit, Big Wood, and Fat Ball were all left by the Culture King. When Su Yu discovered the Culture King's Residence, he had just become the Human Lord, not very strong. Fat Ball and Tea Plant played a stabilizing role during that period.

However, none of them chose to integrate into Su Yu's world. The Book Spirit was the Culture King's book, and perhaps it was better not to integrate. Tea Plant was self-explanatory, and Big Wood was absent-minded. Since Fat Ball and the others didn't integrate, neither did it.

Now, as Su Yu's strength grew, so did his subordinates. Those who played a stabilizing role back then, like Tea Plant, had only recently managed to advance to the second tier, while the Book Spirit was only at the third tier, as was Big Wood. Among Su Yu's forces, they were only third-line existences. There were plenty of Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Sovereigns, many second-tier experts, and third-tier ones weren't particularly valuable.

Hearing that the ancient chaos race found it difficult to break through, Su Yu thought of Yu Qing and Po Long. If Tea Plant and Fat Ball devoured Po Long's true form, the ancient chaos race often strengthened themselves through mutual devouring. If they then consumed the chaos will in Yu Qing's possession, could Tea Plant hope to become a master of laws?

Reciprocating kindness with kindness! Sometimes, it wasn't that Su Yu didn't want to repay, but that he couldn't. Strength often depended on opportunity. Now, the lineage of the Control King was an opportunity for Tea Plant and the others.

Su Yu silently contemplated. As for the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger, they had fled earlier, ending their cooperation. Thus, the conditions Su Yu had previously promised were naturally void.

Soon, Su Yu stopped thinking about it. It was enough to keep it in mind; there was no point in discussing it. He looked at the Martial Emperor, his expression calm, and smiled lightly, "Alright, let's not talk about these meaningless things..."

The Martial Emperor cursed inwardly! What you don't know is meaningless, shameless fellow. However, at this moment, he felt a bit more confident in Su Yu. His subordinates had grown so strong, giving the Martial Emperor a small sense of anticipation...

Even though he might not agree to cooperate with Su Yu.

The Martial Emperor licked his lips, feeling a bit excited, "Did you get the Councilor's Order?"

"Of course!"

Chapter 1: The Gathering Storm

In the vast expanse of the Myriad Realms, a subtle tension hung in the air. Su Yu stood amidst the swirling energies, his gaze fixed on the horizon where the sky met the sea. The Celestial River of Death churned with an intensity that mirrored the turmoil within his heart.

Ninety-seven tokens lay before him, each a testament to the power and authority he now wielded. They were not all the Council Tokens, but they were enough. The remaining two, he suspected, were still with the Ancient Giant Race, but he had no interest in retrieving them. Last time, he had mentioned needing four, and they had promptly delivered, suggesting there were more than he initially thought.

"All the same," he mused. Ninety-seven tokens were sufficient. The Myriad Realms were nearing the point where the power of laws would dissipate. He didn't need every single token to disperse the power of laws across the realms.

"When will you disperse the power of laws?" someone asked.

"Disperse?" Su Yu chuckled. "No, I won't disperse it."

The Martial Emperor's expression shifted. Was Su Yu reneging on his promise?

"I'm going to devour it," Su Yu declared with a smile. "The power of laws is a precious thing. In the past, I was cautious, fearing that taking too much would cause the laws of the Myriad Realms to vanish. But now, since the intention is to disperse them, I might as well consume them all."

The Martial Emperor was indifferent to this. Hearing Su Yu's words, he relaxed. Whether Su Yu dispersed or devoured the power of laws, as long as the restrictions on the Myriad Realms were lifted, it was all the same to him.

"Prepare yourself," the Martial Emperor said. "I'll head to the Death Realm to unseal you. And perhaps, I'll finally see where your true body lies."

As Su Yu contemplated this, Tongtian suddenly interjected, "Your Majesty, someone from the Abyssal Realm is here to see you."

"Who?"

"It's Marquis Lanshan."

Marquis Lanshan? Su Yu was momentarily taken aback. What did he want?

Never mind, Su Yu thought. He couldn't be bothered with it. "Tell him to meet me in the depths of the Sea of Stars, outside the Luminous Domain Mansion."

He had no intention of letting Marquis Lanshan into the Abyssal Realm. It would only complicate matters. If Lanshan discovered something, he might run to Hundred Battle King with a report.

But why was he looking for me? Su Yu wondered. Moon Luo and Moon Xiao should have reached Hundred Battle King by now. Was this about causing trouble for me? If so, it should be Hundred Battle King himself coming.

Forget it, Su Yu decided. He turned to his companions. "Let's take the acupoint passage into the Myriad Realms. I'm not in the mood for a long journey."

They would travel through the Martial Emperor's body. This time, the Martial Emperor had no objections. The faster, the better. His acupoints served as passages, and the Myriad Realms' pathways all led through his acupoints, transporting them into his body.

Soon, Su Yu and his companions entered the Martial Emperor's body. Moments later, they emerged from one of the acupoint portals, transported into the Sea of Stars region.

...

In the Myriad Realms, the Sea of Stars was a place of tumultuous waves and swirling winds. The nearest city had once been Grandstar Ancient City, but it had vanished, leaving the Nine Realms' experts in tears—tears of joy. Their previous attempts to create land had failed, thwarted by Su Yu. But now, with Su Yu gone and Hundred Battle King indifferent, the Nine Realms' experts were once again pouring their efforts into rebuilding the land.

The entrances to the Nine Realms were not far apart. Once, a continent had existed here, but Su Yu had destroyed it. Now, with Su Yu gone, it was time to rebuild.

On the Nine Star Continent, experts from the Nine Realms were busy constructing cities. They were satisfied, some even excited. "In a few days, the Nine Star Continent will be complete! We will finally return to the Myriad Realms!"

It was close. As soon as Su Yu had left, they had begun their work. Two months of labor, countless resources, and manpower had gone into this massive project. In the Myriad Realms, with so many experts, two months was an impressive feat.

"Su Yu, you better not come back!" someone muttered.

As they spoke, a Sun and Moon cultivator from the Nine Realms looked into the distance, puzzled. "Is the tide coming? It shouldn't be. The last tide wasn't long ago."

The tide came every ten years. Each tide opened the Luminous Domain Mansion. The last one had been a turning point, bringing Su Yu to prominence. It had been just over a year since then. The next tide shouldn't come so soon.

"If it comes, it comes. The Myriad Realms are ever-changing. Who knows what might happen... But it's just big waves. It won't affect us much."

"That's true."

The group chatted, unconcerned. The tide was just larger waves, and perhaps some treasures would be swept in. It was a good thing. With fewer experts in the Myriad Realms, it was quieter now. If the Luminous Domain Mansion opened, perhaps no one would come. The Nine Realms were nearby; they might benefit.

However, this tide was growing more intense. The tide was actually the Martial Emperor's cultivation technique in motion. Previously, it had naturally circulated every ten years, sweeping up source qi and causing the Sea of Stars to surge. But now, the Martial Emperor was actively transporting Su Yu and his companions, accelerating the tide.

...

Su Yu paid little attention to these matters. Soon, they emerged from the acupoint passage. At this moment, Su Yu once again beheld the Heaven Gate.

The Martial Emperor's Heaven Gate!

This gate, standing in the Sea of Stars for countless ages, represented the Luminous Domain Mansion, the greatest treasure trove of the Myriad Realms. After today, this portal might vanish forever.

The Martial Emperor's voice, tinged with excitement, echoed faintly, "Disperse the power of laws!"

His consciousness had fully awakened, yet some great paths still suppressed him. Additionally, the power of laws in the Myriad Realms hindered his unsealing.

Su Yu looked up at the sky. The Heaven Gate was open, revealing the Allheaven Battlefield, densely woven with the power of laws, like a vast net ensnaring the entire battlefield.

"The Allheaven Battlefield..." Su Yu murmured. It was time. Time to fully unseal the Upper and Lower Realms, to usher in the tidal change.

A tidal change that occurred once every ten thousand years. This time, it was happening at six thousand years. Yes, the connection between the Upper and Lower Realms often marked the beginning of a tidal change. And its end was usually signified by the fall of the Human Lord and the closure of the Allheaven Battlefield.

"The fall of the Human Lord, the closure of the battlefield!" Su Yu murmured, gaining new insights. The death of the Human Lord led to the battlefield's closure. What did that mean?

This battlefield was artificially created, Su Yu knew. But the death of the Human Lord, the weakening of the human race's fortune, would automatically close the battlefield. Was this to protect the human race?

The Human Emperor and others had been meticulous in setting up the Allheaven Battlefield!

At this moment, Su Yu understood how the battlefield operated. He took a deep breath, and the tokens appeared before him. Each token bore a shadow—immortals, demons, gods, dragons...

The rulers of the myriad races had forged these tokens, representing their will!

The winds howled, and the sea surged. Su Yu sensed presences behind him but ignored them. They were likely from the Nine Realms, busy with their land creation. Let them be!

Soon, the Martial Emperor would break free, and no land, no matter how strong, would withstand it.

At that moment, a figure flew swiftly toward them. It was Marquis Lanshan!

...

Marquis Lanshan, too, looked skyward, his expression grave. Su Yu had instructed Tongtian to direct him to the Sea of Stars, to the Luminous Domain Mansion. Was Su Yu returning to the Human Realm?

With thoughts swirling, Marquis Lanshan flew swiftly, traversing the void. In an instant, he saw the Heaven Gate, Su Yu beneath it, and the tokens before him!

Council Tokens!

"Su Human Lord!" Marquis Lanshan's heart stirred. He bowed slightly. Su Yu turned, smiling. "Marquis Lanshan, your arrival is not a good omen!"

Marquis Lanshan's expression was serious. What did he mean?

"Marquis Lanshan, it's truly difficult!" Su Yu chuckled. "Speak, what brings you here?"

"Human Lord, I come on behalf of His Majesty, Hundred Battle King..."

"Hundred Battle King?" Su Yu laughed. "Is it about Moon Luo and the others?"

"It has nothing to do with them!" Marquis Lanshan quickly replied. "It's about..."

"Let's talk later. If you continue, the Martial Emperor will lose his temper!"

At this moment, a figure barely formed in the void—it was the Martial Emperor. He glanced at Marquis Lanshan, displeased.

Get lost!

You're delaying important matters!

Can't you see we're busy?

Marquis Lanshan's heart stirred. "Human Lord, are you..."

"Unsealing the Upper and Lower Realms."

Marquis Lanshan was shocked. "Human Lord, unsealing the realms... this..."

"Is there a problem?"

Marquis Lanshan's expression was grave. "If you do this, the Upper and Lower Realms will be freely accessible! For the human race, the Human Realm will have no suppressive power. This may not be a good thing. Human Lord, please reconsider!"

Su Yu smiled. "It's fine. It's all the same! Let Hundred Battle King show himself. There's no need to hide all the time, is there? Hiding won't save the human race!"

Su Yu shook his head. "Isn't hiding tiring? The myriad races are on guard, and I have to be on guard too! Isn't it annoying? Tell Hundred Battle King, I don't need him to do anything. Just keep an eye on the myriad races and the Chaos Dragon for me. He can do that! I don't even need him to fight. Just keep watch, and I'll handle the Sin Clan!"

This was Su Yu's plan. I don't need you to fight. If you're hiding, then hide. If the myriad races make a move, just block them for me. I'll lead the charge against the Sin Clan. There's a good chance we can take down two rulers of laws.

Hundred Battle King just doesn't want to cooperate. Otherwise, Su Yu could handle the Sin Clan while Hundred Battle King dealt with the myriad races. The Myriad Realms' troubles would be resolved quickly!

Su Yu could leave the Myriad Realms to Hundred Battle King. I could take my people and join the battle upstream! As for when to return, that's a matter for later.

Unfortunately, Hundred Battle King hides all day, and Su Yu is annoyed, so he doesn't bring up cooperation. Leaving it to Hundred Battle King has its advantages. At least Hundred Battle King won't harm the human race after Su Yu leaves.

This way, Su Yu can be at ease.

As Su Yu pondered, Marquis Lanshan suddenly said, "I heard the Human Lord achieved a great victory in the Upper Realm?"

"Did Moon Luo tell you that?"

The Martial Emperor was growing impatient. "Su Yu, why are you talking to this little bug? It's annoying!"

**Chapter 1: The Proposal**

In the midst of a tense atmosphere, the Marquis of South Suppression spoke urgently, "Human Lord, His Majesty Hundred Battle suggests that we temporarily set aside the matter of the Control King lineage. We should first join forces to eliminate the Myriad Races, and only then consider dealing with the Control King lineage."

Su Yu pondered for a moment before smiling, "That's not impossible. Is he willing to contribute? If so, we can proceed."

Hundred Battle willing to fight the Myriad Races? That would be a good thing!

Su Yu chuckled, "Here's the deal: he doesn't need to do much. If his people can hold back five of the Celestial Sovereigns, I'll take care of the Myriad Races myself. He doesn't even need to lift a finger. Am I not being generous?"

Focusing on the Myriad Races first was indeed a viable plan. Was the Marquis of South Suppression here to genuinely propose cooperation? Su Yu was surprised but also pleased. "Finally, Hundred Battle has come to his senses. The Myriad Races and the Sin Clan are mere nuisances. The real challenge lies ahead. Wasting too much time in the Myriad Realms isn't wise. Once we conquer the Myriad Realms, we can rescue the Human Emperor and the others!"

Su Yu laughed, "We shouldn't wait for the Human Emperor and the others to be defeated and return. If they do, it means they've lost. If we are to join the battle, we must help them turn the tide. Otherwise, the thrill of battle won't be enough!"

The Marquis of South Suppression chuckled, but beneath his laughter was a sense of loss. Su Yu was open to cooperation and willing to exert great effort. If Hundred Battle could hold back the Myriad Races or deploy five Celestial Sovereigns, Su Yu would contribute even more, first to annihilate the Myriad Races and then to eliminate the Control King lineage.

Su Yu was even prepared to leave the Myriad Realms to Hundred Battle, while he led his forces upstream to rescue the Human Emperor and the others. If Hundred Battle agreed, it would be an unparalleled offer in the eyes of the Marquis of South Suppression.

Su Yu didn't seem intent on a full-scale war with Hundred Battle.

"Then, Human Lord, are you not planning to reclaim the Human Realm?"

Su Yu laughed, "Fool! If I'm going on a long journey, having someone to watch over my home isn't bad, right? Besides, when I return, the Human Emperor will be back too. Who will be the leader of the Human Realm then? It's not worth the hassle! Right now, I'm more interested in the powerful beings behind the gates..."

With a radiant smile, Su Yu continued, "Isn't it a waste to come to this world without meeting those legendary figures?"

Turning to the Marquis of South Suppression, he said, "Alright, let's settle it this way. Go tell Hundred Battle that I'm not interested in competing for the position of the Human Lord. Of course, he won't be able to hold it for long. I'll soon bring back the Human Emperor and the others... and they can take over!"

This was also a good choice!

Su Yu added, "If the Human Emperor and the others don't do well, we can overthrow them again!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "In this era, might makes right. Once we're stronger than the Human Emperor, he'll just be another worker, won't he?"

The Marquis of South Suppression laughed but then fell silent. "Human Lord, His Majesty Hundred Battle's intention is to eliminate the Myriad Races, but the Control King lineage cannot be destroyed at this moment. His Majesty intends to open the Gate of Hell to bring back the Human Ancestor."

"Hmm?"

Su Yu was taken aback, "The Human Ancestor... is in the Gate of Hell?"

"Yes."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "That works too. In that case, we'll first bring back the Human Emperor and the others, and then immediately attack the Gate of Hell! Of course, it's best to first eliminate the rulers of the Myriad Races, or else things could go wrong! The Chaos Race is not on our side, as evidenced by the actions of the Dragon Beast! We should unite with the Human Emperor and the others, suppress the Myriad Races, then bring back the Human Ancestor, eliminate the Chaos Race... we can take it step by step, and finally rescue the Culture King and the others, and attack the Heaven Gate... I think the Heaven Gate is the most dangerous!"

This was Su Yu's feeling. The Heaven Gate might be even more dangerous than the Gate of Hell! Because within the Heaven Gate, figures like the Culture King seemed to be constantly pursued and on the run, while within the Gate of Hell, the Control King, though weaker than the Culture King, seemed to be doing quite well, even able to cultivate their own followers.

Therefore, the first target should be the Gate of Hell, to eliminate the Chaos Race, then the Control King. If the Human Ancestor is there, bring him back, unite all forces, and attack the Heaven Gate together.

This was Su Yu's ideal scenario, though it might not go as planned.

The Marquis of South Suppression, seeing Su Yu's clear plan, remained silent for a moment before saying, "His Majesty Hundred Battle's intention is to first bring back the Human Ancestor, then go upstream to rescue the Human Emperor."

Su Yu was stunned, "Is he an idiot? Bringing back the Human Ancestor first... First, it's uncertain if the Human Ancestor is even there. Second, if the Human Ancestor comes out, won't the beings in the Chaos also come out? Third, is the Human Ancestor powerful? Fourth, if we fail to bring him back and accidentally bring out the Control King, will Hundred Battle handle it? Fifth, the Human Ancestor belongs to the ancient era, while we are inheritors of the ancient past. Will the Human Ancestor even care about the Human Emperor and the others? After all, whether the Culture King lives or dies has nothing to do with him! Sixth, the Human Ancestor seems to have established his own branch, the Giant Race. Will he prioritize the Giant Race over the Human Race? Are we to become subordinates to the Giant Race?"

Su Yu fired off a series of questions, then laughed, "What is Hundred Battle thinking? Of course, we should rescue the Human Emperor first! The Gate of Hell should be sealed after eliminating the Sin Clan! At least delay until the Human Emperor returns... My plan is to first eliminate the Sin Clan, then have Hundred Battle guard the Gate of Hell. If anyone comes out, kill them... just don't let them out... Do you think Hundred Battle will agree?"

The Marquis of South Suppression remained silent.

Su Yu's smile gradually faded, "What do you mean? Did Hundred Battle... send you to suggest that I open the Gate of Hell first?"

The Marquis of South Suppression's eyes were complex, "Yes! His Majesty Hundred Battle's intention is exactly that!"

He paused, then added, "Not only that, His Majesty also said not to attack the Control King lineage. The Control King carries a locator, which is the will of chaos. Killing the Control King might render the locator ineffective, making it impossible to open the Gate of Hell!"

He quickly continued, "Therefore, the Control King must not only be kept alive but also constantly pressured to keep bringing people in, expanding the rift of the Gate of Hell!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "Nonsense! If it really expands, and dozens of rulers come out, will Hundred Battle fight them?"

"His Majesty said... the Human Ancestor will fight them!"

Su Yu couldn't help but curse, "Damn it! The Human Ancestor? Even if the Human Ancestor is in there, he hasn't fought the Chaos all these years! If he had, would the Control King still be at ease inside? Would the ancient Chaos Race still be able to come out? Isn't this nonsense?"

The Marquis of South Suppression remained silent, then added, "His Majesty said the Human Ancestor is the only hope."

"Damn it!"

Su Yu cursed again!

"Did Hundred Battle really say that?"

"Yes."

"So, all his hopes are pinned on the Human Ancestor?"

"Yes!"

"He... impossible!"

Su Yu raged, "How is that possible! Relying on someone we've never met to save all beings? Is he out of his mind? Even if it's his ancestor, who knows how many generations have passed? Does he know how strong the Human Ancestor is? Does he know the current state of the Human Ancestor? Does he know if the Human Ancestor still considers the current Human Race as his people? We know nothing about the Human Ancestor! At least we know a bit about the Human Emperor. The Human Emperor and the others are blocking the upstream, fighting the Myriad Races, which at least proves that they are protecting the Human Race!"

This was obvious!

The Human Emperor and his group were willing to fight for the Human Race and protect all beings. They had fought for countless years, which was worthy of trust.

The Human Ancestor... who knows anything about him?

Su Yu laughed in exasperation, "Marquis of South Suppression, are you joking with me?"

The Marquis of South Suppression lowered his head, "No, this is indeed His Majesty's intention, and he requests that the Human Lord not attack the Control King lineage. He will exert enough pressure on the Control King lineage... The Human Lord only needs to focus on dealing with the Myriad Races!"

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure!"

The Marquis of South Suppression lowered his head, avoiding Su Yu's gaze, "Moreover, if the Human Lord insists on attacking the Control King lineage, His Majesty might intervene!"

Su Yu looked at him deeply, "Something's not right. Have you betrayed us? Are you deliberately provoking a fight between me and Hundred Battle?"

Why did he feel that the Marquis of South Suppression's words seemed to be deliberately inciting conflict?

Was this really Hundred Battle's intention?

The Marquis of South Suppression kept his head down, "I have never betrayed the Human Race, never! Under His Majesty's command, there are currently eight Celestial Sovereigns, including Thunderstorm! However, among them, Blood Shadow and Red Moon are both inclined towards the Human Race! Evergreen and Wuji strictly follow His Majesty's orders! As for Longbrow... he is solely focused on targeting the Human Lord, and Jiang Hai and Mist Mountain harbor no small hostility towards the Human Lord!"

Su Yu looked at him in surprise.

The Marquis of South Suppression kept his head lowered, not meeting Su Yu's eyes, and continued, "I don't know... which choice is better! But the Human Lord and the Human Emperor are on one side, while His Majesty and the Human Ancestor are on another... In terms of the desire to protect the Human Race... perhaps... I should be somewhat biased..."

"Under His Majesty's command, there are also those who are devoted to the Human Race. The Human Race is their faith... but back then, they had no choice but to avoid battle. If they hadn't... His Majesty and the others had to avoid battle, or everyone else would have died!"

"Marquis of South Creek and several other ancient marquises are actually still inclined towards the Human Race, but... they previously believed that His Majesty could bring greater hope to the Human Race!"

The Marquis of South Suppression kept his head down, "I have not betrayed, but I chose to follow His Majesty back then... Therefore, I will fight for His Majesty. If one day... I become an enemy of the Human Lord, the Human Lord need not show mercy! His Majesty's mind is made up, and he will not change his plans due to some changes!"

"The words of Longbrow may just be His Majesty's mouthpiece!"

With that, the Marquis of South Suppression handed over a large sphere, leaving it in place, and slowly retreated, bowing deeply, his tone complex, "I don't know which outcome is better! But what the Human Lord said aligns with my thoughts! I don't know who the Human Ancestor is, I don't know how strong the Human Ancestor is, but I do know that the Human Emperor and Emperor Yu are still fighting for the Human Race... never stopping!"

"I only hope... that the Human Race can be better!"

With those words, the Marquis of South Suppression quickly vanished into the air, his silhouette desolate.

He didn't know if he was right or wrong, or if he had betrayed the Hundred Battle King. But he knew he was following his heart, hoping for the prosperity of the Human Race. He had never betrayed them! From the very beginning, it had always been this way. The Human Race was his true faith!

Everything he said was also what the Hundred Battle King had instructed him to convey. However, he had been more blunt, expressing the idea that the Hundred Battle King would never change his mind, urging Su Yu to prepare early. If you insist... a battle between the two sides is inevitable!

At this moment, Su Yu's face turned completely grim. There was no room for negotiation! Otherwise, the South Suppressing Marquis wouldn't have such an attitude, wouldn't be so resolute. What he left behind was death aura. Clearly, the South Suppressing Marquis was already worried, worried that the Hundred Battle King and his people would use the death aura to directly attack Su Yu's stronghold!

At this moment, Su Yu's expression was extremely dark. After a while, he spoke in a low voice, "Lantian, investigate the attitude of the Hundred Battle King's faction. Is it really as the South Suppressing Marquis said?"

The words of the South Suppressing Marquis alone couldn't be entirely trusted, but they couldn't be completely dismissed either. Su Yu wasn't a reckless person. If there was a problem with the South Suppressing Marquis and he ended up fighting the Hundred Battle King, it would only benefit their opponents and enemies. But... if it was true...

Su Yu's eyes instantly filled with murderous intent. "If he really chooses this path and ruins my plans, then I... will not be polite!"

A murderous aura surged! What nonsense! First break the Gate of Hell? What exactly was the Hundred Battle King thinking? Su Yu's face was livid. He didn't expect help, but he couldn't afford to be dragged down. Otherwise, no matter how powerful the Hundred Battle King was, he would still kill him!

At this moment, even the Martial Emperor beside him, despite his urgency, didn't dare to speak. When Su Yu got angry, to be honest, even he felt a bit apprehensive. Earlier, Su Yu had been in a good mood, but now his mood had turned from sunny to cloudy. At this moment, the Martial Emperor was extremely anxious but didn't dare to urge him, fearing that Su Yu might vent his anger on him.
