Chapter 717: Six Daofuse Experts Enter the Trap (Subscription Requested)

"Human Lord, should we head to Marquis Huoyun or Marquis Zhennan first?"

A group of two had turned into a group of four. Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu hadn't brought their subordinates along, opting instead to keep them hidden. After all, it was uncertain how long they would remain with Su Yu; they might need to flee at any moment.

Just as General Yingwu asked the question, Marquis Yunshui interrupted softly, "Yunshui is more curious about which Upper Realm the Human Lord comes from."

Su Yu smiled, "The Torchbearer's passage."

Seeing that he didn't specify the exact location, Marquis Yunshui smiled gently and didn't press further, maintaining her soft demeanor.

Su Yu transmitted a message to the Great Zhou King, "Keep an eye on Marquis Yunshui. Women who appear gentle can be fiercer than anyone when provoked!"

"How does Emperor Yu know?"

"It's explained in books!"

Su Yu scoffed. Did they think he hadn't read enough books? Su Yu had truly read countless volumes. General Yingwu was easier to deal with, but Marquis Yunshui, in Su Yu's opinion, was more troublesome.

Just listen to her question: Which Upper Realm did you come from? Could he say he came from the Soul Burying Mountain? That was clearly probing for specific locations, something he couldn't disclose.

"She doesn't get along well with the Hundred Battle King, does she?" Su Yu asked again.

The Great Zhou King replied, "Not particularly, but they aren't on bad terms either."

Su Yu nodded and then spoke up, "General Yingwu, I heard you mention before that the Hundred Battle King was entangled with some woman, and you even advised him?"

At this, General Yingwu snorted, "Who else could it be but that seductive Moon Luo!"

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly and said, "You mean Moon Luo? There wasn't much entanglement between her and the Hundred Battle King, was there?"

"What do you know!" General Yingwu sneered, "You men know nothing! The Hundred Battle King and Moon Luo were already involved. I even caught them once. I advised him back then that Moon Luo was too seductive and best avoided. She was nothing like Marquis Yunshui..."

Marquis Yunshui smiled softly and glanced at her.

General Yingwu coughed lightly and quickly added, "But that idiot Hundred Battle King treated my words like air and ignored me! Who is Moon Luo? She had ambiguous relationships with several genius warriors before, playing hard to get. Did she think we were fools who couldn't see through her? In the end, she hooked the Hundred Battle King, who was the most talented at the time. I knew then that the Hundred Battle King was bound to suffer!"

The Great Zhou King silently criticized but soon chuckled, "Moon Luo... I remember she didn't participate in the final battle, right? Her strength wasn't that great..."

"Hmph!" General Yingwu sneered, "Didn't participate? Of course not. In the final battle, the Hundred Battle King probably hid her within his weapon to protect her, fearing the chaos of the myriad races would affect Moon Luo. That wretched woman either died or was sealed with the Hundred Battle King, or... she betrayed him!"

"Though I'm dissatisfied with the Hundred Battle King's stubbornness, to say he was utterly useless isn't fair!"

General Yingwu added truthfully, "He was genuinely strong. If he encountered three to five quasi-kings, he would likely kill them! In the final battle, the Hundred Battle King lured away six or seven quasi-kings and over ten top-tier Daofuse experts... Even if he couldn't win, it's impossible he didn't kill a single one before being sealed!"

General Yingwu continued, "But as you saw, in the final battle, the Hundred Battle King vanished without a trace! Not a sound! If you say he betrayed us, then if he had, and came out to ambush us, none of us would have survived! But he was sealed, so betrayal seems unlikely. However, he must have been caught off guard and schemed against!"

"Besides Moon Luo, I can't think of anyone else!"

General Yingwu shook her head, "It must be Moon Luo. The Hundred Battle King had no defenses against her, even hiding her within his weapon, or perhaps in a separate weapon space... If Moon Luo had any issues, the Hundred Battle King would surely be doomed!"

The Great Zhou King's expression shifted, and after a long pause, he sighed, "If that's the case... then it's understandable why he was easily sealed!"

To hide a powerful figure close by, a hidden expert from the Control King's lineage. No defenses whatsoever! If the other side betrayed, it would be a disaster. Otherwise, no matter how strong the myriad races were, sealing the Hundred Battle King would be difficult without losing two or three quasi-kings.

Su Yu merely listened silently, not interrupting.

Interesting!

Moon Luo!

A strong figure from the Control King's lineage?

If so, then sealing the Hundred Battle King wasn't done by an ordinary person. The strength required to hide one's power in front of the Hundred Battle King wasn't simple.

Moon Luo, Ziyan...

Su Yu thought of himself and suddenly wanted to laugh. He, too, was carrying a woman from the Control King's lineage, and she was strong, with the power of a Heavenly King.

In this light, he was quite similar to the Hundred Battle King.

Of course, the Hundred Battle King carried her for protection, while Su Yu carried her as a potential bomb.

If the West King's Consort wasn't sealed and was hiding in the Mark of Civilization, even if Su Yu had the power of a Heavenly King, facing a strong enemy, it would be easy for a Heavenly King to kill him.

"Not an undeserved loss!"

Su Yu mused, the Hundred Battle King didn't lose undeservedly. In the midst of a great battle, carrying a woman for protection—who else would be the one to betray you?

Moon Luo!

Su Yu noted the name, perhaps he could ask the West King's Consort about it later.

Maybe she was even a relative of the West King's Consort!

On the road, Marquis Yunshui remained silent.

Su Yu didn't speak much either, but the usually reticent Great Zhou King was more talkative, chatting with General Yingwu, mainly to gather information. It wasn't appropriate for Su Yu to ask, but the Great Zhou King didn't mind.

After six thousand years in the Upper Realm, much intelligence was outdated.

...

As they flew closer to Divine Fire Mountain, General Yingwu finally realized they were heading there first. He thought for a moment and reminded, "Marquis Huoyun has a fiery temper and is very powerful, stronger than any of us."

General Yingwu had the combat strength of a third-tier Daofuse expert. Marquis Yunshui was at the peak of the third tier, possibly nearing the second tier. These surviving marquises were no simpletons. Even Marquis Dingjun had the combat strength of a third-tier Daofuse expert. Marquis Huoyun might be nearing the peak of the second tier, a formidable figure on the verge of entering the Heavenly King realm.

"Marquis Zhennan and Marquis Huoyun are both very strong. The late Marquis Minshan was a true quasi-king, but unfortunately, he fell. Between Marquis Zhennan and Marquis Huoyun, it's hard to say who's stronger."

"Marquis Shadow is the most mysterious, also nearing the peak of Daofuse strength..."

In any case, among the six Daofuse experts, Marquis Dingjun and General Yingwu were comparable in strength, while Marquis Shadow and Marquis Yunshui were similar, with the remaining two being a notch stronger.

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Few survived, but those who did were elite.

In Divine Fire Mountain, Marquis Huoyun should be able to battle a Heavenly King.

Approaching Divine Fire Mountain, Su Yu's eyes revealed the Heaven Gate, scanning the mountain. There were many volcanoes, and the power of fire was strong. Su Yu scanned each one before continuing forward.

Marquis Yunshui seemed a bit uncomfortable. Just as Su Yu was about to speak, she softly said, "I'm fine following along."

Considerate!

Yet Su Yu didn't like it!

He truly didn't like this type. He preferred those whose intentions were hard to guess. General Yingwu was straightforward, while the silent types were harder to deal with.

Marquis Yunshui, of course, didn't know what Su Yu was thinking.

She was also observing Su Yu. This Human Lord from the Lower Realm gave her a vague sense of familiarity, as if she was seeing the Culture King of old. But she was meticulous; upon closer inspection, he wasn't quite the same. It was just a feeling.

At this moment, Su Yu transmitted, "Great Zhou King, if you and I join forces, can we take down Marquis Huoyun?"

"Difficult!" The Great Zhou King replied, "In Divine Fire Mountain, it's very challenging! He's close to Heavenly King strength. For us to take him down... we can hold our ground, but..."

"Lantian can come at any time," Su Yu transmitted. "His avatar is here; his main body can arrive at any moment."

The Great Zhou King inhaled sharply. Wow, it could work like that?

No wonder Su Yu insisted on carrying a Lantian avatar.

"With him, if Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu don't interfere, we should be able to take him down."

Just as Su Yu finished speaking, he suddenly looked in a certain direction.

At this moment, atop a volcano, Marquis Shadow also sensed some movement, realizing someone was observing him.

At this time, Su Yu didn't hide anything.

Besides Marquis Shadow, there was no one else here.

On the volcano, Marquis Shadow was slightly surprised. Why was he here?

Previously, Su Yu had asked him to contact the other marquises. He naturally thought of Marquis Huoyun first and arranged to meet him here, but the other party hadn't shown up yet.

Sensing Su Yu's presence, Marquis Shadow hesitated for a moment but quickly flew out of the volcano, his body turning into a shadow.

Moments later, Marquis Shadow appeared, somewhat surprised.

Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu were also present!

He kept a distance and said in a deep voice, "Nameless Daoist!"

Su Yu looked at Marquis Shadow and smiled, "Are you waiting for Marquis Huoyun here?"

"Yes."

"Your efficiency is slow."

"......"

No words to counter.

Su Yu had asked him to contact others, and he was still at Divine Fire Mountain, while Su Yu already had two Daofuse experts with him.

That's efficiency!

But he wasn't as bold as Su Yu, daring to run around. He was always cautious, which was why he could remain active and survive to this day.

Su Yu hadn't taken long, not even two days.

He already had two Daofuse experts with him.

Marquis Shadow was helpless and said, "I was worried about attracting attention, so I was cautious."

Moreover, he didn't know the exact hiding places of the other marquises.

He only knew the general area, so contacting them was more challenging.

After speaking, he asked, "Did you come here to see Marquis Huoyun?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Go see Marquis Huoyun and tell him he owes me a life. He might not know, but you do! I don't want to say more; he must serve me for three years. Go!"

Marquis Shadow pondered for a moment and said, "Nameless Daoist, if you wish to subdue Marquis Huoyun, perhaps a more conciliatory approach would be better... demanding repayment for a favor..."

Su Yu spoke calmly, "It's about repaying a debt of gratitude. I don't need him to submit to me. It's said that Marquis Huoyun has a fiery temper, but that's fine. People with fiery tempers are usually straightforward. But if someone is hot-tempered and not straightforward... what use do I have for such a person?"

There was nothing wrong with his words.

Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu were somewhat surprised. This person seemed different from before.

General Yingwu looked at Shadow Marquis and asked, "Have you met him before?"

She was cautious, "Shadow Marquis, whose side are you on?"

Whose side?

Shadow Marquis was puzzled, but General Yingwu continued, "The Human Lord wants to take the position of the Hundred Battle King of the Human Race. Who do you support?"

"The Human Lord?"

Shadow Marquis was slightly taken aback and looked at Su Yu. Su Yu had never revealed his identity to him before, but now he had changed his mind. Shadow Marquis... wouldn't be leaving!

So, he didn't mind if General Yingwu exposed his identity.

At this moment, seeing Shadow Marquis looking over, Su Yu smiled faintly, "I am the Human Lord of the Lower Realm. Are you surprised, Shadow Marquis?"

Shadow Marquis was shocked.

The Human Lord!

Of course, he was surprised.

However, he knew more than General Yingwu and the others. This person... was not to be trifled with. He could turn hostile at any moment!

Moreover, he was cunning and had many powerful subordinates.

He had even opened the Heaven Gate!

Heaven Gate... Human Lord... At this moment, Shadow Marquis was relieved. It made sense that the Human Lord had opened the Heaven Gate.

Shadow Marquis cautiously said, "I am indeed surprised. Shadow greets the Human Lord! I was unaware of your identity before and was disrespectful."

Su Yu chuckled, "No need for formalities! Go ahead, Marquis Huoyun is beneath the seventh volcano. Go see him and tell him he owes me his life and should repay it by serving me for three years. That's all."

"What if he refuses?"

Shadow Marquis hesitated for a moment. Su Yu replied calmly, "If he is ungrateful and doesn't repay his debt, what do you think should be done?"

Shadow Marquis was shaken. He subtly extended his willpower to probe the surroundings.

He wanted to know if that person with countless avatars had arrived.

If he had... this person had opened the Heaven Gate. Marquis Huoyun might evade the myriad races, but he couldn't escape him. If that person arrived, along with the others here, if Marquis Huoyun disobeyed, he might die!

Moreover, he knew that Marquis Dingjun had been captured back then!

Afterward, he obediently worked for this person.

This person was no saint!

Shadow Marquis thought heavily, "Alright, I'll go see Marquis Huoyun!"

"Thank you!"

"Not at all, it's my duty!"

Shadow Marquis quickly disappeared.

General Yingwu was a bit surprised and looked at Su Yu, "Do you know him? This guy is usually very gloomy, but today he's quite agreeable."

Su Yu smiled, "He doesn't know I'm opposing the Hundred Battle King, so he's giving me face. If he knew, he might not be so polite."

"True!"

General Yingwu nodded, "These guys are all stubborn. If they knew, they might oppose you. By the way, you said you saved Huoyun because of the previous incident with the Dragon Race?"

Su Yu nodded with a smile, "That's right. I led people to kill the Dragon Race experts, which resolved the crisis here. Marquis Huoyun owes me his life, doesn't he?"

"Of course!"

General Yingwu nodded, there was nothing wrong with that.

...

At the same time.

At the base of a volcano.

Marquis Huoyun was startled. Shadow Marquis was heading straight for him!

How could this be?

I'm hiding here, how does Shadow know?

Just passing by?

He had been observing Shadow, worried that there might be an issue with him. Moreover, Shadow seemed to have gone to the outskirts to talk to someone, which made him even more uneasy. But now, Shadow was coming directly here, making Marquis Huoyun extremely vigilant, not daring to be careless.

Shadow Marquis also knew that Marquis Huoyun would be cautious and suspicious. At this moment, he floated outside the volcano and looked at it.

A strong person who had opened the Heaven Gate said Marquis Huoyun was here, so he must be.

He didn't question or doubt anything, and said in a deep voice, "Huoyun, don't be nervous, listen to me! You were previously besieged here because someone attacked the Dragon Race, killing six Daofuse Realm experts, including Blood Dragon Marquis. The myriad races were in turmoil, and you were able to break free!"

"Now, that person has asked me to tell you that you owe him a life. Whether you acknowledge it or not is up to you!"

...

At the base of the volcano.

Marquis Huoyun frowned.

Owing someone a life, the other party killed six Daofuse Realm experts of the Dragon Race, including a quasi-king?

Is it true?

However, this could explain why Marquis Blood Severance and the others withdrew so quickly. If so, then there's no problem.

"Huoyun, I know you're here. Don't overthink it. If someone really wanted to deal with you, if it was really related to the myriad races, knowing your exact location, three quasi-kings would be enough to easily kill you without any damage! No matter how strong you are here, you're only comparable to a quasi-king. Your greatest trump card is that no one knows your exact location!"

"Now, Marquis Dingjun, Marquis Yunshui, and General Yingwu have all pledged allegiance to this person. This person has asked me to ask you, you owe him a life, and he wants you to serve him for three years. Are you willing?"

In the volcano.

Marquis Huoyun confirmed that his location had been exposed. Hearing the names of the others, he frowned slightly and suddenly appeared outside the volcano, looking at Shadow Marquis not far away, and said in a deep voice, "Serve him? Who is he? Is everything you said true?"

Shadow Marquis looked at Marquis Huoyun and nodded, "Everything is true! Moreover, I was the one who went to see Marquis Dingjun that day, hoping they could come to save you. Afterward, that person led people to attack the Dragon Race, and Marquis Blood Severance and the others had to withdraw to deal with the crisis!"

"Who is he?"

"The current Human Lord!"

"The Human Lord?"

Marquis Huoyun laughed, "Are you kidding me? There's no Human Lord anymore..."

"From the Lower Realm!"

Marquis Huoyun's laughter halted, and Shadow Marquis hadn't heard Su Yu say he was from the Lower Realm, but he had guessed it.

That group of people all came from the Lower Realm!

The Human Lord, quasi-kings, Marquis Dingjun's allegiance...

Those people must be from the Lower Realm.

He quickly said, "That person came from the Lower Realm. Now, the other three have already followed him! At this moment, the person is outside the Divine Fire Mountain. He wants you to serve him for three years to repay the life-saving grace. Are you willing or not?"

Marquis Huoyun was a bit agitated, "Three years? What use is three years! He came from the Lower Realm, are there still strong human experts in the Lower Realm?"

"There are!"

Marquis Huoyun asked anxiously, "How strong?"

"Perhaps slightly stronger than me, but not a quasi-king."

Marquis Huoyun was instantly disappointed, not a quasi-king!

"Then how did he kill Blood Dragon Marquis?"

"He has quasi-king experts under his command."

"There are quasi-kings in the Lower Realm?"

"This tide gave birth to them."

Marquis Huoyun was shocked, "This tide gave birth to a quasi-king, but the person you call the Human Lord isn't a quasi-king. Are you joking? Even if there is a Human Lord, it should be that quasi-king expert, right?"

"I don't know about that. Maybe Marquis Dingjun knows more."

"Where is Marquis Dingjun?"

Shadow Marquis shook his head, "I don't know, he didn't come. I only saw Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu, and Zhou Tiansheng from back then, that Eternal, but now he should be at the peak of Daofuse. I don't know if he's hiding his strength."

Shadow Marquis instantly recognized the Great Zhou King. No one knew his ancient identity, but his identity from the last tide wasn't much different from now.

Marquis Huoyun frowned, "He said he wants me to serve him for three years? Did he say anything else?"

"No!"

Shadow Marquis shook his head, "This person... is mysterious in his actions. I don't know exactly what he wants. I've only met him once! After meeting for an hour, the Dragon Race was gone. His actions were decisive, and I was shocked that day."

Marquis Huoyun frowned, "It sounds like there's more to your words."

Shadow Marquis was silent for a while before speaking, "Sort of. When we met that day, although we didn't talk much, this person gave me the feeling... of being supremely arrogant and domineering, reminding me of some people and some things. What I have to do, I must do. If I can't do it... then you have no value in existing!"

Marquis Huoyun was shaken, his expression changing, "What do you mean? If I don't serve him, can he kill me?"

"Probably!"

Shadow Marquis looked at him, "Very likely. You know Marquis Dingjun, he's not a good-tempered person, but the last time I saw him, he was extremely respectful to him. Moreover, I just saw his people the other day. That quasi-king expert just asked me to notify you to meet... In the blink of an eye, Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu appeared by his side. Obviously, something changed. This person needs us to follow and serve, or... not block his path!"

Shadow Marquis took a deep breath, "In two days, Marquis Yunshui and General Yingwu have come out of seclusion and submitted. In two days, I couldn't even find them... Huoyun, do you understand what I mean?"

"I understand."

Marquis Huoyun's eyes flickered, "You're saying he can find me at any time and kill me at any time, right?"

"Yes."

Marquis Huoyun frowned, "He's also human, and I'm human too. Even if he's the current Human Lord, I'm still an ancient marquis!"

"You owe him a life!"

Shadow Marquis looked at him, "Not just you, but those under your command are alive because of him. Now he wants you to repay your debt. Will you?"

Marquis Huoyun was irritated, "I'm not even familiar with him! Doesn't this guy know how to say polite words? I'm an elder, after all. Just saying serve him or die, what does that mean?"

He just felt that this new Human Lord seemed a bit disrespectful to him!

Not a single polite word!

He just sent Shadow Marquis to threaten him, which made him uncomfortable.

Shadow Marquis said softly, "You know the situation in the Lower Realm. He can kill his way up from the Lower Realm... I don't need to say more. You should be able to understand some things."

Marquis Huoyun frowned and after a long pause, said, "So you think I should serve him for three years?"

"Decide for yourself."

Marquis Huoyun cursed, "Decide my ass!"

After a while, feeling a headache, he said, "I always feel like this isn't a good thing... If I had known, I might as well have let Marquis Blood Severance besiege me! Fine, three years, right? Three years... doesn't seem too long! Alright, I'll make arrangements and go myself. Damn it, this guy doesn't seem easy to get along with."

Shadow Marquis said nothing.

And soon, Marquis Huoyun disappeared.

He had no intention of bringing anyone along. Although Divine Fire Mountain had been exposed, his subordinates were still there, making it easier to hide. Following that newcomer, the Human Lord, who knew what might happen?

...

Su Yu waited at the outskirts of Divine Fire Mountain for nearly two hours. Finally, he saw Shadow Marquis and a burly man with fiery red hair flying towards him. The red-haired man, exuding a rebellious aura even from afar, cupped his hands and said, "Huoyun greets the Human Lord!"

He was addressing the Great Zhou King!

Whether it was intentional or he truly believed the Great Zhou King was the Human Lord, the likelihood of it being intentional was higher, especially since Shadow Marquis had already mentioned the Great Zhou King.

However, the Great Zhou King instantly vanished from his spot, his expression subtly changing as he chuckled, "Marquis Huoyun, you’ve mistaken me. I dare not accept such a title. I am Zhou Tianqi, a humble servant under the Human Emperor's command, responsible for the duties of the Imperial Palace's secret guards. My status is lowly, so please, Marquis, do not bow to the wrong person!"

Upon hearing this, the expressions of several powerful figures changed. They all turned to look at the Great Zhou King, including General Yingwu. At this moment, even Marquis Yunshui was slightly shaken, "It's you! No wonder... you seemed familiar. Are you under the Human Emperor's command?"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Just a nobody, not daring to compare with the esteemed marquises."

Yet, their expressions remained grave.

A nobody?

Even a seventh-rank official in front of a prime minister's gate holds some power. How much more so for someone under the Human Emperor!

Even the Culture King's dogs were stronger than the ancient marquises, let alone someone under the Human Emperor's command. These were trusted individuals! Without the Human Emperor's trust, how could one become a close aide?

The group looked at the Great Zhou King, who smiled and said, "I must have amused you all. I have met several of you marquises before, but I was on a different mission and couldn't be forthright. The Torchbearer lineage is now a thing of the past..."

With a sigh, the Great Zhou King shook his head, "Back then, I advised Danyu and Bingku not to expose the Torchbearers all at once, but they insisted on not listening. Alas, I was powerless to stop them and could only let it be!"

He smiled bitterly, "Now, perhaps I am the only one left of the Torchbearer lineage!"

At this moment, Marquis Huoyun was shocked, "It's rumored that the Torchbearers had three leaders. Danyu and Bingku were two of them. You knew them and could advise them... are you the third?"

He was somewhat surprised, "Back then, the Hundred Battle King asked who the third person was, but neither of them would say. They only mentioned that the third was their core, the last ember of the Torchbearers... were they referring to you?"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "You flatter me! The three of us were merely following the Human Emperor's orders to jointly oversee the inheritance of the flame. How could I be the core?"

As he spoke, he sighed again, "It's a pity that the Torchbearers' years of foundation vanished overnight!"

Despite his words, the marquises present were all extremely solemn.

The true core of the Torchbearers!

Not a quasi-king realm, as they had once thought. It turned out not to be a quasi-king, yet he was the core figure... this was even more extraordinary.

It represented the Human Emperor's great trust in him back then!

"Danyu and Bingku were both quasi-kings..."

Shadow Marquis softly remarked, and the Great Zhou King smiled, "Their talents surpassed mine. I lacked talent and, after years of stagnation, have only barely reached the peak of the Daofuse Realm."

His words left the marquises somewhat embarrassed.

Aren't we the same?

Moreover, we may not even be stronger than you. At least here, perhaps only Marquis Huoyun is on par with him, while the others are slightly weaker.

Having revealed his identity, the Great Zhou King quickly smiled and said, "So, Marquis Huoyun, you have mistaken me. I am not the Human Lord. His Majesty Emperor Yu is the Human Lord, so please do not mistake me again."

These words made everyone ponder deeply.

Su Yu also glanced at the Great Zhou King.

I knew he wasn't simple, but today I learned that this guy is actually the core figure of the Torchbearers.

He can endure!

Perhaps this is why the Human Emperor chose him as the core. Without the Great Zhou King, perhaps this tide would have already seen the extinction of the human race.

Strength isn't necessarily the most important.

In this tide, even if the Great Zhou King had the power of a Heavenly King, it would have been useless. If he had been exposed earlier, the myriad races might have attacked long ago.

The key is endurance.

Ordinary people truly cannot endure.

Marquis Huoyun, who had been somewhat arrogant moments ago, now showed a more respectful attitude after his expression changed slightly. He said in a deep voice, "Huoyun greets the Human Lord. Thank you for saving my life. For the next three years, should the Human Lord have any orders, feel free to command. I, Huoyun, am not one to forget kindness!"

It was merely gratitude, not submission.

Very normal!

Su Yu didn't mind. As long as you listen, everything else can be set aside. Three years later, a peak Daofuse Realm? I won't even care!

Su Yu smiled without saying much, nodding slightly.

Soon, he looked at Shadow Marquis. Seeing Su Yu's gaze, Shadow Marquis roughly guessed that Su Yu intended to subdue all the ancient powerful figures. At this moment, he exhaled and said, "Shadow is willing to serve the Human Lord!"

"No need to be so formal!"

Su Yu smiled, "We are all working for the human race. The title of Human Lord is just a name."

Responding with a smile, Su Yu said, "In that case, only Marquis Zhennan remains unaware."

Six Daofuse Realm experts, five have been brought under his command.

Whether it's submission, calculation, or waiting... it doesn't matter.

Keeping them close is better than letting them act on their own.

Su Yu smiled, "What do you all think? Will Marquis Zhennan listen to orders?"

The group exchanged glances. Shadow Marquis softly said, "Marquis Zhennan is also an old general with a broad perspective, but..."

He laid some groundwork in advance, "But Marquis Zhennan is somewhat rebellious..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Rebellious? How so?"

Shadow Marquis hesitated to elaborate, but Marquis Huoyun dismissively said, "That guy has a worse temper than mine, and... he doesn't easily submit to others! To put it bluntly, the Human Lord saved my life, so I can serve him. But for Marquis Zhennan, there's no such life-saving grace. He may not care. In his eyes, the only Human Lord these years has been the Hundred Battle King!"

Su Yu nodded with a smile, "I understand!"

With that, he smiled and asked, "If I were to subdue him, would you all be willing to lend a hand?"

"Subdue him?"

Marquis Huoyun was taken aback, and both General Yingwu and Marquis Yunshui were slightly startled.

Shadow Marquis, however, spoke heavily, "Just subdue... or... kill?"

Su Yu calmly said, "We'll see. If he refuses to listen even at the cost of his life, we may not be able to control him, and then we'll have no choice but to kill him!"

These words caused the group to change their expressions.

Marquis Huoyun, somewhat agitated, said, "You want to kill him? We have struggled for years in the Upper Realm for the continuation of the human race..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Was it me who made you struggle? Was it me who put you in such a predicament? Why boast about this as if it's an achievement? Moreover, this isn't an achievement; it's a disgrace, and this disgrace wasn't brought by me!"

"You squandered a great situation, leaving the Lower Realm in peril. Shouldn't you feel ashamed and apologize to the Lower Realm?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Why does such a shameful thing sound like glory when you speak of it? Am I the real sinner? Shouldn't the Hundred Battle King be blamed? I'm curious why you think your struggle in the Upper Realm is for us?"

Su Yu looked at them, smiling softly, "No more words. I'll ask again, if I want to subdue Marquis Zhennan, will you help?"

After about five or six seconds of silence, Su Yu smiled, "It's okay, after all, we are comrades. You and I aren't too familiar yet."

"To betray your comrades so quickly, I wouldn't be too confident either."

"Just... hope this is your only time disobeying orders. There won't be a second time!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, "Since you agreed to help me, I hope you can listen to me. Do your best to follow my instructions. If you really can't, explain why. I don't want you to act on your own!"

None of them spoke.

At this moment, both General Yingwu and Marquis Yunshui felt a bit strange.

Marquis Yunshui looked at General Yingwu, her eyes seemingly speaking.

Is this the pitiful, miserable new Human Lord you mentioned?

Is this the puppet Human Lord you spoke of?

Su Yu, however, ignored them. He gently raised his hand, and a bamboo ring seemed to encircle it. Su Yu chuckled, "Lantian, you heard everything. Put the Chaos Mountain matter on hold and come to me. We might need to handle Marquis Zhennan ourselves!"

"Understood!"

With a light laugh, the void began to ripple.

Su Yu waited for a moment, and the bamboo ring in his hand fell off, gradually taking human form. Soon, the figure became more solid.

After a while, Lantian transformed into a child-like figure, smiling, "Your Majesty Emperor Yu, shall we go subdue that guy now?"

"The sooner, the better!"

Su Yu smiled, "How's Chaos Mountain?"

"Still manageable."

Lantian said, then added with a smile, "Also, Marquis Dingjun has already taken action."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

He glanced at Marquis Yunshui and the others, smiling, "If you don't mind, please wait here for a moment."

Shadow Marquis said solemnly, "Why don't we go together? We can talk to Marquis Zhennan..."

Su Yu actually planned to directly subdue him!

This attitude... doesn't seem like a normal recruitment.

Su Yu smiled, "No need, I'll be back soon. Rest assured, if I can persuade him, I will. Please don't wander around here. If you encounter danger, you can leave first..."

With that, he looked at Lantian and smiled, "Lantian, leave them something to contact us."

Lantian chuckled, the small child plucking some hair from his head, and said with a grin, "Keep these safe, and don't wander off!"

The group frowned, accepting the hair, which quickly wrapped around their wrists like ropes.

"Let's go!"

Su Yu laughed, and the three of them vanished instantly. Tiankuling was in the south, not too far away.

...

After Su Yu and the others left, General Yingwu suddenly said, "Why do I feel like he's not pitiful at all?"

Pitiful?

Shadow Marquis looked at her, somewhat puzzled, "Why would Yingwu say that?"

General Yingwu hesitated, "His strength hasn't reached the quasi-king level. It's said he has three quasi-king subordinates, and even that Zhou Tiansheng seems stronger than him. Plus, he's of noble status, under the Human Emperor... He's young, suppressed by others, and has no say. Isn't that pitiful?"

It seemed quite pitiful indeed. Yet now, there was a vague sense that perhaps he wasn't so pitiful after all. Why?

The newcomer appeared to be at the quasi-king level, yet he was very polite to Su Yu. Whatever Su Yu asked, he did. If told to fight, he fought. If told to come, he came. If told to leave, he left... Even Zhou Tiansheng, now called Zhou Tianqi, was very obedient. Throughout the journey, they were all very courteous to Su Yu.

Shadow Marquis was at a loss for words. After a long pause, he said, "These are just your guesses, Yingwu. I think... we might need to wait and see to understand the situation in the lower realm better."

The group nodded slightly. At this moment, the four of them exchanged glances. After a while, Marquis Huoyun said in a deep voice, "Will Marquis Zhennan agree?"

"It's hard to say."

...

At the same time.

The Great Zhou King asked the same question. Su Yu smiled and said, "Ignore him, just take him down! Suppress him first! I don't have time to persuade him. Suppress him and talk later. Since he's even sending his subordinates to recruit people to save Hundred Battle... willing to do such dangerous things for Hundred Battle, I'm not interested in slowly converting him!"

Su Yu laughed again, "Moreover, with six ancient powerhouses, we need to set an example. Otherwise, they'll think I'm easy to deal with. As for Marquis Zhennan... it's his bad luck. If we can avoid killing him, we won't. We'll suppress him and deal with it after this."

Lantian and the Great Zhou King had no objections.

Lantian laughed playfully, "Then let's take him down. He's not a Heavenly King-level powerhouse. If we join forces, we can take him down in an instant!"

...

Tian Cave Ridge.

Tens of thousands of caves, countless tunnels, all interconnected. At this moment, one enormous cave was brightly lit.

Marquis Zhennan was pacing, frowning. Why hadn't Wen Qi returned yet? Could something have happened? He frowned with some unease. Could the Iron Devourer Race have detained him? It shouldn't be!

Just then, his eyes flickered. From a distant cave, footsteps echoed. Marquis Zhennan's heart trembled, and he called out softly, "Who is it?"

"My lord, it's me!"

Wen Qi!

Marquis Zhennan relaxed slightly. Of course, among these tens of thousands of caves, only Wen Qi knew where he was. Who else could know? Even if they searched, it would take years! Tian Cave Ridge had countless caves. He hadn't even arranged for his subordinates to be together, fearing they might be caught in one fell swoop. He had scattered them across Tian Cave Ridge.

The only one who could come directly to him was Wen Qi. He had just been thinking that this guy had finally returned.

Marquis Zhennan walked out, asking as he went, "Did the Iron Devourer Race agree? Did you meet Marquis Giant Bamboo?"

Outside the cave, Su Yu, disguised as Wen Qi, approached and said, "They agreed, and I met Marquis Giant Bamboo..."

The two were less than a hundred meters apart. As they walked, Marquis Zhennan suddenly felt something was off and asked, "Wen Qi, were you followed?"

"How could I be!"

Su Yu smiled, "My lord, you're overthinking!"

With that smile, Marquis Zhennan's face suddenly changed, and he roared, "You betrayed me?"

He turned to flee, but suddenly, his heart sank. Behind him, the Great Zhou King appeared, smiling, "Don't run!"

Marquis Zhennan's face changed again. He quickly turned his body to run towards another cave, but Lantian appeared, laughing, "No way out here!"

"Scoundrel!"

Marquis Zhennan was furious and charged directly at Su Yu! Damn traitor, he had been betrayed by Wen Qi! He knew Wen Qi's strength. At this moment, he didn't dare run in another direction and headed straight for Su Yu. Kill this traitor!

But Su Yu's hand suddenly revealed a pen. I am not Wen Qi. Wen Qi is still detained. You might as well join him.

With a single stroke, countless pens appeared, heading straight for his Great Dao!

Lantian and the Great Zhou King also erupted with power, the three powerhouses forcibly suppressing him. Lantian's countless avatars transformed into a massive net, descending upon him!

The Great Zhou King used his restraint technique to the fullest, not even shouting, but preventing Marquis Zhennan from making a sound!

Su Yu unleashed his full combat power! He was not weaker than Marquis Zhennan, especially since this guy was being suppressed. Countless pens pierced through, breaking all of Marquis Zhennan's acupoints in the blink of an eye. Marquis Zhennan wanted to roar in disbelief. Who was this guy? Not Wen Qi!

Before he could shout, he saw a small stone flying directly at him. That wasn't all; Su Yu's Human Lord Seal also erupted instantly, suppressing him with the human race's fortune!

"Suppress!"

Su Yu shouted softly. Suppressing a marquis, could it not be done? Not even a Human King, could you withstand the human race's fortune?

Marquis Zhennan's face changed again. What was this? The Human Lord? Impossible! Even if it were, the lower realm's Human Lord, with insufficient human race fortune, how could it suppress him, an ancient marquis? Impossible!

Boom!

With disbelief, the seal descended upon him with a loud crash, pinning him to the ground. The ground was as solid as a divine weapon; he couldn't even burrow into it!

"Don't move. I'm only suppressing you, not killing you!"

Su Yu said calmly, "I am the Human Lord. If you behave, I won't kill you. Don't force me to cut you down!"

Marquis Zhennan struggled violently. Su Yu was not polite, using the giant pen to continuously strike, shattering his body and even extracting much of his blood essence. In the blink of an eye, his aura weakened.

Su Yu smirked, holding the giant pen and continuously inscribing. After a while, he sealed his Great Dao. Then, the Mark of Civilization appeared, absorbing him, and finally, the Sanctification Seal descended.

Su Yu exhaled, "This Mark of Civilization is unusable now!"

Having suppressed three powerhouses, with Wen Qi being the weakest, the remaining two were a second-tier Daofuse and a Heavenly King. For now, the Mark of Civilization couldn't be used anymore.

"Done, let's wrap up!"

Su Yu laughed, "This guy is clearly stubborn! Marquis Dingjun saw the Human Lord Seal and the Culture King's Pen and didn't dare move. Yet, he still dared to struggle!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "That's because Marquis Dingjun is a bit weaker, and this guy is stronger."

Su Yu also laughed, "No matter, as long as he's suppressed! With the Mark of Civilization and the Sanctification Seal, it's hard for him to cause trouble!"

The three exchanged glances and laughed. Their cooperation was seamless. A second-tier Daofuse was taken down with little resistance by their joint efforts.

"Let's go back!"

The three vanished instantly.

...

In less than an hour, Marquis Yunshui and the others were still waiting.

Su Yu appeared, smiling, "He's been suppressed. Now we don't have to worry about trouble!"

The group was shocked! Suppressed? In such a short time, during the journey, Marquis Zhennan was suppressed! There was no time for negotiation at all! Clearly, Su Yu hadn't bothered to talk. He went straight to capture him, right?

The group once again glanced secretly at General Yingwu, especially Marquis Yunshui. At this moment, she couldn't help but want to curse. You said he was pitiful and miserable. Why does it seem like this guy is unimaginably domineering? He directly captured Marquis Zhennan!
