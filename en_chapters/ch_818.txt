Chapter 818: Habitually Trapped (Requesting Subscription)

In the Lower Realm, Su Yu was battling Hundred Battle King.

He avoided direct confrontation, constantly buying time.

Why delay?

Because... Su Yu needed a bit of time to perfect his plan. Some things just couldn't keep up with the changes, and plans needed constant revision.

At this moment.

In the Upper Realm.

Everyone felt an immense weight in their hearts. It seemed a great battle had erupted in the Lower Realm, though they weren't certain.

And then, a change occurred in the Upper Realm.

Suddenly, at the Dao Source Land, the winds surged and clouds roiled.

In the next moment, the Dao Source Land trembled, the power of laws fluctuated, and the Human Emperor's Dao rippled. In the blink of an eye, a scene that blotted out the sky appeared before everyone.

It was... Su Yu and Hundred Battle King!

...

Su Yu: "The Gate of Hell... To bring back the Human Ancestor, you've truly gone mad! Even at the cost of sacrificing the Human Emperor and the others, you beasts!"

"So, when I led people to kill those from the Sin Clan, it must have pained you, right?"

Hundred Battle King: "Not really. Dead is dead. If they don't die, how can we bring out Yu Qing and Po Long, how can we widen the Gate of Hell's crack? It's either them or others... I just didn't expect you to unify the Myriad Realms so quickly!"

"So... you, Hundred Battle King, are the greatest traitor!"

Hundred Battle King: "You're too clever!"

"Perhaps, from the very beginning, from the first tide, your people were in the shadows! You are just the pinnacle of it. Maybe from the first tide, your people were already ambushing those loyal to the Human Emperor!"

"I think... maybe I guessed right!"

"So... the wars of the past hundred thousand years were all caused by you!"

"Countless humans died, countless ancient powerhouses perished! All because of you! The Sin Clan's ancestral teaching is not to let the Culture King return, and maybe it should include not letting the Human Emperor return! Perhaps even the Time Sage was trapped by you!"

Hundred Battle King: "Su Yu, you're really too clever!"

Yes, it was just a few short sentences.

And these few sentences... seemed to have been cut, the scene appeared somewhat blurry, as if it had been repeatedly edited, giving a sense of a cut version.

Hundred Battle King's few "too clever" remarks weren't actually in response to this conversation, but... one must know how to edit!

This massive scene kept appearing above the Dao Source Land, looping continuously.

At this moment, the entire Upper Realm fell into a profound silence.

...

"Impossible!"

Wu Ji and his group were stunned. It couldn't be true!

This couldn't be real!

His Majesty couldn't have done this. He was in the Lower Realm fighting Su Yu, and it seemed the conversation was projected to the Upper Realm, perhaps by Su Yu's methods, or maybe some other means.

In just a few short sentences, Hundred Battle King admitted he was a traitor, admitted that the wars of the past hundred thousand years were actually guided by people of his faction, secretly killing the Human Emperor's secret guards.

Not only that, but Hundred Battle King also seemed to have colluded with the Sin Clan!

Not only colluded, but Hundred Battle King's meaning was that these people died just to bring out Po Long and Yu Qing.

And it seemed that they themselves were also pawns?

At this moment, Wu Ji's expression completely changed!

And Yue Luo and Yue Xiao's expressions also changed dramatically. Before they could say anything, Wu Ji coldly shouted, "Don't move, do you want to die?"

As the scene appeared, in no time, Hong Yue and others surrounded them, and all around, a group of Daofuse and Heavenly Kings were terrified, uneasy, incredulous, and dazed.

Wu Ji looked towards the Dao Source Land, his face growing darker, and he said in a low voice, "Fake... it's all fake!"

He said so, but was it really fake?

The truth couldn't be faked, and the fake couldn't be true!

As for how Su Yu projected these images, Wu Ji didn't know. It might be related to the River of Time, or perhaps the Human Emperor's Dao.

This thing was sealed by Su Yu himself in the Lower Realm, and he held the initiative.

Wu Ji couldn't believe these were true, nor did he want to believe they were true.

But, there was no "what if," no "if only."

If it was true... they were finished!

Beside him, Blood Shadow sighed, looking at Yue Luo and the others, "So... you and His Majesty were on the same side, and we... perhaps from beginning to end, were just pawns! We thought you were pawns, but maybe you've been watching the joke all along, right?"

He spoke with a hint of self-mockery, "His Majesty... why do this? We followed him, and this is the result we get?"

Yue Luo's face was grim, her brows slightly furrowed.

Hundred Battle King's words revealed a lot, and indeed, most of it was true.

At this moment, Yue Luo said in a deep voice, "Everyone... His Majesty has his own purposes. This projection is just taking things out of context... it hasn't revealed the core reason for His Majesty's actions."

The meaning of these words was clearly an admission that everything in the projection was true, but she felt that the key point hadn't been revealed.

When Yue Luo said this, Wu Ji laughed, "Is all this... really what His Majesty said?"

He laughed, but there was a hint of wanting to cry.

He still held onto a sliver of hope that this was fake, but now, Yue Luo's words were telling him that it was all true!

Not only that!

As the projection trembled, over at the Gate of Hell, Yu Qing and the others, their eyes flickered, and soon, figures flew rapidly towards them.

Hundred Battle King and Su Yu were truly at war!

Hundred Battle King had made his move!

Seeing this, Wu Ji actually understood. It was really like this!

Hundred Battle King and Yu Qing were actually on the same side.

Despite countless doubts remaining unanswered, like why Hundred Battle King didn't join forces with the Control King's lineage back then, or what exactly Hundred Battle King wanted to do...

These, he didn't understand.

But at this moment, he knew that they were actually just pawns!

Wu Ji sighed, "So, Hundred Battle King brought us here just to find an opportunity to kill us, and then bring out one or two rulers of laws for the Sin Clan?"

"Years of following... is it really worth so little?"

Hong Yue's face was icy, "Kill them, quickly retreat!"

Wu Ji was still wasting time. At this moment, he should kill Yue Luo and the others and retreat quickly!

Wu Ji sighed, "Retreat? Where to?"

"Go... to Su Human Lord's side!"

Hong Yue said in a low voice, "We... made a mistake! We were wrong six thousand years ago, and now... do we still want to keep making mistakes?"

Hundred Battle King admitted it himself!

In the Lower Realm, killing Su Yu, did he think that by sealing the Lower Realm, he could say whatever he wanted?

But it was projected up here by Su Yu through some unknown means?

They didn't know that it was actually Su Yu who sealed the Lower Realm.

Hundred Battle King was just forced out by Su Yu.

Even if Hundred Battle King didn't say these words, Su Yu could have faked it.

Moreover, Hundred Battle King did say some things, and just a little editing was needed. Su Yu had done this before when the Single Character God Clan killed Su Yu at Starfall Mountain, and the later images spread throughout the Human Realm, also edited.

It was all the fault of the Single Character God Clan, from beginning to end, Su Yu was always the righteous and glorious figure.

Some things, once done repeatedly, become second nature.

...

At this moment, over at Ren Mountain.

The myriad races' powerhouses looked at the sky, each with a peculiar expression, internal strife!

The human race was in internal strife!

Hundred Battle King and Su Yu were truly fighting.

What shocked them even more was that Hundred Battle King and the Control King's lineage were actually on the same side. Six thousand years ago, they didn't deal with the myriad races, which was unexpected. It meant that over the years, their survival was purely luck!

Over at the Emperor Yu's Mansion, there was some unrest.

But fortunately, the fact that such a scene could appear at the Dao Source Land clearly indicated that Su Yu was behind it, which meant Su Yu hadn't reached the point of being unable to resist. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to project all this up here.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King and others weren't focusing on the myriad races but were looking towards Wu Ji and the others.

Wan Tiansheng said in a deep voice, "Wu Ji and the others are in danger! Should we rescue them? His Majesty's intention is probably to subdue them, otherwise, he wouldn't have projected this up here!"

If that were the case, there was no need.

Since it was projected up here, it wasn't for them to see, but for Wu Ji and the others to see.

The others didn't need to see these.

The Great Zhou King glanced over there. Wu Ji and the others, Yue Luo, Yue Xiao, and Thunderstorm, Wu Ji's group probably couldn't take them down, let alone the many powerhouses from the Sin Clan.

Two rulers of laws... once they joined the battle, it would be a huge problem!

But rescuing them wouldn't be easy.

If the myriad races held them back, it would also be a huge problem.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King frowned slightly. Usually, Su Yu would meticulously instruct them on how to respond and what to do, but this time, Su Yu said very little. Why was that?

How could they suppress the myriad races in such a situation?

As for the myriad races being captured, those captured were all on Su Yu's side!

Should they reveal now that their people were captured?

But at this point, would it be useful?

The Great Zhou King's mind was racing, trying to figure out what kind of result His Majesty wanted.

This, he didn't know.

He really didn't know!

The Great Zhou King quickly assessed the situation and soon shouted, "Undead King, Fat Ball, Tongtian, quickly go to the rescue!"

Three great powerhouses should go to the rescue first!

As for how the myriad races would choose... he didn't know, but they would likely obstruct them because this was the myriad races' only chance.

The Great Zhou King was also quite troubled!

...

At this moment, atop Ren Mountain.

As several powerhouses made their move, Sun Corona and the others' eyes lit up, "Stop them! Quickly, this is the only chance!"

The opportunity had come!

This time, Su Yu was truly engaged in a three-way battle.

They hadn't expected to actually wait for the result!

Waited for the change!

Choosing to compromise earlier was the right choice, otherwise, they would have been wiped out long ago. Indeed, Tiangu's decision was correct.

And at this moment, Tiangu was also moved, just about to say something when his expression suddenly changed, "No, wait..."

"What?"

Sun Corona and the others were in disbelief!

"You're still waiting at a time like this?" Arrogant Heavenly Venerable roared in anger. "If we wait for them to reinforce, and they manage to crush the Control King's faction, our end will be near!"

Tiangu furrowed his brows. "Hold on a moment... Su Yu wouldn't overlook such things. Otherwise, he wouldn't have projected himself here. We mustn't act rashly..."

"You're scared out of your wits by Su Yu!" Arrogant Heavenly Venerable shouted. "Tiangu, this is our only chance! If we miss this, we won't have any opportunity left!"

Damn it!

Tiangu wanted to say more, but Arrogant Heavenly Venerable interrupted, "Charge out! If you don't want to die at the hands of Su Yu and his people, then cooperate with the Control King's faction now and eliminate these guys. It's our only chance. The Control King's faction and Hundred Battle King haven't acted against us for years... They must have their own plans. Only Su Yu is determined to wipe us out!"

His speculation wasn't entirely wrong.

At this moment, some of the other Heavenly Venerables were showing signs of movement, looking towards the Divine Empress and Tiangu.

Tiangu was deeply troubled!

Would Su Yu really put himself in such a desperate and dangerous situation?

But... Su Yu was entangled, and the Martial Emperor seemed to be drawn away. All of Su Yu's strength was here.

So... where exactly was the problem?

He couldn't figure it out!

Looking at the Great Zhou King, some appeared panicked, probably not expecting such an outcome.

"What's wrong here?"

But now, there was no time for him to think. Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others were all restless, and Tiangu suspected that if he tried to stop them now, the myriad races might end up in internal conflict.

Once again, he was put on the spot!

Below, those in the Daofuse Realm, who were probably scared before, now saw hope from despair and shouted loudly, "Charge out!"

Charging out now still held a chance!

Tiangu wanted to shout, "Don't rush, wait a bit longer!"

Su Yu isn't that simple!

But... the crowd was surging, and he couldn't oppose them.

Before Tiangu could speak, even the Saint Marquis beside him, who had always supported him, softly said, "Charge out! Your Highness, if we wait any longer, something might go wrong. We've finally waited for this opportunity!"

"But..."

Dao Heavenly Venerable directly interrupted, "Tiangu, stop hesitating. Are you waiting to be slaughtered by Su Yu and his people?"

Having said this much, Tiangu frowned, feeling helpless!

If he continued to block them, morale would completely collapse!

"Forget it!"

Tiangu sighed inwardly. It's really not that simple!

Su Yu isn't someone who would put himself in a dead-end!

He even suspected that the so-called lower realm seal was Su Yu's own doing!

The possibility was too high!

But at this point, there was no choice.

Tiangu closed his eyes for a moment, gritted his teeth, and shouted, "Deploy! Kill!"

Block Su Yu's side from reinforcing!

Even if they go, they can't send too many.

The Control King's faction should come to deal with Su Yu's people after killing Wu Ji and the others.

Even as he said this, Tiangu quickly transmitted to several Heavenly Venerables, "Focus on entanglement, don't really go for the kill... Otherwise, I'm worried..."

Before he could finish, Arrogant Heavenly Venerable and the others had already charged out with their people!

They were also speechless about Tiangu.

At this point, why was he still so indecisive?

Now, the opportunity had come. Isn't this what we've been waiting for?

Tiangu, feeling helpless, quickly transmitted to the Divine Empress, "Empress, things aren't that simple. Su Yu allowed you to succeed in continuing the Dao, knowing full well the trouble it would cause. Now, he's projecting himself to the upper realm, actively creating a full-scale war with the three factions... This is very inappropriate!"

The Divine Empress was also heavy-hearted. Yes, she had similar concerns, but at this point, she couldn't control everyone and make them wait.

"I understand. Be cautious. As you said, focus on entanglement and see the outcome between the Sin Clan and Su Yu's side..."

The Divine Empress said no more and quickly flew out, soon meeting with several people flying towards her.

The Divine Empress said in a deep voice, "Those three can go over. I think the others should rest here for a while. I have no intention of fighting with you all..."

She also left a backup plan!

If the Undead Emperor and the others went, she wouldn't stop them, nor could she. But at this moment, she didn't want to start a war with Su Yu's side. It would be better to just entangle them here.

As for the outcome... let fate decide!

On the other side, Arrogant Heavenly Venerable and a few others quickly engaged in battle with some of the human race's strong fighters.

Below, those in the Daofuse Realm also quickly charged out, engaging in battle with the human race's Daofuse Realm fighters.

The Great Zhou King, stationed in the void, quickly commanded, "His Majesty has been merciful to the myriad races, never exterminating you. Now you seek your own destruction. Even if the Sin Clan and Hundred Battle King rebel and join forces, they cannot change anything. Everyone, take care of yourselves!"

"Hmph!"

A cold snort echoed, and the next moment, Arrogant Heavenly Venerable quickly charged at him!

On Su Yu's side, there were 13 Heavenly Venerables and 1 Ruler of Laws.

Now, with the Undead Emperor, Fat Ball, and Tongtian gone, only 11 Heavenly Venerable-level existences remained.

On the myriad races' side, there were also 9 Heavenly Venerables and 1 Ruler of Laws.

The Divine Empress directly blocked the South Heavenly King and Wan Tiansheng. Although they didn't fight, the other 9 had the opportunity to suppress one-on-one. Sun Corona and Saint Marquis were strong, and with the powerful Fat Ball gone and the South Heavenly King matched with a Ruler of Laws, the remaining people found it hard to match Saint Marquis and Sun Corona.

The Chaos Dragon could fight, but this guy seemed to be slacking off, only restraining two Heavenly Venerables with the Eight-Winged Tiger, not daring to run but also not going all out.

Suddenly, the myriad races gained the upper hand!

Fortunately, on Su Yu's side, there were top-tier existences like Marquis Lanshan and Heavenly Fire, who were quite strong. Together, they could still restrain these Heavenly Venerables.

At this moment, although everyone wasn't clear on what Su Yu was planning, they had to give their all to stop the myriad races!

...

Deep within Chaos Mountain.

Yu Qing and the others sensed the strong fighters of the myriad races charging out to block Su Yu's side and immediately smiled.

Their speed instantly increased.

Yu Qing shouted, "Yue Luo, you all hold them back. Don't let them escape. Kill them!"

Wu Ji and these Heavenly Venerables, along with some Heavenly Kings and Daofuse Realm fighters, if all killed, could definitely bring in one or two Rulers of Laws.

Yu Qing's speed was fast, and the Granny Dragon Beast laughed heartily.

Su Yu's side was finished!

Su Yu himself was foolish, fighting with Hundred Battle King in the lower realm. Otherwise, Hundred Battle King might not have dealt with Su Yu so quickly.

Two Rulers of Laws, plus someone like Moon Battle, who was close to a Ruler of Laws, and Mo Heavenly Venerable, even if the Undead Emperor and the others came, it wouldn't be enough!

With Tongtian here, they arrived quickly.

In the blink of an eye, the three appeared before them.

Yu Qing coldly looked at them, "You want to stop me too?"

She instantly charged at the Undead Emperor, Moon Battle automatically faced Fat Ball, and Mo Heavenly Venerable tangled with Tongtian. The Granny Dragon Beast was about to make a move when Yu Qing shouted, "Granny Dragon, go help Yue Luo kill those people. We'll hold these guys... This time, leave none alive!"

Killing these few would allow them to bring in three Rulers of Laws without any problem!

Although the Granny Dragon wanted to take out Su Yu's people first, there was still a Ruler of Laws here, making it not so easy to kill. Wu Ji and the others were much easier to kill. Without saying more, he laughed heartily and quickly broke through the air, charging at Wu Ji and the others!

...

On Wu Ji's side, they had long been unable to hold back, and the six Heavenly Venerables quickly engaged in battle.

Wu Ji faced Yue Luo, Red Moon faced Moon Howl, and Blood Shadow faced Thunderstorm.

At this moment, Wu Ji was furious, gritting his teeth, "I knew you, ugly woman, had bad intentions. I didn't expect you to really collude with them... Damn it, I'll kill you!"

Yue Luo was not weak, comparable to him, but had been seriously injured by the Martial Emperor's punch before. Now, under his wild and open attacks, she was being beaten back step by step!

Around them, those Heavenly Kings and Daofuse Realm fighters, some were in despair, some were sorrowful, and some gritted their teeth and charged at the three!

But... some stood on Yue Luo's side.

Someone quickly shouted, "It's all fake... all fabricated by Su Yu. It's not His Majesty's true intention... Stop them..."

Over 20 Daofuse Realm fighters, five or six also fought hard, blocking those trying to surround Yue Luo and the others.

Suddenly, it was complete chaos!

The upper realm, which had been merely a standoff, instantly descended into a chaotic battle.

Red Moon shouted harshly, "Hurry and kill them, then retreat!"

The Granny Dragon was coming!

They couldn't stop him!

This one was very strong, terrifyingly strong!

And on Su Yu's side, they had already sent three strong fighters for reinforcement. Sending more was clearly not feasible. If they did, they would fall into a disadvantage against the myriad races.

Clearly, everything had been going smoothly before, and they could suppress both sides!

Why... did it suddenly change?

In the crowd, Marquis Zhennan was also full of despair. "I thought that even if His Majesty didn't get along with Su Yu, he would wait until the myriad races and Sin Clan were destroyed before turning against him... Why is it like this? The human race hasn't won yet... Must it be like this?"

He knew that Hundred Battle King might turn against Su Yu, but in his view, that should happen at the last moment, after resolving other troubles, before dealing with Su Yu.

Not now!

"Your Majesty..."

A shrill scream, and the next moment, Marquis Zhennan's aura grew stronger, roaring, "No, he is no longer the Human Lord, nor is he our human race's Hundred Battle King. He is a traitor! A traitor to the human race! Kill the traitor!"

The more he had admired him in the past, the more he hated him now.

He still admired Hundred Battle King!

Because Hundred Battle King was truly strong, and he had been very charismatic back then. Even if he was an enemy of Su Yu, he actually stood with Hundred Battle King, as long as Hundred Battle King's goal was to strengthen the human race, even if he thought Su Yu wasn't wrong... But last time he met Su Yu, he also said, during the battle, there was no need to hold back.

Both sides, it was just a difference in philosophy!

But at this moment, it wasn't just a difference in philosophy!

Hundred Battle King was a complete fraud, a traitor. His goal wasn't to strengthen the human race!

Chapter 1: The Betrayal

The words of the Hundred Battle King shattered everything he believed in. The Hundred Battle King had long forgotten the Human Race, even secretly harming them. At this moment, Marquis Zhennan was utterly despairing and completely disheartened.

"Kill!"

Marquis Zhennan was powerful, having advanced to the Heavenly King realm long ago. His strength had previously surpassed that of Marquis Huoyun. Although he hadn't reached the level of a Heavenly Venerable, he was not far off. With a single spear strike, he killed a Daofuse cultivator blocking their path.

Beside him, Marquis Nanxi sighed softly, "Round and round... it turns out we were wrong!"

There was a sense of sorrow. 

When Su Yu rescued them that day, they thought that no matter how strong Su Yu was, he couldn't compare to the Hundred Battle King. But who would have thought that not long after, the Hundred Battle King would reveal his true colors as a traitor?

Ironically, Su Yu turned out to be the only hope for the Human Race. 

Among those rescued, only Giant Axe and Xuelan chose to side with Su Yu. Xuelan's allegiance came later. 

Even if they were mere projections, people might not believe it. But with the presence of Yue Luo and others blocking them, and the arrival of the Brolong, disbelief was no longer an option.

"Hundred Battle King!"

At this moment, Wu Ji roared in anger, delivering a punch that made Yue Luo vomit blood, shattering his physical body. Wu Ji's aura suddenly surged, and he gritted his teeth, "I'll intercept Brolong. You all join forces... kill these people! Even if we die, we must slaughter them! Hundred Battle King... you beast!"

The greater the hope, the greater the despair.

Back then, they abandoned everything for the Hundred Battle King's plan, following him, sacrificing countless lives, even watching old comrades die on the battlefield due to differing beliefs.

They were guilty!

Yet, they believed there was still hope, that today's sacrifices were for a better tomorrow.

But now... such illusions were shattered!

Wu Ji's aura grew stronger, quickly ascending into the sky, looking at Brolong with determination, gritting his teeth, "Come fight!"

In the distance, Brolong looked on with disdain.

How laughable!

Not even a Ruler of Laws, yet daring to block him?

Can he be stopped?

"Then you shall die, ungrateful fool!"

In an instant, Brolong charged at him, his wings flashing, and with a slash, Wu Ji's spear broke, leaving a deep, bone-revealing wound on his chest. The gap was too vast!

Wu Ji roared, his blood and qi surging, and with a furious shout, he charged at Brolong with his fists!

Hold on for a while!

If those behind can kill Yue Luo and the others, even if they can't defeat Brolong, there's hope for escape. He roared, "Kill them, retreat! Tongtian... take them away... we were wrong before... I will hold Brolong back!"

Stop fighting!

Find a chance to retreat!

Gather together, and even the Myriad Races and Sin Race may not dare to fight to the death!

...

In the Upper Realm, the battle raged on.

In the Lower Realm.

Su Yu kept fleeing, constantly entangling, always with a smile.

When he sensed something, felt his power of laws being consumed... it wasn't him consuming it, but the battle in the Upper Realm. Those integrated into his world were consuming it, and Su Yu knew the great battle had erupted!

The Myriad Races indeed came out to block them.

"Very well!"

Su Yu smiled, looking at the distant Hundred Battle King. At this moment, Su Yu was slightly injured, while the Hundred Battle King's face was cold and stern, relentlessly pursuing Su Yu. Yet, Su Yu was cunning, willing to pay a price to shake off his pursuit.

Su Yu smiled and said, "Hundred Battle King, it seems the Upper Realm is in chaos... do you think your people will win, or will mine?"

The Hundred Battle King coldly replied, "You seal the Lower Realm and oppose me, courting death!"

Is there even a need to guess?

The Control King's lineage has two Rulers of Laws; there's no need to guess.

Once he makes a move, the Myriad Races will surely intervene, so naturally, victory is assured!

Su Yu's side is fighting against three sides!

"Indeed... but I want to see for myself..."

Su Yu laughed, "Fighting in the Lower Realm is boring. Why not go to the Upper Realm and see? If your people win, they can join forces to kill me. If they lose... then my people will join forces to kill you!"

The Hundred Battle King's eyes flickered, looking at Su Yu. Had he forgotten that Changqing and Changmei couldn't intervene in their battle at the moment?

However, once they reached the Upper Realm, they couldn't deal with Su Yu, but with the addition of two Heavenly Venerables, there was a way to deal with Su Yu's subordinates!

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King truly didn't understand Su Yu.

Was Su Yu really unafraid?

The Hundred Battle King's eyes flickered, and he said faintly, "Su Yu, what are you expecting? What are you waiting for? Do you think the Martial Emperor can return soon?"

He coldly said, "Since Ji'er has led him away, the Martial Emperor won't be back anytime soon!"

"I know, the Martial Emperor is an idiot... he might even get lost!"

Su Yu laughed, "I just think that if we fight here, no one will cry for me if I die... too pitiful. If I go up there, at least someone will cry for me if I die... a bit more comforting!"

Before the Hundred Battle King could speak, Su Yu struck the heavens and earth with a palm, withdrawing the rules he had previously sealed. In an instant, the Lower and Upper Realms were reconnected.

The Hundred Battle King's Human Gate could actually be sealed again.

But at this moment, the Hundred Battle King was also unsure of Su Yu's intentions. After thinking carefully, even if they went to the Upper Realm... his side wouldn't weaken; instead, Changqing and the others would have a place to use their skills!

What was Su Yu plotting?

With such doubts, he didn't stop Su Yu. Since Su Yu wanted to go, he would accompany him!

Adding two Heavenly Venerables and several Heavenly Kings was also a good thing.

Moreover, if he went up, he might have enough deterrence to prevent Wu Ji and the others from believing Su Yu's nonsense!

With this thought, the Hundred Battle King didn't stop him.

And Su Yu, seeing this, laughed heartily, instantly breaking through the heavens and earth, reaching the endless void, the entrance to the Soul Burying Mountain, and quickly charging upwards, while the Hundred Battle King also led his people in swift pursuit.

In almost the blink of an eye, both sides entered the Upper Realm one after the other!

...

In the Upper Realm.

The great battle was erupting when suddenly, a powerful aura surged, startling all sides. In the next moment, another aura rose, followed by the Hundred Battle King's voice, "Changqing, Changmei... go assist Yue Luo and the others!"

With that, the Hundred Battle King's voice shook the heavens, "Wu Ji, Hong Yue, what are you doing? Are you going to side with this traitor Su Yu?"

Ahead, Su Yu was quickly fleeing, coughing and gasping, shouting, "Kill! Today, let's turn the heavens and earth upside down, fight to the death! Even if I die, I'll stop the Hundred Battle King... he's not of the Human Race... Hundred Battle King... cough, cough... Hundred Battle King and us, we're not of the same race..."

These words caused a stir among the crowd.

The Great Zhou King and others looked towards Su Yu. At this moment, Su Yu was fleeing, while behind him, the Hundred Battle King was in pursuit.

Changqing and Changmei, however, were leading their people swiftly towards Wu Ji and the others.

Two Heavenly Venerables, several Heavenly Kings, and over a dozen Daofuse cultivators!

In an instant, Su Yu's arrival not only failed to reverse anything but made the Hundred Battle King's side even stronger!

If Wu Ji and the others were killed, and another Ruler of Laws emerged, today's battle would be completely unwinnable.

...

"Has Su Yu... really lost?"

At this moment, Tiangu, watching Su Yu flee, frowned slightly, still feeling something was amiss.

But at this point, Su Yu's side was already doomed!

How could he turn the tables?

And at this moment, Su Yu shouted, "Strong ones of the Myriad Races, help me kill the enemy! I've captured all your clansmen in the Lower Realm. If you don't help me, if I die, they will die too!"

These words sent a shock through Tiangu's heart, and the faces of Saint Marquis and the others changed. In the next moment, Saint Marquis angrily said, "Su Yu, you demon, do you think you can succeed? Even if you've captured them... after this battle, you will surely lose. We still have forces in the Upper Realm, but your Human Race will be annihilated!"

Su Yu had captured their clansmen in the Lower Realm!

This demon, does he really not care about anything?

But at this point, how could they help Su Yu?

Su Yu's side was clearly at a disadvantage, and Su Yu acted recklessly. It would be better to destroy them. As for the clans... everyone was reluctant, but there were still legacies in the Upper Realm. If they were truly destroyed... they could only rely on those in the Upper Realm, unless the Upper Realm was also destroyed. Otherwise, there had to be sacrifices!

"You're really heartless!"

Su Yu shouted as he fled, "Aren't you afraid the Upper Realm will be destroyed too? Do you think the Hundred Battle King will spare you? Fools! Cooperate with me, and I'll leave you some foundation!"

At this moment, no one paid him any mind!

Now was not the time to be threatened by Su Yu!

...

And as Su Yu fled, he watched and observed.

There were indeed a few from the Myriad Races fighting fiercely, charging ahead.

Wu Ji's side was about to fall. His combat power erupted, burning his blood and qi, making him not weak, but unfortunately, he faced Brolong, who almost crushed him. If not for Wu Ji's desperate efforts, he would have been killed long ago!

"Truly pitiful!"

But no sympathy!

If they die, they deserve it!

Behind him, the Hundred Battle King kept frowning. Su Yu, this guy, came up and pretended to be miserable. Was it necessary?

He wasn't that miserable. In the Lower Realm, although he was injured, it was just a minor injury to Su Yu!

At this point, he still didn't understand what Su Yu was plotting.

And Su Yu, seeing that the situation was about right, suddenly grew stronger, his voice turning cold, "Is it about time? Great Zhou King, hear my command, kill half of the Myriad Races' Heavenly Venerables! Slaughter the Myriad Races on Ren Mountain until none remain!"

The Great Zhou King and others were stunned. What kind of joke was this?

It's hard enough to maintain balance. If we could kill them, we would have done so long ago!

But Tiangu's brow twitched violently, feeling an extreme sense of unease!

Su Yu's cold voice rose again, "Kill until the strong ones of the Myriad Races agree to help me destroy the Sin Race, or else... keep killing!"

He spoke as if it were true!

The Heavenly Venerables of the Desolate Heaven were almost laughing. Was Su Yu so devastated that he was going mad?

Could he even say such things?

Why should we help you?

Who do you think you are?

"Merge!"

A loud shout echoed, and in the next moment, Su Yu unleashed the full power of the Great Dao within his world. The Book of Time instantly merged into his world, leaving only a cover with a recipe on it. Everything else was absorbed!

In that instant, the aura of the South Heavenly King surged with power! Marquis Lanshan instantly reached the level of a Heavenly Venerable, and Tianhuo also ascended to the same level!

But that wasn't all. The Great Qin King, the Great Xia King... all the powerful beings integrated into Su Yu's world experienced a sudden surge in strength!

The West King's Consort even reached the peak of the Heavenly Venerable level, faintly advancing towards the status of a ruler of laws... In fact, within Su Yu's world, she was already a ruler of laws, though outside, she couldn't advance further!

In the blink of an eye, several new Heavenly Venerables emerged. Marquis Lanshan and Tianhuo became Heavenly Venerables, and even Xuelan and Marquis Giant Bamboo exuded a Heavenly Venerable aura. The South Heavenly King, in particular, seemed to possess the power of a ruler of laws, having become a true ruler of laws within Su Yu's world!

All other Daofuse cultivators experienced significant improvements!

In just a moment, the combat power under Su Yu's command doubled!

And that wasn't all... At that moment, a projection of a world instantly covered Ren Mountain!

The Divine Empress's face changed dramatically!

But it was too late to stop it. The massive world enveloped the entire Ren Mountain!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded as the area around Ren Mountain was directly covered by the world!

In the rear, Hundred Battle was shocked and exclaimed, "How is this possible? How can your world invade the Upper Realm..."

When did Su Yu's world move here?

This wasn't just a projection of a world; it represented that Su Yu's world was nearby!

Logically, his world should only exist in chaos.

Su Yu wore a simple smile, "Well... I forgot to tell you, Ren Mountain... is actually a great mountain from chaos. Didn't everyone know that? No, I remember someone told me on the first day that Ren Mountain was a great mountain moved from chaos by the Culture King and others. This is chaos too!"

Su Yu chuckled, "I've been moving house every day, it's exhausting... You guys didn't know? What a pity! Ren Mountain is a great place! The myriad races actually chose Ren Mountain as their territory... I really have to thank their ancestors!"

Ren Mountain is truly wonderful, I love it.

It's a chaotic mountain!

Huh, did no one know?

Su Yu looked innocent, "Strange, how could you not know? Everyone knows Ren Mountain is a chaotic mountain, aren't you... too foolish?"

Hundred Battle cursed inwardly!

We know!

Yet, he was still shocked, "The Upper Realm is the Human Emperor's land of creation. With the clash of worlds, you can't invade the Upper Realm, and the Dao Source Land has no reaction..."

He indeed knew many things.

And Su Yu, always willing to help, nodded and smiled innocently, "Yes, but... the Human Emperor is a kind person. When he saw my Human Lord Seal was so powerful, he knew I was the Human Lord, so... he didn't care! Don't you know the Human Emperor is a simple, kind person? As long as it's good for the human race, he doesn't care about the Great Dao. He even wanted to give it to me, but I didn't take it... I remember I mentioned this too?"

Did I not say it?

Alright, maybe Hundred Battle didn't know, but the Great Zhou King and others did.

There would be conflict!

Both are creators, and Su Yu is invading the Human Emperor's territory, how could there not be conflict?

But the Human Emperor... is a good person!

I just like to bully honest people!

...

"Achoo!"

At this moment, upstream of the River of Time, a phantom suddenly sneezed, causing a great disturbance all around. What was going on?

You're a supreme being!

The phantom muttered, "I seem to have been cursed, and it's by some bastard who took my benefits and still curses me... It's not the first time! Turns his back and doesn't recognize people!"

That brat, invading my domain, I couldn't be bothered to deal with him, let him invade.

After all, he knew that brat was the one who didn't even want the power of the Great Dao I gave him last time.

Invading the domain... for my sister's sake, I couldn't be bothered. I didn't even prepare the Great Dao for him, just gave it to him, and he didn't want it, so invading the domain isn't a big deal.

But why do I feel like this brat not only isn't grateful but seems to be cursing me for being stupid?

Damn your ancestors!

Is this something a person would do?

"The Myriad Realms... have undergone great changes!"

The phantom muttered, and soon, his gaze turned to Xingyue, muttering, "Is he really crippled?"

Crippled my ass!

He even wants to invade my domain, does that look crippled?

Why do I feel like my sister is deceiving me?

What exactly is going on in the Myriad Realms? Even now, he's confused and can't guess!

Also, why is this brat invading my domain?

Chaos is so vast, you can place your world anywhere, why insist on taking mine? Is the territory I opened up more fragrant?

In this regard, even the Human Emperor couldn't understand.

What exactly is this brat doing?

Recently, there's been constant commotion, and although he's used to being tricked, this unseen brat won't trick me big time, right?
