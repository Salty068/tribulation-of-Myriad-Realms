Chapter 742: Isn't Cooperation Better?

Three beams of light pierced through the void.

Ahead, the Six-Winged was incredibly fast, each flap of its six wings propelling it thousands of miles forward. Behind, Moon Heavenly Venerable's face was twisted with rage as he roared, "Six-Winged, why?"

He couldn't understand!

The Six-Winged had been dormant for many years and had no enmity with the Divine Race. Why would it kill its own kind without reason?

Pseudo Dao!

He vaguely sensed that it was related to the Pseudo Dao. Perhaps there was something wrong with the Six-Winged's path. Recently, issues with the Pseudo Dao had been frequent, unsettling Moon Heavenly Venerable. Chasing the Six-Winged was also a means to uncover the truth, as it wasn't the only one practicing the Pseudo Dao. Perhaps a third of the myriad races' experts were cultivating it.

What happened to the Six-Winged?

The Bone-Winged Marquis had self-destructed, yet the Six-Winged survived. Capturing it might reveal what truly transpired.

As he pursued, Moon Heavenly Venerable shouted, "Six-Winged, stop! I won't kill you. I know you have your reasons. Your path might be flawed. If you cooperate, we'll save you!"

He couldn't help but curse!

The Six-Winged was too fast!

That fellow was a quasi-king, on par with him in realm, and speed was its forte. At this moment, he felt he was barely keeping up.

Ahead, the Six-Winged's eyes were blood-red. With a cold smile, it retained some sanity and spoke, "You won't kill me? Who are you to say that? Moon Eclipse, back then, you were nothing but a dog before me. Even your brother, Sun Corona, wasn't qualified to command me. Now, after all I've done for the Divine Race, you say you won't kill me? Who are you to say that?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable was infuriated. What was going on with this guy?

Behind, Demon Heavenly Venerable was also in hot pursuit, his voice echoing, "Moon Heavenly Venerable, let's capture him first! His Dao might truly be flawed. Perhaps all paths in the Dao Source Land have issues!"

This was serious!

If unresolved, many experts among the myriad races would live in fear. This couldn't be leaked, or it would cause chaos!

Demon Heavenly Venerable was even more worried. What if these Pseudo Dao experts suddenly turned traitor at a critical moment?

That would be far more severe than losing a few Daofuse experts!

If the news got out, it would cause widespread panic.

No matter what, the Six-Winged must be captured.

They even pondered whether the Pseudo Dao could be controlled. If it could... each faction had Pseudo Dao experts. If they could control them, it would be terrifying.

Thus, Demon Heavenly Venerable, thinking of these things, accelerated his pursuit!

Despite being injured by the Bone-Winged Marquis's self-destruction, he couldn't care less. Without capturing the Six-Winged and uncovering the truth, he wouldn't be at ease.

...

Behind them.

Su Yu was filled with emotions. They were fast.

These guys were all faster than him.

Terrifying fellows, that Six-Winged Divine Race guy was fast too. Encountering him alone would be tough.

In martial arts, speed is invincible.

With such speed, one gains an advantage in battle.

"Two Heavenly Venerables... seems impossible to deal with."

If it were just one, the Six-Winged's self-destruction might heavily injure him. With Blue Sky's help, there was hope to take him down. But two... forget it. If the Six-Winged was caught by these two, self-destruction would be useless!

Even though it seemed there was no chance to kill, Su Yu still quickly followed.

Ahead, they encountered a migrating team. The team had only one weak Daofuse leader. Sensing the approaching aura, he was about to lead his people away when the Six-Winged, eyes crazed, flashed by, and a massive head fell!

The Daofuse expert, about to leave, had his head severed by the Six-Winged's wings in an instant.

"Six-Winged!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable shouted angrily, then roared, "The Six-Winged has betrayed us. Everyone, beware of the Six-Winged!"

He had to speak up!

Otherwise, if the Six-Winged continued killing, the Divine Race would take the blame.

The three powerful figures vanished in a flash.

The myriad races' experts left behind were all trembling with fear.

The decapitated Daofuse expert suddenly revived, his heart pounding. The Three Body Method allowed him to survive three times!

Though he had been killed once, he could still revive!

He was terrified!

The Six-Winged had been too fast. He hadn't even had time to escape.

Though he lost one life, weakening his strength, he at least survived.

As he was thinking, his face suddenly changed, and everything went black!

In the next moment, a massive seal smashed onto his head.

His second body was instantly shattered!

The Mark of Civilization blotted out the sky. The myriad races' experts were instantly swallowed by it. Now, Su Yu's Mark of Civilization was incredibly powerful, with a third-tier Daofuse demon inside, far beyond what these guys could handle.

In an instant, over ten thousand beings were captured. Those below the Eternal level perished instantly, their blood essence devoured by the Mark of Civilization.

The Daofuse expert, having just revived his third body, was struck by Su Yu's pen, his physical form shattered in the blink of an eye.

With two bodies destroyed, his strength was only comparable to a top-tier Eternal.

Facing a Heavenly King like Su Yu, how could he compete?

His shattered body was devoured by the Mark of Civilization, leaving only his sea of will, which Su Yu suppressed into the Mark.

With a casual swipe, Su Yu erased all traces of himself, smiled, and vanished.

Not bad!

While they fought upfront, I picked up some benefits and let them take the blame.

Whether the myriad races believed it or not, or how many loopholes there were, wasn't Su Yu's concern. Let Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others prove it wasn't them.

...

The chase continued.

Su Yu was left further and further behind.

It seemed the two sides had begun to clash, as Su Yu sensed some fluctuations.

At this moment, someone emerged from beneath Su Yu's feet, transforming into a bamboo ring that wrapped around his hand, speaking, "I've sensed their aura. We're not far from the Phoenix Race!"

Blue Sky, puzzled, asked, "The first one to discover the Divine Race?"

"It's him!"

Su Yu nodded. Blue Sky was surprised, "He really has some skill. I thought he self-destructed, but he actually escaped. What happened? Didn't it affect him?"

"His willpower is strong. It only disrupted his judgment, leaving him with some sanity."

"Do we kill the Heavenly Venerable?"

Blue Sky quickly asked, "It's too difficult. I sense two Heavenly Venerables. Unless we call back all of the Heavenly Saints, it's nearly impossible!"

Almost hopeless!

"No rush, let's see."

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry. He'd wait for the encounter ahead and assess the situation. If the opportunity was right, he'd make his move.

...

Boom!

Near a towering mountain, Moon Heavenly Venerable finally intercepted the Six-Winged.

At this moment, the Six-Winged's eyes were wild, tinged with a blood-red aura. Its six wings flapped, tearing through the void as it charged at Moon Heavenly Venerable with reckless abandon!

Moon Heavenly Venerable was powerful, his palm striking out, causing sparks to fly in the void from the Six-Winged's wings.

Behind, Demon Heavenly Venerable was also closing in rapidly.

With a single hand covering the sky, Demon Heavenly Venerable reached for the Six-Winged.

Two Heavenly Venerables working together—how could the Six-Winged resist?

Seeing the Six-Winged's eyes turning blood-red, showing signs of self-destruction, Moon Heavenly Venerable felt a murderous impulse, gritting his teeth, then once again donned a divine smile, "Six-Winged, don't self-destruct. I'm here to save you, not kill you!"

Demon Heavenly Venerable's expression shifted, glancing at Moon Heavenly Venerable.

Everything was understood without words!

The two wanted to capture the Six-Winged alive!

They wanted to investigate why the Six-Winged had become like this.

Where did that reckless will come from?

The Six-Winged's eyes flickered, looking at Moon Heavenly Venerable, feeling a strange closeness. In the next moment, the madness once again filled its mind.

The more it absorbed the power of laws, the more insane it became!

"Kill!"

The Six-Winged instantly broke free from Moon Heavenly Venerable's control, charging at him. Before Moon Heavenly Venerable could act, it suddenly turned and fled, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Moon Heavenly Venerable cursed inwardly, transmitting, "Demon Heavenly Venerable, this is an internal matter of the Divine Race. You don't need to interfere. I'll handle it myself."

"How could that be!"

Demon Heavenly Venerable wouldn't agree!

At this moment, the Six-Winged wasn't just a rebellious quasi-king. It might hold the secret of the Dao Source Land's paths!

The two exchanged a glance, and Moon Heavenly Venerable cursed inwardly!

Damn it!

Without further words, they continued the pursuit.

...

They had just left when Su Yu arrived quickly, frowning slightly, puzzled, "They intercepted the Six-Winged, yet it wasn't killed or self-destructed?"

Two Heavenly Venerables, and they couldn't kill a Heavenly King?

Killing one-on-one might be tough, but two-on-one, how could it be difficult?

Blue Sky was also puzzled, a clone speaking, "It seems they don't want to kill this guy."

Su Yu thought for a moment. It seemed so!

They didn't want to kill...

His eyes flickered, and Su Yu nodded, "Perhaps they really don't want to kill. But why?"

Thinking carefully, he quickly followed, transmitting to Blue Sky, "Let's see. If they catch up again and still don't kill the Six-Winged, it means they want to capture him alive. Capture him alive... could it be they want to know if the Six-Winged is controlled? If Pseudo Dao experts can be controlled?"

Su Yu speculated, though it might not be accurate, he felt it was close!

Perhaps that's it!

Two Pseudo Dao experts rebelling in succession might make these two Heavenly Venerables truly believe someone was controlling them.

That would be interesting!

His mind filled with thoughts, Su Yu's eyes hardened, and he flew forward swiftly.

...

Boom!

Another loud explosion, and the Six-Winged was caught again. This time, Moon Heavenly Venerable and Demon Heavenly Venerable didn't hold back, breaking one of the Six-Winged's wings.

But seeing the Six-Winged about to self-destruct again, Moon Heavenly Venerable felt a murderous urge, gritting his teeth, then once more donned a divine smile, "Six-Winged, come back with me. We have no intention of killing you..."

"Get lost!"

The Six-Winged roared, breaking through the blockade and fleeing once more.

Mo Tianzun frowned deeply. "This won't work! The moment he faces a life-and-death crisis, he has a strong urge to self-destruct. Capturing him alive is nearly impossible. Killing him is easy, but as soon as there's a threat of death, he self-destructs. This is..."

He wanted to curse.

Dealing with Six Wings was not difficult for the two of them together. Even alone, they could suppress him, perhaps even subdue him. But they couldn't stop him from self-destructing, and that was the problem. Six Wings was far more valuable alive than dead.

Mo Tianzun and his companion continued their pursuit. Mo Tianzun spoke with a somber tone, "Is he being controlled? If someone is controlling him, making a quasi-king self-destruct at any moment, that's terrifying! The human heart is unpredictable. In the midst of a great war, the fear is that someone might be cowardly. But now, Six Wings seems like a puppet, yet he retains his intelligence and combat strength!"

Yue Tianzun took a deep breath. "Don't let the Immortal Race find out!"

They couldn't hide it from the Demon Race anymore, but the Immortal Race must not know. Otherwise, the Immortal Race, already adept at controlling minds, might discover something if Six Wings fell into their hands.

Mo Tianzun nodded but frowned. "What do we do now? Killing him is not a problem, but capturing him alive..."

"Wait for an opportunity. You break his physical body, and I'll instantly suppress his sea of will. Let's see if we can capture him alive."

"Alright!"

The two reached an agreement and continued their pursuit.

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu frowned as he continued to chase, pondering for a moment before suddenly asking, "Lantian, do you think there's still hope to kill them?"

"No."

Lantian gave a negative answer.

Su Yu remained silent for a while before asking, "Do you think we can make some deals with the Myriad Races?"

Lantian was taken aback. What did he mean?

Eyes appeared on the bamboo ring, looking at Su Yu. Su Yu squinted, "Didn't you say before that our enemy is now the Chaos Race? If we can kill the Myriad Races' Tianzun without sacrificing everyone, I'd be happy to do it! But if it costs us, and benefits the Control King's lineage, that's not my goal!"

"You want to cooperate with them?"

Lantian said solemnly, "What do we have to offer them? What leverage do we have?"

Su Yu squinted. "Pseudo Dao experts! The Myriad Races have many pseudo Dao experts, at least a third of them. There are at least five or six Tianwang, and dozens to nearly a hundred Daofuse. Do you think the Myriad Races are willing to give up such a powerful force?"

"You mean..."

"Marquis Bonewing and Six Wings gave us a chance to prove that we can use this to threaten the Myriad Races!"

"Negotiating with a tiger!"

Lantian provided the answer.

Su Yu nodded. It was indeed negotiating with a tiger, but so what? Nowadays, everything was a gamble. The Myriad Races had lost many strong experts, and honestly, Su Yu feared they couldn't fight against the Control King's lineage. That would be a big problem.

Since the Myriad Races already knew there was a third party... let them know!

Su Yu's expression changed several times as he looked into the distance, judging the direction those guys were heading. Quickly, he took out a spatial portal, intending to teleport ahead of them!

Lantian was startled. "You want to show yourself?"

Too dangerous!

There were two Tianzun!

He could guess some of Su Yu's thoughts. At this moment, Lantian quickly said, "I'll impersonate you..."

"Useless. Only I can suppress Six Wings!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "Don't worry. If they really attack, I can escape. You stay on the side to support me. It's best if you don't expose the spatial channel."

"Alright!"

Lantian could only support Su Yu's decision, secretly calculating how to quickly rescue Su Yu if he encountered a crisis.

...

The chase continued.

Yue Tianzun was getting frustrated, and so was Mo Tianzun. They couldn't kill, stop, or capture him. It was maddening!

Mo Tianzun gritted his teeth. "If it doesn't work, just kill him!"

Yue Tianzun hesitated but soon nodded grimly. "If there's really no other way, killing him is better than letting him escape!"

As they were thinking, a figure appeared on a mountain peak ahead of the fleeing Six Wings.

Who was the unlucky fool standing there?

Yue Tianzun still shouted, "Move aside! Ahead is the traitor Six Wings, run!"

It seemed to be a Daofuse!

If Six Wings killed him, it would be hard to explain to the God Race.

As Six Wings rapidly fled, he didn't even notice Su Yu, preparing to pass through and kill Su Yu with his wings!

But as Six Wings spread his wings and flew at incredible speed, Su Yu didn't dodge!

Behind him, Yue Tianzun wanted to curse. Fool!

Can you stop Six Wings?

If you die, you deserve it!

He was thinking this when suddenly, a divine aura erupted from Su Yu. In the next moment, Su Yu reached out towards Six Wings, a Starry Sky Seal hidden in his palm.

With a single seal, the power of the Great Dao was instantly severed, and Six Wings' connection to the Great Dao was cut off. His eyes changed slightly, suddenly becoming clear. What had he just done?

Before he could think further, Su Yu's massive hand pressed down, slamming Six Wings into the void. With a grasp, he held Six Wings in his palm.

Silence!

Yue Tianzun and Mo Tianzun's expressions changed drastically, stopping instantly, looking at Su Yu with grave expressions.

Who was this?

Six Wings was a quasi-king level expert. The two of them together could kill Six Wings, but to suppress him instantly...

The two seemed to realize something, both showing shock.

To suppress Six Wings instantly... impossible, especially since Six Wings' aura weakened instantly. There must be something wrong.

Su Yu, wearing a mask, spoke in a low voice, chuckling, "Two Tianzun, after such a hard chase, why not let me hand him over?"

With that, he tossed Six Wings, and in an instant, the power of the Great Dao reconnected.

At that moment, Six Wings went berserk, his eyes blood-red, about to self-destruct.

Mo Tianzun and Yue Tianzun retreated instantly, while Su Yu once again pressed down with a palm, the Starry Sky Seal suppressing, grabbing the self-destructing Six Wings, stepping into the air, and chuckling, "Don't the two Tianzun want him?"

Yue Tianzun's face changed slightly, his eyes cold. "You did this?"

At this moment, they vaguely understood!

Six Wings' problem was caused by this person!

At this moment, the suppressed Six Wings' eyes cleared, looking at Yue Tianzun with some sorrow, but helpless, unable to speak, a stark contrast to his previous madness!

Mo Tianzun was eager to move, but Su Yu sneered coldly, "Mo Tianzun, it's best not to move. Among you, aren't there many who have cultivated the pseudo Dao? Do you not care about their lives?"

With that, Su Yu laughed sinisterly, "Besides... even if you kill me, this isn't my true body. Why bother?"

At this moment, in the distance, figures identical to Su Yu appeared one after another.

Each had a sea of will, each had a physical body, and their auras were similar.

Each Su Yu wore a mask, each spoke in unison, "Two Tianzun, kill one of me, kill a hundred, but... what about a thousand, ten thousand?"

Mo Tianzun's willpower spread instantly, his face changing. They all seemed real, only differing in strength!

Which one was the true body?

The one before them was strong; was this the true body?

But in the distance, there seemed to be another with quasi-king strength!

All were Lantian!

Yes, at this moment, except for the first, the rest were all Lantian.

Confusing the senses!

Yet, Lantian's clones were extremely adept at disguise, and even without disguise, they were like true bodies, no different from the original.

At this moment, both their faces were somewhat unsightly.

They originally wanted to capture Su Yu, but now, they dared not act rashly!

Yue Tianzun said coldly, "Are you Human?"

"Zhou Tiandao of the Torchbearer lineage!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Greetings to the two Tianzun!"

"Torchbearer lineage!"

The two's expressions changed again. Mo Tianzun seemed to recall something, shouting, "Was it you who attacked the Sealed Mountain last time?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Yes, just a reminder. You were too foolish! All these years, you haven't discovered the Chaos Race! I'm very disappointed! Do you know, the Chaos Race has dozens of quasi-kings, five or six Tianzun, and two rulers of laws! I'm worried you'll die of stupidity, and no one will be able to resist them!"

"Nonsense!"

Mo Tianzun's purple hair flew, coldly saying, "This world can no longer birth rulers of laws!"

Su Yu sneered coldly, "Frogs in a well, ignorant! Do you not know the Chaos Dao? The Chaos Dao does not enter the myriad Daos! Back then, the Human Emperor sealed the myriad Daos, preventing the Myriad Races from mastering the power of laws, but he couldn't seal the Chaos Dao! Foolish beings, my Torchbearer lineage comes from the Human Emperor's legacy. Do you think we know less than you?"

The two's expressions changed, rulers of laws!

Could it be trusted?

Hard to say!

But at this moment, Yue Tianzun didn't dwell on this, coldly saying, "You've hidden well. Why reveal yourself now? Was it you who caused trouble with Marquis Bonewing and Six Wings?"

Su Yu said softly, "Enough, don't contact others, it's unnecessary! Since I dare to show myself, I'm not afraid of being captured. What use is it to capture one of my clones?"

Yue Tianzun frowned, "Friend, you've misunderstood!"

Su Yu laughed, "Whether it's a misunderstanding, you know best!"

"Then what do you want this time?"

At this moment, they were both eager to know some things.

And this person before them might tell them something.

Sure enough, Su Yu chuckled softly, "The Chaos Race comes from the Control King's lineage! The Control King betrayed back then, causing the Culture King, Time Sage, and Martial King to disappear one after another. Otherwise, would the Myriad Races dare to rebel? The Control King's lineage is the greatest sinner of the Human Race!"

With that, Su Yu said coldly, "Also, Mo Tian, I don't know if you're truly unaware or pretending, but the Control King's lineage is now actually a human-demon hybrid, part demon bloodline, part human bloodline!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable's heart trembled!

Mo Tianzun's face also changed dramatically, and he gritted his teeth, "Nonsense!"

He couldn't admit it!

Su Yu chuckled softly, "Nonsense?"

He smiled, and suddenly, from the void, he grabbed a person. The Extermination King turned pale, and Su Yu chuckled softly, "This person is a member of the Chaos Race we've spent a long time capturing! Of course, there was also Ziyan before, all from the same lineage..."

With that, he reached into the Extermination King's chest, pulled out a piece of flesh, and tossed it towards the two, his voice cold, "Is it the bloodline of the Control King? You can judge for yourselves!"

"Whether this bloodline is real or fake, you can determine for yourselves!"

"According to our investigation, it is the bloodline of the Control King and the Flame Demon Emperor!"

At this moment, both Moon Heavenly Venerable and Mo Tianzun grabbed some of the flesh and quickly delved into it. Soon, their expressions became peculiar.

Moon Heavenly Venerable's heart shook!

The Chaos Race, not only had the bloodline of the Control King but also that of the Demon Race!

This... this was terrifying!

The power of this bloodline was not fake, not a blend. As a Heavenly Venerable, he had enough judgment to know that it was a perfect fusion!

To fake it, unless a long time ago, the bloodlines of the Control King and the Flame Demon Emperor were mixed, and both sides eliminated the repulsion, it would be impossible!

Moon Heavenly Venerable's heart was in turmoil!

At this moment, he was both shocked and afraid.

Mo Tianzun gritted his teeth, "Are you trying to sow discord among us?"

Su Yu laughed lightly, "No, I trust the Demon Race! After all, the Control King's lineage doesn't even acknowledge the Human Race, let alone the Demon Race? Bloodline is just bloodline, it doesn't mean anything! I have no intention of sowing discord, it's childish and boring! Of course, if Mo Tianzun thinks the Chaos Race will treat you as one of their own... you can try taking the Demon Race to join them, see if they're the masters or if you are?"

Su Yu chuckled softly, "Does your Demon Race really think you can seize power from them? Do you think the Control King's lineage would agree?"

Mo Tianzun frowned slightly.

Moon Heavenly Venerable coldly asked, "What exactly do you mean?"

"Don't move!"

Su Yu frowned, "I said, capturing my avatar won't do anything, of course, this quasi-king avatar is extremely precious, I don't want to lose it for no reason!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable's heart trembled slightly, and the hand he was clenching gradually relaxed, "Don't misunderstand, friend!"

Su Yu smiled, "No misunderstanding! I appeared today just to remind you that your so-called Myriad Race Alliance... is too fragile!"

"Just like the Six Wings and that Bone Wing Marquis, easily toyed with by me!"

Su Yu laughed somewhat wildly, "Not just them, last time when I attacked Sealing Mountain and killed those quasi-kings, it was the same! Our lineage, as the inheritors of the Human Emperor, naturally can restrain them!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable frowned, "You mean, the Human Emperor's lineage can restrain them?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Torchbearer lineage, only we are the true Human Emperor's lineage. Those like Bingku and Danyu, who didn't listen to the lineage master and rashly went out to assist Hundred Battle... how foolish!"

"Their deaths caused great sorrow to the lineage master, but they're dead, so there's no point in discussing it further!"

Mo Tianzun was still pondering the matter of the Chaos lineage. Hearing them mention this, he said solemnly, "So last time, including this time, it was all your doing?"

Su Yu laughed, "Yes and no. The Underworld Race incident wasn't our doing, it was those guys trying to lure us out! Similarly, we did all this to lure them out! The Myriad Races, in this, are just a balance to our existence! You are strong, though foolish, but not weak in strength!"

"You've been fighting for so many years, including against Hundred Battle, it's all just a part of the Chaos Race's plan!"

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Our Torchbearer lineage cannot restrain them, cannot match them, so we took the risk, killed some people, to remind you that they are about to emerge! Releasing Hundred Battle was just to give them some pressure, that Moon Luo, playing Hundred Battle like a fool, just one Moon Luo is enough to give you a headache!"

The two's expressions grew increasingly heavy.

Moon Heavenly Venerable looked at the Six Wings he had captured, then at the Extermination King who had been taken away, took a deep breath, and said, "You appear now, are you looking to cooperate with us?"

Su Yu laughed, "Talking to smart people is easy!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable sneered, "Cooperate, do you have the capital? Where are the strong ones of your lineage? If you want to cooperate, come out and talk! Do you intend to use us as pawns?"

"Isn't that so?"

Su Yu laughed, "After so many years, do you really think you're not pawns? To be honest, you are just pawns in the game between us and the Chaos Race! Our pawns are the Human Race, the Control King's pawns are you... unfortunately, still a move short, we lost, Hundred Battle ruined everything for us!"

These words were hard to accept!

The two Heavenly Venerables looked extremely displeased.

Pawns!

According to this person, in the ten-thousand-year game, they and the Human Race were just pawns, only the Torchbearer lineage and the Chaos Race were the players for these ten thousand years!

However, from the current perspective, perhaps everything was true!

If so... ten thousand years of war was a joke!

Su Yu said with pity, "You know too little! You know nothing about us, nothing about the Chaos Race, nothing about the Dao Source Land being the Human Emperor's backup plan, all pseudo-dao experts are under our control! You know nothing, yet you dare let people cultivate pseudo-dao! Do you know why the Human Race never lets people cultivate pseudo-dao? Because, in every generation, we Torchbearers would inform them not to cultivate it!"

Su Yu chuckled softly, "You know too little! Like children, ignorant and clueless! You don't even know the Chaos Race can produce rulers of laws! Nor do you know, in this Myriad Realms, there are more than one or two rulers of laws! Just in the lower realm, there are quite a few!"

The two's pupils contracted, and Moon Heavenly Venerable said coldly, "Nonsense!"

Su Yu laughed, "Truly foolish! Do you think you can win? Laughable ants! In the lower realm, the Martial Emperor is still alive! Perhaps you don't even know who the Martial Emperor is, and the Martial Emperor has been suppressed! And he... is also in league with the Chaos Race!"

Su Yu said softly, "Don't you even know this? In the Death Realm, several rulers of laws are suppressed, do you not know this either? From beginning to end, this has been a war belonging to the Human Race, the Myriad Races... as I said, are just pawns!"

These words were unacceptable to the two Heavenly Venerables!

Mo Tianzun's purple hair flew, and he shouted coldly, "Pawns? Everything is just your one-sided story, what right do you have to control the Myriad Races? Who do you think you are!"

Unable to accept such a conclusion!

It was too hurtful!

A powerful aura blew Su Yu back, yet he still smiled, his laughter unyielding, "Don't get angry, as Heavenly Venerables, don't you have this bit of patience?"

Su Yu laughed, "Pawns can also turn the tables! In this Myriad Realms, who isn't a pawn? All are pawns of the Human Emperor, Control King, Immortal Emperor! You don't really think they're dead, do you?"

Su Yu laughed, "If so, I can only say, you... are too naive!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable frowned, "They're not dead?"

Su Yu laughed, "You... you really think they're dead?"

He laughed somewhat helplessly, "My goodness, you actually always thought they were dead! Are you joking? Of course, they're not dead! How could they be! They're all in the depths of the River of Time, still fighting to this day! Truly dead rulers of laws, there are very few!"

This series of explosive news kept shaking the hearts of the two.

Was what this Torchbearer lineage said true or false?

The Human Emperor and the others weren't dead!

There were still many rulers of laws in the Myriad Realms!

The Dao Source Land's paths were all under the control of the Human Emperor's lineage!

One piece of news after another exploded in their minds, leaving them dizzy!

If everything this person said was true, then... then what was the point of all these years of fighting, all these years of slaughter?

Everything was under someone else's control!

Su Yu seemed to know what they were thinking, and he laughed, "Fighting, of course, has meaning! Now, the strong of all sides are fighting, or rather, the strong of three sides, one is the Human Race, one is the Myriad Races, one is the Control King, the Control King... perhaps can be seen as the spokesperson for the Chaos Ancient Beasts!"

Su Yu said softly, "He betrayed the Human Race, yet unwilling to join the Myriad Races, formed his own race, allied with the strong among the Chaos Ancient Beasts, opened the Gate of Hell, and framed the Culture King and others..."

Su Yu sighed, "The Control King is our common enemy! Of course, the Human Race and the Myriad Races have no friendship to speak of, it's all mutual use!"

Saying this, Su Yu laughed, "I came today just to remind you, the Chaos Race is more troublesome than you think! Even if you defeat the Chaos Race, there are still ancient beasts behind them, many, even not lacking rulers of laws!"

"Now, only by joining forces is there a slim chance of survival! Otherwise, there's only a dead end!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable digested this information, suppressed his agitation, and said calmly, "Cooperate and join forces? We've been killing each other for so many years, how do we cooperate? How do we join forces? How do we trust each other?"

Su Yu laughed, "I didn't say to merge forces, you do your thing, I do mine, just... between you and me, we can have some cooperation, the target is the Chaos Race, between you and me, try to reduce consumption! To be honest, last time I killed 9 of your quasi-kings... I felt heartache, so many died, the Chaos Race probably laughed their heads off!"

As soon as these words came out, the two's auras surged, both carrying killing intent!

Mo Tianzun shouted coldly, "Don't think we won't kill you!"

"Go ahead and try!"

At this moment, the surroundings echoed with the laughter of a thousand Su Yus. "Go ahead, kill me. Our cooperation will end here! We are in the shadows, and the Chaos Race will target you first! If you think you can withstand them... feel free to try! Or, if you choose not to cooperate now, that's fine too. I'll wait for you to suffer a major setback before you come seeking us!"

Su Yu chuckled softly, "Believe me, if you attack Chaos Mountain, you're bound to suffer. Without a significant loss, you won't realize just how powerful they truly are—beyond your imagination!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable extended a hand to stop the enraged Mo Heavenly Venerable, speaking in a low voice, "So, the cooperation you propose... is it merely non-interference?"

"No, no, no!" Su Yu laughed. "As a first step in our cooperation, we can conduct some transactions."

"Transactions?" Moon Heavenly Venerable was taken aback, then laughed, "Are you joking? We sweep the Upper Realm to kill the Human Race, and you want us to hand over the humans we find to you, while you... only promise not to touch the pseudo-dao experts?"

Su Yu's smile faded, and he replied calmly, "Is it that funny? Not at all! Your sweep of the Upper Realm isn't just about killing the Human Race; it's also about consolidating the power of the myriad races, allowing the three races to control them! Killing humans... how many living humans are really left?"

Mo Heavenly Venerable's eyes flickered, seemingly communicating with Moon Heavenly Venerable. After a moment, Moon Heavenly Venerable said calmly, "You want to take the humans... that's not impossible. Hand over the method to release control over the pseudo-dao experts, and we can complete this transaction!"

Su Yu chuckled, "That... I can't do! Our control over the pseudo-dao experts isn't about control for control's sake. It's about inheriting some of the Human Emperor's power of laws. Controlling the pseudo-dao is just incidental! I can only promise that until the Chaos Race is destroyed, we won't touch them. Doing so would only aid the Chaos Race! Afterward... it's every man for himself! Of course, during this period, you can have these pseudo-dao experts find ways to switch paths... and cultivate their own Great Dao."

Su Yu laughed, "If it doesn't work out, just use them as disposable cannon fodder. If they die, they die. In a great battle, let them charge at the front to deplete the Chaos Race's strength. Do you think I would control them for the Chaos Race's benefit?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Of course, if you're unwilling to make this deal... then I'm sorry, but I'll have to make these pseudo-dao experts a thorn in your side, ready to turn against you at any moment!"

Both of them paled slightly.

Words alone were not enough!

However, the changes in Bone Wing Marquis and Six Wings were evident to them, shocking them to the core!

They had seen with their own eyes how Six Wings became frenzied, even disregarding self-destruction.

Moon Heavenly Venerable suppressed the urge to kill Su Yu, worried that killing him would be futile. Among these thousand avatars, which one was his true body, exuding a faint quasi-king aura?

It was impossible to determine!

He said in a deep voice, "So, you're saying that if we find strong humans, we hand them over to you, and you only guarantee not to tamper with the pseudo-dao experts until the Chaos Race is destroyed?"

Su Yu smiled, "Yes, and there's one more thing: your people must not target us. Otherwise... we will retaliate!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable probed, "And what about other forms of cooperation?"

Su Yu chuckled, "That's... not easy to disclose! But since we're talking about cooperation, I don't mind revealing some information! We have people within the Chaos lineage! At critical moments, they can deliver a fatal blow! Otherwise, how could we have captured Ziyan and others?"

Su Yu smiled broadly, "Gentlemen, I've said enough. If you're interested, you can try cooperating once! You can wait for my message. Next, my lineage plans to launch an attack on them... if you're interested, we can join forces briefly to see... so many quasi-kings of the myriad races have died, and we've lost some too. But the Chaos lineage hasn't suffered much. How about cooperating once to kill a few quasi-kings?"

The two exchanged a glance, and Mo Heavenly Venerable said coldly, "I and Moon Heavenly Venerable cannot make the decision, especially since the Immortal Race is not present, making it impossible to decide!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Immortal Race has many smart people who will weigh the options! If you agree, you can continue the sweep, find a few strong humans, and hand them over to me as a token of cooperation... if not, then forget it!"

"Hand them over to you, with only a simple promise?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable said coldly, "Isn't that asking too much?"

Su Yu laughed, "True, so how about this: you hand over the strong humans to us, and I'll give you some formation talismans that will prevent you from being repelled by the ancient beasts when entering Chaos Mountain! Otherwise, when you reach Chaos Mountain, the ancient beasts will be your greatest threat! The Chaos lineage and our lineage can enter Chaos Mountain without being targeted by the ancient beasts, but you... will have to fend for yourselves!"

At these words, the two's eyes lit up!

"Is this true?"

Su Yu laughed, "Of course, only we and the Chaos lineage know the Forbidden Heaven Formation! You saw how we sealed our auras before; we can do it, and so can they, but you... cannot! This means that when you enter Chaos Mountain, you won't be able to stay long. In the depths, there are ancient beasts, even Heavenly Venerables and rulers of laws!"

This time, their expressions changed.

Formation talismans, along with not touching the pseudo-dao experts, were the promises made by the Torchbearer lineage, and the requirement was simple: exchange for strong humans.

Mo Heavenly Venerable said in a deep voice, "What if we can't find strong humans?"

Su Yu laughed, "If you truly can't find them, then forget it. But if you kill them, I'll know. Among you... do you really think there are no spies from us or the Chaos Race? Not to mention, March is friendly with our Human Race, and you know this yourselves! Thunderstorm is the same. Don't you know that Hundred Battle has a marriage alliance with the Giant Race? You can't be unaware, right? Destiny, that fence-sitter, wouldn't mind selling us some information if you casually chat with him. As for others... I won't say more!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Including those pseudo-dao experts, it's too easy for me to get information!"

"Gentlemen, since I dare to make this request, naturally, I have confidence!"

"You'd better keep this confidential. The cooperation should only be known to a few Heavenly Venerables. Don't let it spread. If even the Daofuse Realm knows, then the Chaos lineage will know too!"

Awkward!

Uncomfortable!

That's how Moon Heavenly Venerable and Mo Heavenly Venerable felt. Everything seemed to be within someone else's calculations. Perhaps there had always been eyes watching their every move.

Now, their enemy was actually reminding them to keep it confidential!

It was too uncomfortable!

"How do we contact you..."

Su Yu laughed, "Simple, I have countless avatars. When you want to find me, just shout 'bold scoundrel' in a crowded place, and my avatar will naturally contact you!"

What kind of nonsense is this?

Their faces grew even darker!

Was he saying that their every move was truly under his surveillance?

Just shout in a crowded place, and that's it!

They were inclined not to believe it!

But... what if?

Moon Heavenly Venerable suppressed his anger and killing intent, looking at Six Wings, and said in a low voice, "Then can you release Six Wings?"

Su Yu laughed, "Of course, it's a small matter. Six Wings might be a fierce general in our upcoming battle against the Chaos Race, very fast. I like him, so why would I let him die!"

With that, Su Yu pointed a finger, and the power of the Great Dao spread, quickly contacting Six Wings' Great Dao power. Su Yu swiftly extracted the chaotic will within.

Moments later, he casually tossed Six Wings over to Moon Heavenly Venerable.

Moon Heavenly Venerable quickly stepped back, but at this moment, Six Wings did not go berserk. He tentatively connected with the Great Dao, and then Six Wings regained his Heavenly King aura. However, Six Wings was heartbroken, turning to Su Yu with gritted teeth, "Am I... destined to be controlled by you for life?"

Su Yu laughed, "You can switch paths, choose a true Great Dao. I'm not stopping you! But right now, we need combat power, so you'd better think it through! Did I force you to cultivate the pseudo-dao? Six Wings, I won't kill you; killing you is meaningless! It's just to show a few Heavenly Venerables that I... can control you anytime!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable was also secretly shocked.

This guy, he just released Six Wings' control, and he had easily controlled Six Wings before.

Six Wings was, after all, a quasi-king with considerable strength, and he released him just like that!

Su Yu chuckled, "If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave!"

With that, he laughed, "If you don't kill me, then I'll be on my way!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable and Mo Heavenly Venerable were itching to act, but they didn't know whether they should capture him. They looked at the surrounding avatars, all frowning.

At this moment, Su Yu snapped his fingers lightly.

In the next moment, a figure appeared, instantly transforming into a portal, and Marquis Tongtian's voice came through, filled with amusement, "Deputy Branch Master, where to? Tongtian is at your service!"

"Anywhere!"

"Understood!"

With a hum, Su Yu vanished from the spot.

All around, the numerous avatars disappeared in an instant.

In the distance, Lantian's quasi-king true body also vanished immediately.

Mo Heavenly Venerable wanted to pursue, but Moon Heavenly Venerable raised a hand to stop him, gritting his teeth, "Chase what? An avatar, what good will it do if you catch it? Marquis Tongtian! This guy... he's actually here!"

This Torchbearer lineage feels incredibly dangerous and mysterious to him at this moment.

He was on the verge of losing his mind. "Mo Tianzun, do you think... everything he said earlier, is it true or false?"

Mo Tianzun remained silent, unable to give a definitive answer. However, they both knew that everything was now beyond their control!

...

In the distance, Su Yu's back was drenched in sweat!

Scared me to death!

Fortunately, Lantian's avatar was effective, leaving these two Heavenly Venerables unable to determine whether he was an avatar or not.

After the initial shock, Su Yu quickly broke into a smile, a somewhat crazed smile.

Cooperation... isn't it a good thing?

Perhaps I can even receive some powerful human experts from the enemy's hands. Now that would be interesting. Even knowing it's aiding the enemy, Mo Tianzun and the others might have to grit their teeth and send them over!
