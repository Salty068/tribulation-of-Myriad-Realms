Chapter 713: The Iron Devourer Race of the Upper Realm

The Iron Devourer Race's domain was located near the southern region. The Divine Fire Mountain was also in close proximity to this area. In this region, there was also the Marquis of Southern Suppression, who was hidden within the Tian Cave Ridge. The southern part of the Upper Realm was a rather complex area. Here, the Iron Devourer Race, which was friendly to the Human Race, resided. Additionally, several human Daofuse cultivators were hidden here, and the remaining human experts liked to be active in the south.

The Iron Devourer Race was considered a strong race. Their domain in the Upper Realm wasn't a giant city but rather a massive mountain range known as Bamboo Mountain. The south was mountainous, and though the Iron Devourer Race wasn't numerous, they were scattered throughout Bamboo Mountain, living a carefree life.

...

A so-called domain was a place where a Daofuse cultivator resided. The power of laws of a Daofuse cultivator permeated part of the area, marking it as their territory. This was the domain. If an outsider, especially another Daofuse cultivator, trespassed without permission, it would be considered a hostile act.

At this moment, Su Yu and his group quickly made their way from Chaos Mountain. Along the way, they passed by the domains of several races, but Su Yu deliberately avoided them. With the Heaven Gate open, Su Yu had a significant advantage. He could sense whether there were Daofuse cultivators lying in ambush and where they were located. Although the various races had been quite active recently due to the near annihilation of the Dragon Race, Su Yu was confident that he could avoid unexpected encounters.

Bamboo Mountain was an enormous mountain range. As the name suggested, it was abundant with bamboo, and the source qi was quite dense. From afar, one could see some Iron Devourer Beasts frolicking and rolling around on Bamboo Mountain.

Jiuyue glanced at the scene, drooling a bit. "There are so many bamboos here. They look quite sturdy!"

He wanted to eat them!

Su Yu was exasperated. Why do they have such a hobby? Are bamboos really that delicious? Do they have a meaty aroma? You've eaten a ton of dragon meat, and you're still interested in these bamboos?

Ignoring Jiuyue, Su Yu activated his Heaven Gate, scanning the surroundings. His eyes flickered as he said, "The Daofuse cultivators of your race are all gathered deep within Bamboo Mountain. Are they worried about being ambushed?"

Previously, the Daofuse cultivators were scattered, but it seemed the Iron Devourer Race had sensed a threat.

After a moment, Su Yu raised an eyebrow. It wasn't three Daofuse cultivators, but four!

"Hmm?"

Su Yu looked deeper into the mountain, squinting his eyes as he spoke in a low voice, "There's an unfamiliar Daofuse cultivator among your race. Is it March or someone who advanced later?"

Upon closer inspection, something still felt off. It didn't seem right! Moreover, Su Yu didn't sense any Heaven King-level presence among the four Daofuse cultivators. Wasn't it said that Marquis Giant Bamboo had the combat strength of a Heaven King? Could it be that all four were from the Iron Devourer Race, with two having advanced later?

With some doubts, Su Yu glanced around, narrowing his eyes. "It seems there are spies near the Iron Devourer Race."

Lantian chuckled, "Yes, I've already noticed. The gods, demons, and immortals have all placed spies here, but they haven't entered Bamboo Mountain. It seems they're all keeping an eye on the Iron Devourer Race."

Of course, they had to keep an eye on them. This race wasn't weak.

Su Yu rubbed his chin and suddenly smiled, "Since there are people watching, we shouldn't make too much noise. I'm afraid if we trespass, the Iron Devourer Race won't be pleased. If a conflict arises, it won't be good."

"Jiuyue, you go!"

"Me?" Jiuyue said naively, "Go alone?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled, "No, I'll go with you!"

With that, Su Yu suddenly transformed, turning into an Iron Devourer Beast. Then, the Book of Time slightly fluctuated, emitting a wave belonging to the Iron Devourer Race. Following that, his physical body trembled slightly, and the Seventy-Two Castings technique was pushed to its limit.

Nowadays, Su Yu rarely impersonated others. However, that didn't mean he couldn't. The Book of Time contained a virtual dao belonging to the Iron Devourer Race, and Su Yu himself was proficient in the Iron Devourer Seventy-Two Castings. Now, with his increased control, he could slightly utilize the virtual dao without needing to activate it with blood essence.

In an instant, two Iron Devourer Beasts appeared on the spot. Jiuyue looked at Su Yu, and Su Yu looked back at him. The others turned their heads away. Watching these two stare at each other was amusing, but they had to hold it in.

Jiuyue looked at Su Yu, amazed, "You look so much alike!"

He could barely tell them apart.

Jiuyue glanced at him, saying naively, "Why don't you disguise yourself as October, Emperor Yu?"

"..."

Are you taking advantage of me?

Su Yu cursed inwardly. He didn't expect Jiuyue, with his thick eyebrows and big eyes, to be up to no good.

"No, I'm August!"

I'll be your father!

Jiuyue said naively, "That won't work. My father is over six thousand years old. He lived through the last tide."

Su Yu was speechless. "Then just consider me an ordinary Eternal from your race. I'm your guard, Big Bamboo."

"..."

Jiuyue wanted to laugh but held it in. He nodded, saying naively, "Alright, Big Bamboo!"

He changed his tune so quickly.

Su Yu and Jiuyue didn't delay any further. Soon, the two of them appeared and headed towards Bamboo Mountain from afar.

...

Nearby, some of the spies glanced at the two and didn't pay much attention. To them, all Iron Devourer Beasts looked the same. Coming and going was normal. They were only there to monitor the general movements of the Iron Devourer Race. If a truly powerful individual left, they might not even notice.

...

Inside Bamboo Mountain.

As soon as Su Yu and Jiuyue stepped in, they felt a faint power of laws permeating the area. The two exchanged glances and nodded slightly. The Daofuse cultivator covering this area might have already noticed them.

It was normal. Su Yu didn't have Jiuyue deliberately conceal or hide anything to avoid causing a commotion when they got closer.

...

At the same time.

Deep within Bamboo Mountain, inside a massive hall made of emerald green giant bamboo, three Daofuse cultivators of the Iron Devourer Race were conversing with a humanoid Daofuse cultivator. At this moment, one of the Iron Devourer Daofuse cultivators, who had been eating, suddenly looked up and gazed outside, his large eyes filled with confusion.

Did he sense it wrong?

No, right!

How did our race suddenly have another Daofuse cultivator?

It was indeed a Daofuse, right?

Blinking his large eyes, the eating Iron Devourer Beast looked outside again. The power of his dao fluctuated slightly, carrying a hint of peculiarity. Was it from our race?

Could someone be impersonating?

The aura felt unfamiliar!

Soon, his power of dao fluctuated, and the other two Iron Devourer Beasts in the hall, along with the humanoid Daofuse cultivator, all looked at him.

"May, what's wrong?"

The Iron Devourer Beast in the center asked. The outer area was May's domain, and April hadn't sensed anything.

May continued eating bamboo, speaking slowly as he chewed, "Nothing, you guys continue your conversation. I'm not interested. Carry on!"

Seeing him say this, April didn't press further and continued chatting with the humanoid Daofuse cultivator.

...

On the outskirts of Bamboo Mountain.

At this moment, Jiuyue was surrounded by some Iron Devourer Beasts. A chubby little Iron Devourer Beast rolled over, sniffed Jiuyue, and curiously asked, "Sir, why haven't I seen you before?"

Su Yu wasn't sure how these creatures distinguished each other. He could only think that perhaps it was similar to how humans could recognize each other. However, when looking at other races, without special markers, it was really hard to tell them apart, relying only on aura recognition.

"Just returned!"

"Oh!"

The little Iron Devourer Beast quickly rolled away. At this moment, the nearby power of laws grew slightly denser, approaching the two of them. It seemed to be probing them.

Meanwhile, Jiuyue continued eating, smiling naively, "We're family, don't look."

What are you looking at!

The power of laws fluctuated slightly, and a miniature Iron Devourer Beast appeared in the air, looking confused and puzzled.

It seemed... to be from the Iron Devourer Race.

Not an imposter!

Of course, the power of dao seemed a bit special, but the bloodline power was fine.

"Who are you?"

The miniature May asked with some peculiarity. If it were just an extra weakling, he wouldn't care. But an extra Daofuse, what was that about?

Jiuyue smiled naively, "Guess!"

He learned this from Su Yu!

May seemed a bit confused and quickly guessed, "Are you a child of Marquis Giant Bamboo born outside?"

He continued, shocked, "Marquis Giant Bamboo really had a little Giant Bamboo in the Dao Source Land, and you've already reached Daofuse?"

So fast!

This little Iron Devourer Beast didn't seem very old. He could only think this way.

Marquis Giant Bamboo wasn't currently in Bamboo Mountain but had gone to the Dao Source Land.

"Is it because of the Dragon Race incident that Marquis Giant Bamboo asked you to return?"

Jiuyue was stunned. Really? Was Marquis Giant Bamboo so flamboyant, having a little Giant Bamboo?

"Not telling you. Which month are you?"

Jiuyue was born late and didn't really know these few.

"May!"

Jiuyue decided not to say anything further. May was somewhat hostile towards humans. He only asked, "Is Senior April here?"

"Yes!"

Miniature May said, glancing at Su Yu beside Jiuyue, curiously asking, "Another smaller one. Did Marquis Giant Bamboo have two, or is it yours?"

Jiuyue wanted to laugh but quickly said, "He's called Big Bamboo. Let's meet and talk."

Big Bamboo!

Upon hearing this, May thought, Marquis Giant Bamboo's descendant, huh? Big Bamboo, Giant Bamboo, all in the same lineage! Just like their lineage, all named after months.

Could it be that Marquis Giant Bamboo intended to turn his lineage into Big Bamboo, Medium Bamboo, Small Bamboo, and Tiny Bamboo?

"Now?"

May hesitated, "It's best not to come now. It's inconvenient."

"Why?"

"A bothersome human has come, seeking an alliance with us. It's annoying. I don't want to deal with him, but April insists on meeting him. What can I do? He's my father, so I have to meet him here. It's so annoying to listen to."

Beside him, Su Yu's eyes flickered.

A human!

Shadow Marquis?

No, the dao he saw wasn't Shadow Marquis's. So, was it someone else?

Su Yu also asked, "Which human?"

"From Tian Cave Ridge."

May did not hide anything. These two seemed to be from his lineage; he could sense the bloodline aura and could tell that Su Yu had cultivated the Seventy-Two Castings, and it seemed he had achieved profound mastery, perhaps even completing the entire Seventy-Two Castings! This was something no outsider could impersonate. The Iron Devourer Race's Seventy-Two Castings were not something other races could master, and even if they could, they wouldn't reach such a profound level.

Su Yu's heart stirred. Tiankuling, Marquis Zhennan. He hadn't expected the Iron Devourer Race to have connections with Marquis Zhennan.

"Is Marquis Zhennan here?"

"No."

Su Yu was taken aback. If not, then who was the Daofuse expert he saw?

"It was General Wenqi under Marquis Zhennan. He succeeded in Daofuse a few years ago."

Su Yu understood. Luck was on their side. Achieving Daofuse wasn't about some people being unable to do it; it was about finding the right opportunity. When the opportunity was right, Daofuse would naturally follow. The intelligence from Marquis Dingjun's side was outdated, so some discrepancies were normal.

Su Yu spoke up, "Then let's go listen in!"

"You want to listen too?"

May didn't mind but muttered, "It's annoying, young ones. I want to leave. Humans, annoying!"

Su Yu noticed that although May said he disliked humans, he didn't chase away General Wenqi, which was somewhat reassuring. May wasn't very friendly towards humans, but he didn't seem extremely hostile either.

Su Yu and Jiuyue didn't say much more and quickly headed deeper in. Su Yu also wanted to hear what General Wenqi had to say and observe the Iron Devourer Race's reaction. General Wenqi's timing for visiting the Iron Devourer Race seemed well-chosen, quite appropriate.

...

Inside the Great Bamboo Hall.

May's power of the Great Dao was constantly fluctuating. April glanced at him several times, tapping the table, "May, you're neglecting the guests!"

What are you doing? Since the humans are here, show some respect.

General Wenqi, hearing this, said softly, "It's alright. Dao Master May can do as he pleases. This time, I also bring Marquis Zhennan's apologies. During the outbreak of war back then, the humans didn't take good care, leading to the fall of Dao Master May's descendants. Marquis Zhennan has always deeply regretted this..."

May couldn't be bothered to respond.

During the third tide, his descendants fell, which led to June's rise today. Otherwise, the Iron Devourer Race's lineage would still be theirs. Of course, the current June was his grandnephew, so it was all the same.

Many millennia had passed, and May couldn't be bothered to discuss these matters anymore. However, since this person spoke to him, May replied, "It's not the first time. Didn't July also get tormented to death? This tide, I don't know if it's August going to die or September and October... Anyway, you don't care."

General Wenqi sighed, "Regarding the last tide, Marquis Zhennan and I deeply regret it. If we had known Prince July would personally go to battle, we would have ensured his safety no matter what..."

May sneered, not bothering to respond.

Saying these things now, what's the use?

As they spoke, April was slightly startled, looking at May. May also sensed the arrival of the two and said, "The descendants of Marquis Juzhu have returned, coming back from the Land of Dao Source."

"Descendants of Marquis Juzhu?"

April was stunned. Marquis Juzhu had offspring in the Land of Dao Source?

How come I didn't know!

Upon careful sensing, it did seem like the Iron Devourer bloodline. He was puzzled and quickly frowned, looking at May. Are you sure they're descendants of Marquis Juzhu?

Don't get it wrong!

Beside them, General Wenqi was also moved, saying softly, "The descendants of Senior Marquis Juzhu have returned?"

"And Marquis Juzhu..."

April explained, "Marquis Juzhu probably can't return in the short term. The situation in the Land of Dao Source is complex now, with several unclaimed rule-based Great Daos appearing recently, and all parties are vying for them."

As they spoke, Su Yu and Jiuyue entered the hall.

Upon entering, April's expression changed slightly, looking at Jiuyue. Jiuyue grinned foolishly, noticing April seemed more vigilant than May, and said with a silly smile, "Greetings, Senior April, Senior May."

As he spoke, a token appeared in his paw, flashing briefly.

April's heart shook violently!

The Iron Devourer Token!

What the hell!

Isn't this thing supposed to be in the lower realm?

Held by June!

At this moment, April was utterly bewildered. What the hell, where did this guy come from? Clearly not a descendant of Marquis Juzhu, yet holding the Iron Devourer Token from the lower realm, and at the Daofuse Realm, with the same bloodline...

For a moment, he was in a daze.

Jiuyue grinned foolishly, "Senior April, I just heard Senior May mention that humans have arrived. Can we listen in too?"

April, filled with countless doubts, thought for a moment and nodded, "You can sit on the side, don't run around, and don't interrupt."

"Alright!"

Jiuyue chuckled, quickly walking over to May's side.

At this moment, there were four Daofuse experts in the hall.

April, May, General Wenqi, and another Daofuse from the Iron Devourer Race, who seemed to have recently advanced.

Seeing Jiuyue looking at him, the Iron Devourer also grinned foolishly, "Yuan Yue!"

Jiuyue was taken aback, "A female?"

It turned out to be a female Iron Devourer, and at the Daofuse Realm, how rare!

Originally heading towards May, Jiuyue suddenly changed direction, heading towards Yuan Yue, asking as he walked, "Yuan Yue, how old are you?"

"The giant bamboo has grown nine segments."

"Oh, oh... that's alright."

Nine thousand years old, meaning slightly older than himself, but still within an acceptable range.

He quickly sat down beside Yuan Yue, while Su Yu... felt like cursing.

What is this guy doing?

Is there any difference between a female Iron Devourer and the rest of you?

Aren't they all the same?

Above, April and May also looked at Jiuyue with some peculiarity. This newcomer, arriving and immediately trying to hook up with our best-looking and strongest Yuan Yue?

Too much!

While they were thinking, General Wenqi, after observing for a moment, smiled, "Since the descendants of Marquis Juzhu are here, Dao Master April, may I repeat what I said earlier?"

"Go ahead."

April was now more concerned about where these two came from. The lower realm?

Can people come up from the lower realm now?

Strange!

General Wenqi looked at Jiuyue and Su Yu, smiling, "The situation is like this. You two should be aware of the changes in the Dragon Race! This matter was led by our Human Race's Marquis Dingjun, with some hidden experts of the Human Race revealing themselves this time."

General Wenqi smiled, "Now, the Blood Dragon Marquis of the Dragon Race has been killed. Although the Human Race's strength hasn't returned to its peak, it has regained some counterattack capability! And the Hundred Battle King will soon be unsealed... So, Marquis Zhennan hopes to form a Human Race alliance now."

"The Iron Devourer Race has always been our best ally. Marquis Zhennan hopes to reach an agreement with the Iron Devourer Race..."

Su Yu listened for a while and understood the gist.

They were here to recruit allies!

From the sound of it, there might even be some persuasion involved.

Su Yu quickly grasped the key point and, without hesitation, asked directly, "We've heard about this! Marquis Juzhu also values it greatly. This time, we came back to gather information. From what the general said, were the experts who attacked the Dragon Race all from the Human Race?"

"Yes."

General Wenqi smiled, "All from the Human Race."

"Oh, can you tell us where these people came from?"

Su Yu smiled, "Why was there no movement before?"

"Previously, several seniors were in seclusion in various dangerous places. After the fall of Marquis Minshan, Marquis Zhennan contacted some hidden seniors from various places, and they all chose to come out. Originally, they were going to come out to unseal the Hundred Battle King, but the situation is tense now, so they had to appear early..."

Su Yu smiled, "As far as I know, there are quasi-kings among them. Quasi-kings are all old seniors. Can you reveal who this quasi-king senior is? Could it be an ancient Human Marquis? Otherwise, it's impossible for a quasi-king expert to appear out of nowhere..."

General Wenqi smiled, "There is naturally a quasi-king. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to kill the Blood Dragon Marquis. The name of this quasi-king senior... is not easy to say. Mainly, we are worried about the information leaking. If the myriad races find out the identity of the quasi-king, they might set up specific traps."

Su Yu smiled, "We're about to form an alliance. Can't you even reveal a name? Then... we wouldn't dare to rashly ally with you. How can we ally with someone we know nothing about?"

General Wenqi raised an eyebrow slightly, glancing at Su Yu, then at April.

April was also a bit peculiar. Previously, he had just listened and hadn't really spoken. Now, seeing this newcomer continuously asking questions, he found it strange. When did our descendants become so inquisitive?

Despite the oddity, he nodded, "This..."

Su Yu spoke up, "My name is Big Bamboo!"

Alright!

"Big Bamboo makes a good point, General Wenqi. Can you tell us about this quasi-king of the Human Race? Maybe I know them."

General Wenqi's expression remained unchanged, as if he were contemplating. After a while, he sighed, "Alright then! The senior who emerged from our Human Race this time is the ancient Marquis Wen'an."

"Marquis Wen'an?"

April said solemnly, "Marquis Wen'an, wasn't it said that he had fallen?"

"Just hidden, not fallen..."

General Wenqi explained briefly.

Su Yu had mostly understood by now and didn't think much of it. Marquis Zhennan's side urgently needed to recruit a batch of allies, and a bit of persuasion was normal.

However, if the persuasion was so exaggerated that even the people were fake, once exposed, it wouldn't be a good thing.

Persuasion must have some truth to it.

Yet, this guy's words contained not a single truth. Su Yu smiled and asked again, "So, Marquis Zhennan wants to form an alliance. After the alliance, what does the Iron Devourer Race need to do?"

General Wenqi breathed a sigh of relief, finally not dwelling on those issues. He quickly said, "Isn't Lord Juzhu in the Land of Dao Source? Recently, the myriad races have been making some moves, possibly gathering to discuss targeting Marquis Dingjun and others. The Land of Dao Source might even send out some experts."

"Marquis Zhennan's intention is to unite and locate the sealed place of the Hundred Battle King, and first rescue him! Once the Hundred Battle King is free, all problems will cease to be problems!" Wen Qi exclaimed excitedly. "The Hundred Battle King is immensely powerful, nearly reaching the realm of a ruler of laws. Even three or four quasi-kings can't match him and might even be killed by him!"

A single quasi-king, even one like the East Heavenly King, could handle five or six Daofuse cultivators. In other words, the Hundred Battle King could face twenty to thirty Daofuse cultivators alone. His strength was indeed formidable!

Marquis Zhennan was actually planning to unseal the Hundred Battle King. No wonder he came to seek the Iron Devourer Race at this time. The Iron Devourer Race's Marquis Giant Bamboo had the combat strength of a Heavenly King and was in the Dao Source Land, and March might still be alive. Marquis Dingjun knew this, and so did Marquis Zhennan.

If they could win over the Iron Devourer Race and unseal the Hundred Battle King, there was indeed hope to resist the myriad races.

Wen Qi quickly added, "Marquis Dingjun and the others will help us hold back the myriad races and attract more of their experts. As long as the Iron Devourer Race is willing to help unseal the Hundred Battle King, the Human Race will have a great opportunity!"

He spoke with anticipation.

Su Yu watched him for a moment before speaking again, "Unseal the Hundred Battle King? After all these years, if it could be done, the Human Race would have done it already. Although the Iron Devourer Race has a quasi-king, the Dao Source Land is extremely dangerous... isn't it difficult?"

Wen Qi hurriedly replied, "It might have been difficult before, but now, the opportunity is right in front of us! The Dragon Race has encountered such a major incident, and their experts in the Dao Source Land will surely return immediately. Without the Dragon Race, each race will withdraw some experts... The small races still need to protect themselves, so in the Dao Source Land, only the three major races have the strength left..."

Wen Qi urgently continued, "As long as the Hundred Battle King is freed, the Iron Devourer Race will become the Human Race's staunchest ally. If the Human Race can once again unify the Myriad Realms, the Iron Devourer Race will be elevated above the myriad races, second only to the Human Race!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment and asked, "How many people will your Human Race send to act with us?"

Wen Qi's expression changed slightly, hesitating for a moment before quickly saying, "I, Marquis Zhennan, and we will try to notify a few others to act together. We won't let the Iron Devourer Race bear too much pressure..."

He added, "Of course, even if other Human Race members don't go, they will create chaos for the myriad races in various places!"

"Will that Human Race quasi-king really act with us?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu squinted and said, "If they can't act in concert with us here, and if they fail to entangle the myriad races' experts, unsealing the Hundred Battle King will cause a big commotion. If the experts of various races return, we'll be in trouble!"

"Rest assured!" Wen Qi quickly assured, "They will definitely support us!"

Nonsense! Support your grandpa. They just want to trick us first. Once we really go to the Dao Source Land to unseal, and the myriad races return to aid, it will be too late to regret. We can only hope to unseal the Hundred Battle King.

The idea is not bad.

Su Yu smiled, "How about this, we can't fully trust your guarantee. Why don't you have Marquis Wen'an come to the Iron Devourer Race personally for a discussion?"

General Wen Qi hurriedly said, "Marquis Wen'an is currently being watched by the myriad races and cannot act rashly. If he comes to the Iron Devourer Race, it might bring great disaster to the Iron Devourer Race!"

"That's true!"

At this moment, Su Yu seemed to have become the spokesperson for the Iron Devourer Race.

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "In that case, it's fine if no one comes from that side. You, Marquis Zhennan, Marquis Huoyun, Marquis Yunshui, Marquis Shadow, and General Yingwu, at least three of you must come. Only then will we dare to act. Otherwise, if it's just Marquis Zhennan's idea... wouldn't that harm our race?"

General Wen Qi's face changed several times, and soon, he gritted his teeth and said, "Alright! I will try my best to contact the other lords and ensure the Iron Devourer Race is satisfied!"

Su Yu smiled, "Then let's talk when they arrive!"

Wen Qi looked at April, who smiled and said, "Let's do as the Big Bamboo says! Our race is not unwilling to help the Human Race, but while helping the Human Race, we must also ensure the safety of our race's experts and the survival of our race! Unsealing the Hundred Battle King is not that simple. Relying solely on General Wen Qi as a spokesperson... our race cannot fully trust."

General Wen Qi was helpless. The negotiations had been going smoothly before. But now, with the arrival of this descendant of Marquis Giant Bamboo, things were not going as smoothly.

Forget it!

He could only say, "Then I will take my leave first. I will visit again next time with more sincerity than this time!"

Su Yu smiled and said nothing.

Seeing General Wen Qi rise to leave, Su Yu finally smiled at the bamboo he was holding in his paw, "Go capture him, keep it low-key, don't make a fuss, lest these guys ruin my plans!"

He had initially planned to ignore these people. But if they really went to unseal the Hundred Battle King... damn it, would the battle at Chaos Mountain be disrupted by them?

Damn it!

They add chaos without fear but can't fight. Unsealing the Hundred Battle King will surely make the myriad races temporarily set aside their conflicts. The myriad races won't let the Hundred Battle King escape. At that time, they might have to withdraw Heavenly Kings to the Dao Source Land to guard, which might weaken the forces against Chaos Mountain.

This was not something Su Yu wanted to see.

The big bamboo in his hand was a clone of Lantian.

As for Wen Qi, Su Yu didn't care whether he was good or bad. Unsealing the Hundred Battle King was also a predetermined strategy of the Upper Realm Human Race. As for deceiving the Iron Devourer Race... they were already at a dead end, and deceiving allies was not their first time.

But in Su Yu's eyes, do your thing, just don't mess up mine.

If you mess up my plans, I'll have to deal with you!

April, May, and even Full Moon were slightly stunned. Who was he talking to? Who was he capturing?

They instantly looked at September and Su Yu. April said in a deep voice, "Little Daoist, why do you have the Iron Devourer Token?"

September was chatting with Full Moon. Hearing this, he chuckled foolishly, "April Ancestor, I am the current Iron Devourer Beast Emperor, so naturally, I have the Iron Devourer Token."

April was stunned.

September scratched his head and chuckled, "June Ancestor passed the position of Beast Emperor to me. I am September, so now... I should be the Beast Emperor, right?"

He chuckled, "Does the Beast Emperor from the Lower Realm have any authority in the Upper Realm?"

At this moment, May's mouth was agape, and he said foolishly, "You... aren't you the descendant of Marquis Giant Bamboo?"

Full Moon also looked at September in surprise.

September chuckled, "No, I never said that. It was May Ancestor who assumed it. I am the descendant of June Ancestor!"

"You came from the Lower Realm?"

"Yes!"

September stood up, bowed to the two ancestors, and said honestly, "I came from the Lower Realm. I've been in the Upper Realm for a while now. The Dragon Race incident was our doing!"

April and May were both shocked!

"And Wen Qi..."

"He's just a big liar!"

September chuckled, "The Bright Moon Flower Valley and Dragon Race incidents were all our doing. I even devoured eight Dragon Cities in one go, consuming nearly a million dragons..."

As he spoke, he opened his mouth, burped, and a small dragon appeared. In the next moment, he bit it off with a crunch, burping and laughing, "There are still many I haven't digested. I'll eat them slowly. April and May Ancestors, do you want some? They can be eaten for a long time!"

"..."

The Iron Devourer Race's Daofuse cultivators were all stunned.

The Dragon Race was devoured by September!

And he ate over a million!

We?

April's eyes flickered as he looked at Su Yu, then at September, and said in a deep voice, "How did you come up? And who came up with you?"

"I came up through another passage, with the Human Emperor from the Lower Realm..."

Before they could speak, September laughed, "Our race has already allied with the Human Race in the Lower Realm. Our race, the Space Ancient Beast Race, the Hou Race, and the Fate Clan have all allied with the Human Race, exterminating the Daofuse cultivators of various races in the Lower Realm, forcing the God, Demon, and Immortal Races to seal their realms!"

September quickly said, "I also advanced to Daofuse with the help of Emperor Yu! I inherited the Devouring Great Dao from February Ancestor!"

"This time, we came from the Lower Realm to the Upper Realm, first exterminating two Daofuse cultivators from the Demon Race and six from the Dragon Race, just to test the waters of the Upper Realm!"

Although September was foolish at this time, he spoke quickly and laughed, "Before I came up, June Ancestor told me to listen to the opinions of the ancestors in the Upper Realm! I also brought some gifts for the ancestors. I was afraid that ordinary gifts wouldn't be appreciated by the ancestors, so I devoured a million dragons to offer to the ancestors to eat together. They taste quite good!"

April and May, the three Iron Devourer Beasts, all stared wide-eyed at him.

The shocking upheaval of exterminating the Dragon Race was not done by some hidden Human Race, but by people from the Lower Realm!

Their own race's September was actually involved!

"You..."

April said in shock, "Where did the Lower Realm get a quasi-king?"

September chuckled, "This was born from the tide, a war general under Emperor Yu! This time, only one came. There are more in the Lower Realm! Emperor Yu has already conquered the Realms of Life and Death, killed the East Heavenly King and West Heavenly King, subdued the South Heavenly King, and expelled the North Heavenly King... To avoid alarming the Upper Realm, they haven't exterminated the three major strong races yet. Otherwise, the Myriad Realms would have been unified long ago!"

Listening as if hearing a heavenly book, April was somewhat dazed!

But May suddenly shouted, "You say Wen Qi is a liar, are you... are you also deceiving us?"

The Human Race is full of cunning.

Although this guy in front of them was of their own race, May was very annoyed. This guy had just deceived them!

September chuckled, "I'm not lying. Everything I said is true! I am now the Beast Emperor of the Iron Devourer Race in the Lower Realm. Why would I deceive the ancestors!"

September said honestly, "If you don't believe me, I can call those people over. This time, we came to the Upper Realm to do something big. The Myriad Realms, only the Upper Realm hasn't been taken yet!"

The hall was extremely quiet at this moment.

April's expression changed unpredictably, and he said in a deep voice, "In the Lower Realm, you participated in the war?"

"Yes!"

"The lesson of the past is right before us. The allied races that helped the Hundred Battle King in the last tide were all exterminated..."

September shook his head. "It's different. This Emperor Yu of the tide is incredibly wise! Since our race joined the battle, we've suffered almost no losses. Instead, I've advanced to the Daofuse Realm. Various races have flocked to him, including those like Hongmeng Guardians. Even the Hou Race is eager to join. During Emperor Yu's Skysoar period, thirty-six Guardians protected his path. He suppressed the myriad races' Daofuse experts and the Hundred Battle forces, unifying the Human Realm and redefining the rivers and mountains. Unlike the previous tide, he had no elders to support him..."

September quickly continued, "Emperor Yu is different from Hundred Battle. The myriad races that have allied with him have all benefited, without any drawbacks! He unified the realms of life and death, and none of the allied Daofuse experts have fallen! Instead, they have slain dozens of powerful Daofuse enemies..."

Beside him, Su Yu listened silently.

I can't shake the feeling that this guy is deliberately flattering me, but I have no proof. Whatever, I'll just listen.

September remained excited and enthusiastic. "Yes, our current strength is still no match for the upper realm's various races, but this time, the upper realm has at most one-third of its forces here. If the entire upper realm were present, we could still contend with the major strong races!"

"As for Hundred Battle... Emperor Yu's stance is to ignore him. If he dares to block our path, we will kill him!"

September eagerly added, "Esteemed ancestors, this is a new era. The lower realm is now in the first year of the New Yu Era. It's no longer the ancient times; the dynasty has changed!"

"......"

April appeared somewhat bewildered. Has the lower realm changed so much?

May was also shaken and quickly asked, "Then what is Emperor Yu's strength?"

September chuckled. "Top-tier Daofuse!"

"Only top-tier Daofuse?" May was taken aback and couldn't help but curse, "Nonsense, not even a quasi-king?"

September grinned foolishly. "Emperor Yu is still young. According to the human calculation, he's only 22 years old, yet he already commands several with quasi-king combat strength!"

Upon hearing this, May was stunned again. "22 years old?"

He asked suspiciously, "22 tidal years?"

"No, just 22 human years!" September chuckled. "That's about the time it takes for us to take a nap, yes, just that long!"

September was incredibly earnest. "Emperor Yu is extraordinarily gifted and treats all races kindly. He reached the Skysoar Realm at 19, Daofuse at 21, and entered top-tier Daofuse at 22. I believe he will soon become a quasi-king... perhaps in just a few days!"

At this moment, the three powerful members of the Iron Devourer Race felt like they were listening to a fairy tale.

It's too ridiculous!

Is September deceiving us?

But... they quickly calmed down. April looked at Su Yu, "Is he... a strong member of our race?"

It feels like he is, yet also not.

September chuckled. "Sort of... let's not talk about the big bamboo for now."

September smiled. "This time, I'm here to seek the opinions of the esteemed ancestors."

"To join forces with us?"

April asked solemnly, "Is that what you mean?"

"No."

September replied with a silly grin, "I'm here to ask if the esteemed ancestors want to lead the Iron Devourer Race to migrate to the lower realm. The upper realm is dangerous now, and a great war will soon break out. Our intention is to migrate the Iron Devourer Race to the lower realm and confront the upper realm, using the boundary as the limit!"

Migrating the race to the lower realm!

April's heart trembled again. Instead of helping them kill, April said solemnly, "This matter is of great importance, and I cannot make a decision. Moreover... I don't know if your words are true or false! Although you hold the Iron Devourer Token, I will quickly notify Marquis Giant Bamboo to return!"

"Alright!"

September grinned foolishly. "Then let's leave it at that for now. We won't leave in the next few days. The esteemed ancestor should quickly notify Marquis Giant Bamboo to return. As for Wen Qi and Marquis Zhennan, don't bother with them! The Hundred Battle faction is full of reckless people, not worth engaging with!"

"......"

Such words.

April was somewhat amused and exasperated.

"Is that Emperor Yu's attitude as well?"

"Of course!"

September laughed. "Hundred Battle is just a big pit. Emperor Yu's stance is that even if he emerges, he's just attracting the myriad races' hatred. Don't mind him; it's a new dynasty now!"

April's eyes flickered with changing emotions and quickly said, "Then I will notify Marquis Giant Bamboo to return as soon as possible!"

Compared to dealing with General Wen Qi just now, this was much more important!
