Chapter 729: A Reunion with the Martial Emperor

Luminous Domain Mansion. 

Eighth Floor.

The world trembled.

Su Yu emerged from the ninth floor, and a massive convergence of the power of laws gathered above the council chamber. He had been here once before and knew the dangers present, as the power of laws loomed ominously overhead.

Ninety-nine shadows manifested, with a colossal human figure suppressing the myriad realms. As Su Yu descended from the ninth floor, the ninety-nine beams of light suddenly shot toward him.

"How dare you!"

A low voice resonated, not from Su Yu, but from the shadow suppressing the council. It wasn't a real person; everything here was merely a projection of the power of laws.

The gigantic human shadow suppressed the ninety-nine beams of light. Su Yu glanced around, observing the embodiment of human will on one side and the myriad races' will on the other. Without much thought, he casually tossed out two seals.

One was his Human Lord Seal, and the other was the Luminous Domain Seal. As the two seals merged into the human will's shadow, its aura surged. Previously, it had been retreating under the assault of the ninety-nine beams, but now it grew significantly stronger, quickly suppressing the beams.

This was a battle of wills and a contest of fortune. In the past, Su Yu wouldn't have been able to change anything. But today, with his own strength greatly enhanced and the human race's fortune gathered, he had obtained the Luminous Domain Seal, causing the fortune of the myriad races to be subtly suppressed.

Rumbling sounds echoed continuously.

Su Yu glanced at it but did not intervene. He looked down at the council chamber below.

"Where is Marquis Tongtian? Come see me immediately!" Su Yu's voice reverberated.

Moments later, a portal appeared in the void, quickly transforming into an old man. Marquis Tongtian, with a dazed expression, rushed over excitedly, "Your Majesty, Emperor Yu, is it really you?"

His excitement seemed genuine, not feigned.

I was scared to death! I feared someone else had arrived. The ninth floor had been noisy, and I was terrified that the Human Emperor had been defeated and the strong of the myriad races had returned. That would have been too terrifying!

Marquis Tongtian quickly approached, scanning the crowd, and joyfully exclaimed, "Marquis Dingjun, Shadow Marquis, Marquis Huoyun, Marquis Yunshui, General Yingwu... you're all here!"

After speaking, he glanced at the Great Zhou King, hesitated for a moment, and then joyfully asked, "Your Majesty, did you go to the Upper Realm and raid the old relics of the human race? Did you win, Your Majesty?"

Su Yu found him talkative and didn't bother to argue. He glanced at the ongoing struggle among the hundred shadows, then looked down at Marquis Tongtian, "How has the Martial Emperor been lately?"

"That bastard keeps bullying me!" Marquis Tongtian immediately complained, "He has partially unsealed himself and condensed a powerful will avatar, stronger than me! I can only guard the eighth floor now. That bastard even wants me to teleport him up... but I haven't betrayed Emperor Yu!"

Marquis Tongtian quickly added, "I've firmly refused him, and he even wants to kill me. Your Majesty, he's powerful, even as an avatar, much stronger than me... Can you handle him, Your Majesty? If not, I can teleport you to the underground floor and shave his head!"

At this moment, the other ancient marquises couldn't help but look at Marquis Tongtian.

He's still alive? And still as talkative as ever!

So many have died, yet this guy remains. Indeed, those who should die don't, while those who shouldn't have perished.

Marquis Tongtian suddenly looked at them, his eyes flickering, "Are you cursing me?"

"......"

The others ignored him.

"Your Majesty, they're cursing me!" Marquis Tongtian exclaimed excitedly, "They used to speak ill of me, jealous of the Culture King's favor. When I greeted them, they ignored me!"

General Yingwu couldn't help but retort, "Marquis Tongtian, when did you ever receive the Culture King's favor?"

"My title was bestowed by the Culture King himself. Who in the myriad realms doesn't know that?" Marquis Tongtian retorted indignantly, "Is there any doubt about that?"

The others were speechless. It seemed to be true. But this Marquis Tongtian... there was always something off about him.

Su Yu didn't bother to say much, glancing at Marquis Tongtian with slight surprise, "How did you reach the third-tier Daofuse Realm? You were only around the fourth tier before. Have you improved recently?"

Marquis Tongtian chuckled, "Your Majesty, you may not know, but I used to suppress the violent power of laws on the eighth floor. Recently, the violence has lessened, and the power of laws shows signs of dissipating. Last time, many people fused their Daos here, dispersing some of the power of laws."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "That's not bad."

He continued with a smile, "If things go smoothly this time and we quell all the violent power of laws on the eighth floor, you can leave!"

Marquis Tongtian's face stiffened slightly, and Su Yu chuckled, "Are you happy?"

Marquis Tongtian forced a smile, nodding, "Happy!"

Su Yu said softly, "As long as you're happy!"

He understood Marquis Tongtian's thoughts. The outside world was dangerous. Guarding the gate here was much more pleasant!

However, Su Yu didn't let him idle, saying calmly, "If you don't leave, once the Martial Emperor breaks free, he'll kill you first as a sacrifice!"

Marquis Tongtian's face froze, and he nodded, "Makes sense. He's been bothering me a lot lately. Thank you, Emperor Yu!"

This time, he didn't argue.

Because he felt it was indeed dangerous. Perhaps he had talked too much with the Martial Emperor recently, and the Martial Emperor was getting impatient, his attitude worsening.

Marquis Tongtian thought that maybe running away wasn't a bad idea!

"The Martial Emperor?"

At this moment, the other ancient marquises were somewhat surprised. They hadn't paid much attention when the Martial Emperor was mentioned earlier, but now they were quite surprised. What Martial Emperor?

Beside them, Lantian chuckled, "You don't know? How pitiful! The first to seventh floors of the Luminous Domain Mansion were all forged from the Martial Emperor's body. The Martial Emperor is still alive, and you didn't know? Didn't I tell you?"

The expressions of several people changed, but they remained silent.

Marquis Yunshui also ignored him, looking at Su Yu and speaking softly, "Emperor Yu, the Martial Emperor... is he the one suppressed by the Martial King at the end of the ancient era?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "That's him."

The group exchanged glances, unsure whether to feel joy or sorrow. General Yingwu, however, was excited, "Then he's the master of rules? Alive... doesn't that mean..."

Su Yu replied calmly, "Don't overthink it. The Martial Emperor hates the Martial King and his ilk to death. I'm fine, but you remnants of the ancient era... he'd probably want to kill you on sight! The Martial King and Culture King turned his body into a mansion, and his backside was used to plant flowers. The location of King Gong's Mansion isn't a good place... If it were you, how would you feel?"

"......"

Their faces changed.

General Yingwu's expression was strange, "Emperor Yu, do you mean... he's upside down?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Isn't it thrilling?"

"......"

Speechless.

No words could describe it!

General Yingwu thought for a moment and said, "Stay away from him!"

There's nothing more to say.

Truly thrilling!

If I were the Martial Emperor, I'd probably kill them on sight too. No wonder Su Yu said not to count on him.

Shadow Marquis sighed, "The Martial Emperor... he might be the only master of rules left! Stronger than ordinary masters of rules. If he were willing to help the human race, then..."

Then the human race would be formidable!

With a true master of rules, what would the Heavenly Sovereigns of the Upper Realm be?

Of course, if several Heavenly Sovereigns joined forces, even a master of rules might not win, as those guys have reached that level. But it also depends on the master of rules. The Martial Emperor is much stronger than ordinary Dao experts.

Su Yu didn't care much, saying casually, "As long as he doesn't cause trouble, that's the best outcome. If he does... then he's an enemy, and we'll have to find a way to deal with him!"

The group's expressions changed again. Dealing with him? That... would be as hard as ascending to the heavens!

Su Yu didn't continue the topic, looking around and then at the struggling power of laws. He smiled, "When the opportunity is right, Great Ming King, go to the Radiant King's Mansion. That's your ancestor's territory. You might find some unexpected gains!"

He had visited the Culture King's Residence last time, but there were still two rooms unopened, one for the Ink Path and one for the Paper Path.

"Lantian, go to the Paper Path room in the Culture King's Residence and see if you can open it. If not, then forget it. We'll go back with the Hunting Heaven List later."

The Hunting Heaven List was still with Liu Hong, but he could find an opportunity to take the benefits from the Ink Path and Paper Path.

"As for the Martial King's side..."

Su Yu thought for a moment. The Martial King's Mansion, these strongholds, might not be easy to enter.

He knew a descendant of the Martial King, Zhou Hao, who was still fighting in the myriad realms.

"Don't worry about the Martial King's Mansion for now!"

"The Control King's Mansion probably doesn't have anything good either!"

"Marquis Huoyun, go to your respective mansions and take what's yours. Everyone else, search the other mansions and take anything useful!"

Finally, Su Yu looked toward the council chamber.

Who knows if there are treasures inside?

On second thought... a meeting place probably doesn't have many treasures.

But those mansions should have plenty.

While the power of laws was still entangled, Su Yu smiled, "Go on, don't just stand here. If there are good things, take them! Leaving them here is a waste."

"Understood!"

These people were actually quite excited.

Marquis Huoyun and the others hadn't returned in countless years.

Even when the Luminous Domain Mansion opened while they were in the lower realm, they rarely entered because the eighth floor was quite dangerous, and Marquis Tongtian wouldn't let some people in before.

Su Yu looked at the sky, then at the Great Zhou King who hadn't left, and smiled, "Great Zhou King, keep an eye on the Human Lord Seal and the Luminous Domain Seal, suppress the power of laws here, and let everyone search for treasures. I'll go see the Martial Emperor."

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Emperor Yu, should I go with you..."

He was worried about an accident.

"No need. He won't fight me now. He's not fully unsealed yet and is worried about a mutual destruction with me."

Seeing Su Yu's insistence, the Great Zhou King didn't persuade further.

Su Yu actually wanted to see how far the Martial Emperor had unsealed himself.

To assess when he might break free.

Chapter 1: The Martial Emperor's Inquiry

In the depths of the Celestial River of Death, the Spirit Suppression Generals stood guard, their eyes fixed on the horizon. Suddenly, the air shimmered, and a familiar figure descended from the sky.

The Martial Emperor's expression shifted as he recognized the newcomer. It was Su Yu.

This young man had progressed at an astonishing pace. In just a few days, his mastery over the pen dao had reached an impressive level.

"Martial Emperor, it's been a while!" Su Yu greeted with a smile.

The Martial Emperor remained silent. It hadn't been long since their last encounter, during which Su Yu had caught him off guard with a powerful strike, leaving him no chance to speak.

In just a year, Su Yu had grown from struggling to defeat a ninth-stage Sunmoon Realm expert to possessing strength comparable to a quasi-king.

Back then, Su Yu had boldly declared that even if the Martial Emperor were to break free, he wouldn't be afraid. The Martial Emperor had dismissed it as mere bravado. But now, seeing Su Yu again, he couldn't help but feel a weight in his heart. Would he truly be unable to match this young man once he broke free?

"Su Yu!" the Martial Emperor called out, his gaze intense. "Did you come down from the ninth level?"

Su Yu chuckled. "Indeed."

With a wave of his hand, a table and two chairs appeared. "Care for some tea? Let's sit and chat."

Su Yu's smile was gentle. "Martial Emperor, you don't intend to break ties with me now, do you? Of course, I don't have time to deal with you at the moment."

The Martial Emperor's face darkened. "Even if we break ties, what can you do? Can you kill me?"

Su Yu laughed. "Who knows? Even if I can't kill you, it won't be pleasant for you, right? Come on, Martial Emperor, let's have a chat. My people are collecting some things above. Once they're done, I'll leave and won't bother you further."

With a snort, the Martial Emperor stepped into the air and sat down on one of the chairs.

Su Yu, still smiling, quickly took his seat and glanced at the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, who immediately understood and hurried over to brew tea.

Su Yu turned back to the Martial Emperor, his smile softening. "Martial Emperor, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"

The Martial Emperor stared at him coldly, saying nothing.

Su Yu continued, "I'll ask you some questions, and you can ask me some in return."

The Martial Emperor sneered. "What you know is of no interest to me!"

Su Yu chuckled. "Really? Don't you want to know where the Human Emperor and the others went? Or where the Martial King is? Aren't you curious about the current state of the Myriad Realms and its powerful figures?"

Taking a sip of the freshly brewed tea, Su Yu smiled. "Martial Emperor, you're out of touch! In these hundreds of thousands of years, how much information have you received? There's bound to be something you don't know, right?"

The Martial Emperor remained silent for a moment before coldly replying, "You have a point. Ask your question, and I'll ask mine. Answer truthfully!"

Su Yu laughed. "You don't trust me?"

The Martial Emperor said nothing.

Unbothered, Su Yu asked, "In the Primordial Era, there were many powerful figures. The Culture King and others were considered late Primordial Era powerhouses. What defines the Primordial Era?"

The Martial Emperor frowned. "Are you asking about its origin?"

Su Yu nodded.

The Martial Emperor thought for a moment before answering, "The Primordial Era, as you call it, is essentially the era we lived in. It was a time of chaos and competition among the myriad races. If you're asking about its origin or what event marked its beginning, it might be the emergence of the Death Realm."

He wasn't entirely sure but explained, "We didn't experience that period. There are two perspectives: from the Human Race's viewpoint, it began with the Human Ancestor leading the rise of the Human Race. From the myriad races' perspective, it started with the appearance of the Death Realm."

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "So, you're saying the Human Ancestor and the master of the Death Path were contemporaries?"

The Martial Emperor nodded slightly.

Su Yu wanted to ask more, but the Martial Emperor interjected coldly, "I've answered. Now it's my turn!"

Su Yu sighed. "Go ahead."

"Where is Taishan?"

Su Yu laughed, having anticipated this question. "The Martial King, Culture King, and Time Sage are likely together. I don't know their exact location..."

The Martial Emperor's face turned icy.

Su Yu continued calmly, "Don't be angry. It's not important where they are. What's important is that they're all engaged in battle and facing formidable foes. The Martial King might even be dead! A few years ago, the Time Sage was struggling. Do you know the Time Sage?"

"I don't," the Martial Emperor denied flatly.

Su Yu smiled. "She's the Culture King's sister, an unparalleled powerhouse. In my opinion, you're not even worthy to carry her shoes."

The Martial Emperor's face darkened.

Su Yu laughed. "Why look at me like that? I'm just being honest. In my eyes, the Time Sage is on par with the ancient Human Emperor and the Four Kings. From my perspective, only the Human Emperor can compare. Do you think you're stronger than the Four Kings?"

The Martial Emperor frowned. "Are you serious? Why have I never heard of the Culture King's sister?"

"You're ignorant, that's why."

Su Yu smiled. "I'm just telling you what I know. The three of them are likely together, and it's probable that the Time Sage discovered some danger, likely related to the River of Time. She roams the River of Time and has vast knowledge. Perhaps she discovered something, leading to their current crisis, prompting the Culture King and Martial King to rescue her."

After finishing, Su Yu asked, "How's that for information? Three unparalleled powerhouses are trapped, possibly even dead. What do you think you can do if you find them?"

The Martial Emperor was momentarily stunned.

In Su Yu's account, the Martial King seemed the weakest, and he claimed the Time Sage was even stronger than the Culture King. Now, he said all three were in danger, possibly dead.

Even if he knew their location, what could he do?

While the Martial Emperor was lost in thought, Su Yu asked, "Was there an era before the Primordial Era?"

"The Era of Creation," the Martial Emperor replied, regaining some clarity. "According to your terms, the Myriad Realms' history includes the Era of Creation, the Primordial Era, the Ancient Era, and the present. During the Era of Creation, there were no Myriad Realms. Everyone lived on the desolate ancient land, where ancient beasts reigned supreme, and the myriad races struggled. In the Primordial Era, the myriad races rose, quelled the ancient beasts' chaos, and established the Myriad Realms. In the Ancient Era, the Human Emperor unified the heavens, completing the unification of the Myriad Realms."

Su Yu nodded and asked, "Then..."

"It's my turn!" the Martial Emperor interrupted eagerly. "Where are the Human Emperor and the others?"

Su Yu was speechless. Didn't you say you weren't interested?

He quickly replied, "In the River of Time, probably upstream. You've opened the Heaven Gate, so you should know the situation. Going against the current, the flow of time is different from ours. They might feel they've only fought for a few hundred years, while for us, it could be a hundred thousand years. Of course, it could be the opposite, feeling like they've fought for hundreds of thousands of years... But I suspect they might be returning soon."

"Hmm?" The Martial Emperor was taken aback. "Returning?"

Su Yu replied calmly, "Eventually, they'll catch up to this era. The Myriad Realms have exhausted their hidden cards and foundations. It's time for them to make their entrance."

Su Yu smiled. "Maybe in three years, maybe five, maybe ten... Who knows? They might be returning soon."

The Martial Emperor took a deep breath. "You don't know the exact time?"

"Of course not. If I did, I'd delay it by three to five years."

Su Yu laughed and asked, "In your memory, are there any powerhouses capable of threatening the Culture King and the others? Also, was the Human Ancestor a practitioner of the physical dao? Where is the Human Ancestor? You mentioned the Death Path was incomplete. Where is its master?"

The Martial Emperor frowned at him. "Is that one question?"

Do you really think I'm that foolish?

Su Yu laughed. "Answer first. You might not know much, and you can ask me more questions later."

The Martial Emperor frowned but answered, "The Human Ancestor should be the pioneer of the physical dao. Thanks to him, the Human Race quickly grew strong, with many top-tier powerhouses emerging, giving them time and opportunity to forge their own paths. As for the master of the Death Path, I've said before, there are only legends about him from that era, with little introduction or records. Whether he's dead or missing, I don't know. As for powerhouses capable of threatening the Culture King and the others..."

He pondered for a moment. "In my memory, there shouldn't be any. Unless several masters of laws join forces, or the Immortal Emperor and Demon Emperor fight to the death, they might be able to deal with them. But in a one-on-one fight, those guys might not even be able to handle Taishan!"

Su Yu frowned. No one?

Then what did the Culture King and the others encounter?

Su Yu exhaled, and the Martial Emperor, not waiting for him to recover, hurriedly asked, "Tell me about the current situation. Are there any masters of laws among the myriad races?"

Su Yu smiled. "The current situation... I don't know about the myriad races. There are some top-tier Daofuse experts, but I haven't heard of any masters of laws."

"Daofuse?"

"Yes, top-tier Daofuse experts have the realm and comprehension of a master of laws but haven't mastered a dao."

The Martial Emperor seemed thoughtful.

Su Yu continued, "But this time, I went up for a bit. It's quite interesting up there. Do you know the Control King?"

Of course!

Su Yu chuckled. "That lineage is fascinating! They've established another race up there, with countless powerhouses. I suspect there's a master of laws among them."

The Martial Emperor said solemnly, "Wasn't it said that advancement was impossible? Were they left behind?"

"No."

Su Yu shook his head. "I'm talking about those with combat power comparable to a master of laws. Do you understand?"

"Those who follow the physical dao?"

Martial Emperor naturally understood, and Su Yu smiled, "It's not the path of the physical body; it's the path of chaos! We orthodox cultivators can't step into the realm of the rulers of laws because the Human Emperor has tampered with the Great Dao! But the Human Emperor can't tamper with the path of chaos. The Control King's lineage lives in chaotic regions, following the same path as ancient beasts—the path of chaos! This way, they might avoid those restrictions and reach the combat power of a ruler of laws!"

"The path of chaos?"

Martial Emperor, being a genius who had opened the Heaven Gate, had seen much. He frowned and said, "What you say isn't impossible! If one specializes in the path of chaos, with strong talent, they might hope to rival the Human Kings of the physical body path after tens of thousands of years!"

Not counting the rulers of laws, they would be like those Human Kings of the physical body path from back then!

Su Yu chuckled, "Interested in going up there to play with them?"

Martial Emperor glanced at him, sneering, "You want to use me as a weapon?"

Dream on!

Su Yu laughed, "Don't be so agitated. Two tigers can't share one mountain! The Control King's lineage wants to unify the Myriad Realms now. Let me ask you, if this world only has two rulers of laws, one on their side and one being you, would they not deal with you?"

"That depends on their abilities!"

Martial Emperor arrogantly declared, "Even among the rulers of laws, I am not a weakling!"

Su Yu smiled, "Are you sure they only have one?"

Martial Emperor sneered again, "If they had two or three, would you still have a chance to survive? Even if there is one, at most, it's just one. Otherwise, they would have wiped you out long ago! Su Yu, don't take me for a fool!"

"There's some truth to that."

Su Yu laughed, "But perhaps their lineage has quite a few quasi-kings. If they gather a dozen or twenty like me, plus a hundred Daofuse Realm cultivators, do you think you can match them?"

"How could that be..."

Su Yu interrupted, "It's very possible!"

Su Yu smiled faintly, "The myriad races have developed for so many years, with constant wars. This time, I went up and killed nine quasi-kings, and many are still alive! I probably didn't even kill half of them. Even if the myriad races have twenty quasi-kings, the Control King's lineage won't have fewer!"

Martial Emperor fell silent.

Su Yu was trying to provoke him!

He would not fall for it!

Su Yu wanted to use him as a weapon to kill people, but that was wishful thinking!

Seeing Martial Emperor remain silent, Su Yu didn't mind and continued smiling, "Alright, I'll ask one last question. Martial Emperor, do you know what the Gate of Hell is?"

"The Gate of Hell?"

Martial Emperor's expression shifted slightly as he looked at Su Yu. After a while, he said, "Who told you about it?"

"The Control King once went to guard it. I'm just asking."

Martial Emperor said solemnly, "The Gate of Hell... I've heard of it, but I've never been there! The Gate of Hell, as the name implies, is the gateway to hell! Or rather... the boundary between chaos and the Myriad Realms!"

He explained, "After the opening of the heavens, chaos and the Myriad Realms were distinguished, but there was a critical point where the power of chaos was eroding the Myriad Realms. Legend has it that to solve this problem and prevent the power of chaos from eroding the Myriad Realms, the opener of the heavens forged the Gate of Hell to block the chaos erosion... Of course, that's one version. The second version is that at the beginning of the ancient times, the myriad races rose, ancient beasts rampaged, and a group of ancient powerhouses drove the ancient beasts out of the Myriad Realms and forged the Gate of Hell to prevent the ancient beasts from re-entering the Myriad Realms!"

"The reason it's called the Gate of Hell is that whether it's to resist the power of chaos or the ancient beasts, any powerhouse stepping out of this gate would face danger and the threat of death!"

This guy really knew a bit.

Su Yu noted this down. Two legends, as Martial Emperor said, were both very dangerous.

Back then, the Control King guarded this place and was reportedly heavily injured. Perhaps he fought with ancient beasts there, so behind the gate was the world of ancient beasts, or simply a land of pure chaos?

Having learned this, Su Yu had nothing more to ask.

No need!

Martial Emperor, however, was eager, "Then I'll ask you one last question. How much of the pen dao have you mastered?"

"......"

Su Yu smiled, "That's personal privacy!"

Martial Emperor sneered, "You said it yourself, speak without reserve!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Martial Emperor knows how to seize an opportunity. Fine, there's nothing to hide, a little over eighty percent!"

Martial Emperor quickly calculated and said quietly, "How long do you think it will take you to master the pen dao?"

Su Yu smiled, "That's not within the scope of my answers, is it? I didn't even ask you."

Martial Emperor frowned, thought for a moment, and said, "If you answer me, I'll tell you a secret!"

"A secret?"

Su Yu laughed, "Not interested."

Martial Emperor looked at him, somewhat annoyed!

You asked me, and I answered.

I ask you, and you're not interested!

He gritted his teeth, "Don't be so quick to refuse. I know a place where a divine weapon is hidden..."

"Oh!"

Su Yu responded perfunctorily, nodding, "A good place. Martial Emperor should keep it for himself. Once unsealed, Martial Emperor can go out and take the divine weapon to strengthen his power!"

"......"

Damn it!

Martial Emperor cursed inwardly. A divine weapon, and you don't care?

Arrogant fellow!

Seeing his anger, Su Yu found it amusing and said, "Alright, Martial Emperor, help me with something, and I'll tell you."

"Impossible!"

Martial Emperor snorted, thinking Su Yu wanted to use him as a weapon.

Dream on!

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry and slowly said, "It's nothing major, just a small matter. I want to take Marquis Tongtian away. Once he leaves, the entrance from the seventh to the eighth layer will be cut off. Next time I come here, it won't be convenient unless I pass through Martial Emperor's body every time..."

Martial Emperor looked at him coldly, "What do you mean?"

Su Yu continued, "I have an idea. I plan to borrow a path. Martial Emperor, open a special passage within your body, allowing Marquis Tongtian's portal power to penetrate from the first to the seventh layer. This way, I can take Marquis Tongtian away and teleport directly to the eighth layer anytime without passing through the first to the seventh layers."

"Impossible!"

Martial Emperor was furious, "You want to open a path within my body?"

Su Yu said coldly, "It's just a small matter. Does Martial Emperor want me to pass through the first to the seventh layer every time? Do you want to meet me every time to be happy? As long as you lift the restriction and let Marquis Tongtian's power penetrate directly from the outside to the eighth layer, I will naturally enter the eighth layer directly next time, without passing through your body!"

"Either open a path yourself, or I'll pass through your body every time. Martial Emperor, think about it!"

Martial Emperor felt aggrieved!

He didn't want either of these options.

But as Su Yu said, if he didn't agree, Su Yu would teleport in every time and pass through his body each time.

After a long time, Martial Emperor gritted his teeth, "Fine, I can open a passage for him. In the future, if you come, you are not allowed to pass through my acupoints!"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course! It's time-saving and labor-saving. Why would I bother passing through Martial Emperor's body? This is a mutually beneficial matter!"

Su Yu was in a good mood!

This way, with Marquis Tongtian's power penetrating, he had hope of connecting the Death Realm, the Myriad Realms, and the Upper Realm.

Of course, Marquis Tongtian was a bit weak.

Su Yu looked at Marquis Tongtian, "If you have no power restrictions from the first to the seventh layer, can you teleport from the Myriad Realms to the eighth layer?"

Marquis Tongtian nodded, "Yes."

"What about the Death Realm?"

Marquis Tongtian grinned, "It's a bit difficult, but Martial Emperor's body connects to the Death Realm. Passing through his body as a transit is hopeful."

Su Yu exhaled, "What about the Upper Realm?"

"Can't!"

Marquis Tongtian shook his head directly, "Martial Emperor's body doesn't penetrate the Upper Realm. Unless you pull his leg up and try to pierce the Upper Realm, but it's very difficult!"

Marquis Tongtian didn't look at Martial Emperor's cold and terrifying face and continued, "Martial Emperor's legs were broken and drooped down. Find a way to stand him up and pierce the Upper Realm barrier, then there's hope to connect the three realms directly! Otherwise, it's not possible..."

Martial Emperor looked at him coldly, saying in a chilling tone, "Are you courting death?"

"......"

Marquis Tongtian shrugged, "I'm just telling the truth."

Really.

Why can't people handle the truth?

Forget it, I won't say anymore!

Su Yu, however, laughed and nodded, "I understand. Anyway, if I take you out, maybe there will be more means in the future, which is not bad! You have to work hard and become stronger. You are a spirit born from a portal. If you become powerful, in this world, any barriers or defenses are jokes. You can open a door anywhere!"

A spirit born from a portal actually had great potential.

Su Yu thought of many things and finally smiled, "If you can become a ruler of laws, setting up a door might intercept the River of Time!"

Marquis Tongtian wanted to retort, "How do you know?"

You're not me!

Alright, after thinking about it, forget it.

This one is not to be trifled with.

If I argue too much, and he gets upset and breaks me, what then?

He chose to remain silent.

And Su Yu, looking at Martial Emperor, smiled lightly, "You asked me when I could master the pen dao. That's hard to say. If everything goes smoothly, maybe... when the lower realm opens, I'll have mastered it! If not, then it's hard to say! It might be around the same time you get unsealed."

Su Yu laughed, "By then, Martial Emperor can spar with me, play around, maybe the pen dao isn't as good as Martial Emperor!"

Martial Emperor took a deep breath, cursing inwardly.

I don't believe it!

Alright, maybe a little.

But, I'm not convinced!

He wasn't convinced!

He had cultivated for countless years to become a ruler of laws, so why could Su Yu do it so quickly?

He sneered, "I hope so! That would be more interesting! Also, the path of the Myriad Realms has issues now. Didn't you say you can't become a ruler of laws?"

"I naturally have a way to solve it!"

Su Yu wasn't too concerned about this. He stood up, and the tables and chairs disappeared, even the chair under Martial Emperor's butt disappeared, making Martial Emperor's face look unpleasant.

This guy, he turns his face faster than flipping a book!

Even I can't turn my face as fast as him!

"Martial Emperor, open a path. Marquis Tongtian, go up and pick someone up. Don't stay here too long; it smells a bit..."

Su Yu turned and left, Martial Emperor's face was ashen, looking coldly at Su Yu, "Don't provoke me again!"

What is this place?

The butt!

Su Yu was clearly making a veiled insult—no, it was a direct provocation.

Turning back, he grinned, "No provocation intended, Martial Emperor. Don't misunderstand. There's no need to provoke you. I'm just speaking the truth! Of course, there's a bit of provocation in there too..."

The Martial Emperor glared at him coldly.

Su Yu calmly continued, "I've been pondering whether I should seize the opportunity to kill the Martial Emperor. But I'm worried that if you reconcile with me, I won't have a reason to kill you. Without killing the Martial Emperor, one of my myriad paths might remain incomplete... So, let's continue being enemies! Please, don't make peace with me!"

At that moment, the Martial Emperor felt like spitting blood. He was on the verge of madness, shouting angrily, "In your dreams! Su Yu, if I break free, I will kill you!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Good, that's what I want to hear! Lately, I've been worried that you powerful humans might reconcile with me, which would make it difficult to perfect my path... The more you oppose me, the more at ease I am when I kill. I'm a soft-hearted person!"

The Martial Emperor was seething with rage! Su Yu's words were pure mockery.

Yet, Su Yu wasn't mocking at all. He was genuinely contemplating how to perfect his human path. As for himself, he wasn't walking the human path. Whether it was Hundred Battle or the Martial Emperor, they shouldn't reconcile with him. It wasn't necessary.

I'm serious! What I say is genuine. I am indeed soft-hearted. If these two suddenly became desperate to become my followers, I wouldn't be able to strike. Being soft-hearted is a fault. If I don't eliminate you to perfect the human path, should I eliminate Lantian and Old Wan instead? That wouldn't be appropriate!

The Control King's lineage too—it's best if they don't suddenly switch sides. It's unnecessary. Just eliminate them all, and I'll be one step closer to perfecting my power of laws.

As these thoughts surfaced in Su Yu's mind, he waved his hand and vanished from the seventh level.

Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor's face was ashen! This bastard Su Yu was so arrogant. Did he really think I became the master of rules for nothing?

"We'll see!" the Martial Emperor snorted coldly. Would this emperor fear a mere youngster?
