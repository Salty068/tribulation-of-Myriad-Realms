Chapter 679: Fierce Battle (Requesting Subscriptions)

In the distance, Su Yu paid little attention to the matters involving the Daofuse Realm. Whether it was Xia Chen or not, it didn't matter. At this stage, a single Daofuse cultivator couldn't stir up much trouble. In the Death Realm, Su Yu felt more confident than in the realm of the living.

At this moment, Su Yu was observing a powerful being before him. He didn't recognize or know this entity, likely just awakened. Su Yu pondered whether this being was intelligent or not. If it was foolish, there might be some advantages to exploit.

This was a formidable opponent, perhaps slightly weaker than a Heavenly King, but not by much. Initially, it had fought Old Turtle to a standstill. However, it was now being suppressed. With the combined efforts of the South Heavenly King and Old Turtle, suppressing a Cangshan Ming was manageable.

At this moment, Cangshan Ming roared continuously. Damn it! Why was this happening? Why did the North King flee? Where did the humans get so many powerful experts? Even though the Great Qin King and others were retreating, the guardians and the marquises under the South King were incredibly strong. More and more revived necromancer marquises were being killed or captured.

"What is your name?" Su Yu asked.

Cangshan Ming, who was resisting two formidable enemies, angrily replied, "I am Cangshan Ming. What do you want, youngster?"

Cangshan Ming! Su Yu didn't recognize the name. However, Old Turtle did and was somewhat surprised. "Cangshan Ming? The Lord of the Cangshan of the Ming Race, close to the master of laws. Why are you so weak?"

"Weak?" Cangshan Ming was momentarily speechless. Yes, weaker than when he was alive. But... did they not consider who he was facing now? Damn! One was an old turtle, the other a South Heavenly King. Were they not top-tier experts? Was he really that weak?

Feeling aggrieved, he thought about how he had previously fought four or five marquises alone at the river's bottom. Su Yu seemed to notice his lack of intelligence and smiled, "Do you want to live or die?"

"What do you mean? Are you trying to humiliate me?" Cangshan Ming roared.

Su Yu chuckled, "No, I'm giving you a chance to live! See the 27 Eternals behind me? I'll choose a place. If you can defeat them, you can live. If not... then you die! Of course, since you're a necromancer of the Heavenly King level, I'll impose some restrictions. You'll fight in a place where you can't draw on death energy. If you're willing... you have a chance to survive!"

Cangshan Ming snorted. He didn't believe it! He quickly dived into the riverbed, attempting to escape. At this moment, Su Yu's forehead revealed the Heaven Gate once more. In an instant, the Heaven Gate opened, and a beam of light illuminated the Celestial River of Death, even penetrating the riverbed to reveal Cangshan Ming's presence.

Old Turtle instantly transformed into his true form, and with a thunderous crash, suppressed the river. Turtles were naturally adept at water battles. Cangshan Ming's attempt to escape by diving into the riverbed was futile with Su Yu revealing his true form, Old Turtle pursuing him underwater, and the South Heavenly King suppressing him from above.

Moments later, Cangshan Ming was battered and bruised. After a while, unable to endure any longer, he emerged from the riverbed, looking around. At this moment, more and more experts were gathering in this direction. With the Great Qin King and others leaving, the revived necromancers were dwindling. Previously, over a dozen necromancer marquises had been killed, and the remaining ones either severed their connection to the power of the great path and hid deep in the riverbed or were directly captured.

Some necromancer marquises decisively chose to abandon using the power of the great path and submerged themselves in the riverbed. This had its pros and cons. The advantage was that they couldn't be found easily. The disadvantage was that if discovered, reconnecting to the great path would take a moment, and in that moment, they only had the power of the Sunmoon Realm. If a strong opponent seized the opportunity, even a Daofuse or Eternal could be instantly killed.

Cangshan Ming looked despondent. Why was it like this? The North King had betrayed him! Bastard! He recalled Su Yu's earlier proposal and shouted, "If I defeat them, can I really live?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course! You can take a gamble! If you don't believe me, you'll soon be killed. But if you do, and you win, the chance of survival is high!"

After speaking, Su Yu looked at the guardians behind him and took a deep breath, "He's strong, even if he's injured now! Logically, you all combined should be equivalent to nine Daofuse cultivators. Nine Daofuse cultivators could kill him... but that's not how it works! If a few of you are killed, you might collapse!"

Su Yu looked at them, "Everyone, are you willing to engage in a life-and-death battle with him? If not, let the Spirit Suppression Generals kill him!"

At this moment, Cangshan Ming also looked eager. Facing 27 Eternals, although they were strong, the gap between the ninth stage of the Eternal Realm and his level was too vast. They couldn't really be considered equivalent to nine Daofuse cultivators. These people were not much different from those who had just stepped into the Daofuse Realm. Being able to resist didn't mean they could truly withstand him.

At this moment, he was also frustrated. He could only take a gamble! This was his first appearance. He thought he was overwhelmingly powerful and had hopes of dominating the Death Realm. Who would have thought that he would be on the verge of death as soon as he emerged?

At this time, Old Turtle also turned to look at the crowd. He understood Su Yu's intention! Personally battling a Heavenly King, these people would be fighting across several levels, and the rewards would be substantial. It might even allow seven or eight, or even more, to advance to the Daofuse Realm!

Capturing monarchs or necromancer marquises was one thing, but everyone contributed, and it was considered an easy gain. Killing them didn't offer as many rewards. That was the case before! Killing seventy or eighty monarchs only allowed 21 invincibles to advance to the ninth stage. They were already at the seventh or eighth stage, so the rewards were really minimal.

Naturally, there were risks. At this moment, Earthquake Guardian said solemnly, "We can't always fight easy battles! Since the Human Lord has created such a good opportunity for us, we want to experience the power of a Heavenly King!"

Take the battle to the Luminous Domain Mansion! 27 against one! Cut off his death energy supply. In such a situation, it's already an excellent battle configuration. If we can't kill this guy together, 27 guardians, all of whom are of the Weapon Fusion Method type, would seem too insignificant.

"Are you willing?"

"Willing!" Mountain Rise laughed, "Human Lord, with such an opportunity, everyone is eager!"

He continued with a smile, "And one more thing... we are soldiers! Ancient soldiers! Since the Human Lord has created this opportunity for us, then... give us a better choice!"

"What?"

Su Yu was puzzled. Injure Cangshan Ming heavily for you to fight?

Mountain Rise grinned, "This time, Human Lord, don't teleport us! Including the boss and the South Heavenly King... only us 27 and Cangshan Ming, a life-and-death battle! Whoever wins, comes out!"

Su Yu frowned. I just wanted you to get more rewards, not to send you to your deaths!

But Mountain Rise was serious, "Human Lord, sometimes, it's not just about having enough power of laws to reach the Daofuse Realm! We need life-and-death insights! We... ultimately haven't fought for too long! Heavendoom and the others also reached the Daofuse Realm through life-and-death battles, not just because they had enough power of laws!"

"If you also go in with us, we'll just think, it's fine, even if we lose, the Human Lord and the boss won't let us die, we're not afraid... No, it's not like that!"

Mountain Rise shook his head, "If that's the case, we have little hope of advancing! Because we've only absorbed the power of laws, without the great path laws, without deeper insights, even if we reach the Daofuse Realm... we'll just be weak, like the weak Daofuse in the Three Body Method!"

Mountain Rise smiled, "The Spirit Suppression Army, the first army under King Gong! A strong army that can match or even surpass the strong armies under other kings! We are soldiers, not babies. Human Lord, if we truly die in there, it's because we're not skilled enough! At that time... the Human Lord doesn't need to kill Cangshan Ming. As long as he's willing to submit to the Human Lord, the Human Lord can pardon his crimes. I think he'd be willing to serve the Human Lord!"

Mountain Rise's suggestion left Su Yu unable to decide for a moment. This wasn't the outcome he wanted! He was truly worried that these people would be killed. If that happened... it would be a huge problem! He had spent a great deal of effort to release 27 guardians. If they were killed by Cangshan Ming here, all the advantages he had built up would vanish, and without these people, future campaigns against the Upper Realm would be much more difficult.

Mountain Rise knew he was hesitating and knelt on one knee on the river's surface, saying solemnly, "Emperor Yu, we want to fight! We also know that Emperor Yu paid a great price to rescue us, but... if we don't fight to the death, if we don't experience the strength of a Heavenly King, we might struggle to match the ancient marquises! Right now, we're dealing with necromancer marquises, far less versatile than living marquises!"

"And in the Upper Realm, they're all strong! All have fought for countless years! Does Emperor Yu want 27 who can only fight weak Daofuse, or 27 truly brave and battle-hardened Weapon Fusion Method experts?"

He was asking Su Yu what he wanted! A group of weaklings? Three Daofuse to fight one Daofuse in the Upper Realm? 27 Daofuse might only be able to fight seven or eight ancient marquises, at most, because they had advanced to the Daofuse Realm too recently, hadn't fought for years, and lacked experience at this level, with insufficient insights into the great path.

This was something Su Yu hadn't considered before! Yes, he hadn't thought about this. He thought that once these people reached the Daofuse Realm, they should be similar to Heavendoom and the others. In reality, he had underestimated Heavendoom. Just because Heavendoom hadn't won a fight didn't mean he was weak. He was extremely strong; it was just that his opponents were all top-tier experts.

At this moment, Old Turtle's expression also changed, wanting to speak, but Mountain Rise laughed, "Boss, we're not kids anymore! We're soldiers! Our Spirit Suppression Army, although long out of battle, might be the only ancient army still intact!"

"If Emperor Yu needs a group of weak Daofuse, then we can let the boss and you go in with us. If we really can't win, the boss and you can intervene!"

Upon hearing this, Cangshan Ming's expression changed. That wouldn't do!

Su Yu hesitated, clearly torn by the situation. Meanwhile, Old Turtle observed them for a long moment before letting out a bitter laugh. "Shan Qi, I know you're competing with Heavendoom..."

"General!" Shan Qi suddenly shouted in anger. "I am a soldier. I am not competing with Heavendoom! Everything I've said isn't about competition. I'm simply asking Emperor Yu whether he wants an elite Daofuse army or a weak Daofuse army that can only grow through constant feeding!"

He wasn't competing! At least, that's what he believed.

Old Turtle's expression shifted slightly, and he hesitated. This wasn't what he wanted; it wasn't his original intention. But when he saw the 27 old comrades kneeling on one knee, waiting for him to make a decision, he knew that Su Yu was also waiting for him to decide. After all, these men were his soldiers.

Su Yu couldn't make the decision easily. If the 27 guardians truly perished in battle, it would inevitably create a rift between him and Old Turtle.

After a long pause, Old Turtle sighed in defeat. "I am not a good general. You are all brave and battle-hardened, but I... very well, I won't stop you! I just hope you can... return safely!"

He agreed!

For a moment, Su Yu wasn't sure if this was the right decision. An elite army... 

After a while, Su Yu spoke, "Hetu and Lanshan will accompany you. If the Spirit Suppression Army is defeated, escort Cangshan Ming out of the realm. If victorious... the two of you will devour his remains on the spot!"

Su Yu coldly looked at Cangshan Ming. "You heard me! If you win, you have a chance to live. If you lose... there will be no place for you to be buried!"

Cangshan Ming calculated in his mind before speaking in a low voice, "Where do you want me to go?"

"Luminous Domain Mansion!"

"Luminous Domain Mansion?" He didn't know what that place was.

Su Yu replied indifferently, "The ancient land where the Human Race unified the Myriad Realms! It is now abandoned! Of course, there's no escape route there. You won't find the exit, nor can you leave. You can try if you don't believe me!"

Cangshan Ming, once a top-tier expert, hesitated for a moment before quickly deciding, "Fine, I'll take this chance!"

Here, he was certain to die. The Celestial River of Death no longer had any powerful resurrections, and even if they did resurrect, they likely wouldn't dare to show themselves. Staying here, he had no hope of survival, not even the ability to take someone down with him.

He was unwilling! He was willing to gamble for a chance to live!

The passage wasn't far from here. Soon, Su Yu stopped talking and quickly flew toward the passage, with the others following closely behind.

Old Turtle and the South King were responsible for keeping an eye on Cangshan Ming.

Before long, they reached the passage.

The Martial Emperor might still be in a rage, but Su Yu knew that guy wouldn't interfere, much less kill the guardians. He wasn't foolish; he needed the guardians to win, to kill Cangshan Ming and gain the power of laws reward!

So, the 27 guardians had only one enemy: Cangshan Ming!

At this moment, everyone felt immense pressure. This gamble wasn't necessary, but Shan Qi's words were true. Do you want an army that grows weak through feeding, or a strong army?

What did Su Yu want? Of course, a strong army! But if they failed, the cost would be enormous!

At this moment, Su Yu transmitted a message to Hetu, "I won't go in. If I do, they'll think I look down on them. You stay inside and watch. If there's real danger, summon Marquis Tongtian! With Marquis Tongtian and Marquis Lanshan working together, plus them, they should be able to win!"

"When?" Hetu asked, then added, "At what casualty rate should I call Marquis Tongtian to join the battle?"

Su Yu hesitated for a moment before quickly responding, "Half! No, if 10 guardians die, act immediately!"

"I understand!"

Hetu remembered his words and added, "Marquis Lanshan might not listen to me..."

"I'll ensure she follows your orders!"

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Hetu said no more, and neither did Su Yu, except to instruct Marquis Lanshan to follow Hetu's orders once inside.

Soon, 30 strong individuals, including Hetu and the others, spread out across the various large stars.

Cangshan Ming felt a small thrill. Could he escape once transported inside? Although Su Yu said there was no escape, he still wanted to try.

The next moment, Su Yu activated the teleportation!

In an instant, the group vanished from where they stood.

Once they left, Old Turtle looked dejected, unable to maintain his composure. He anxiously said, "Emperor Yu, these guys are too arrogant! Killing a Heavenly King isn't easy; they're merely Eternals! If Cangshan Ming breaks them one by one, it's over!"

Earlier, he could barely maintain his composure. Now that they were gone, he was truly worried.

"10,000 years ago, I already let them down once. I don't want them to die like this now!"

Old Turtle was agitated and uneasy. His nature wasn't like this; he was usually calm and composed. But at this moment, he was truly anxious, speaking without thinking, "I'd rather they become weak Daofuse cultivators and live long. If they can't beat the Upper Realm's strong, then they should just run..."

He stopped abruptly, glancing at Su Yu.

Su Yu seemed not to hear him, reassuring, "It's alright. I've arranged for Marquis Lanshan and Marquis Tongtian to be ready. Both are improving in strength! If it truly comes to a crisis, they will act!"

Old Turtle remained uneasy, while the South King frowned, "So indecisive! Hongmeng, no wonder you've never reached the peak of the Heavenly King realm, always just a bit short!"

Old Turtle was strong, but indeed not as strong as the Four Heavenly Kings. His personality was one factor, his understanding of the dao another.

Old Turtle sighed helplessly, "I'm just worried..."

"In ancient wars, countless died. In today's situation, how can there be no deaths?" The South King said coldly, "That Shan Qi, I quite admire! He's right, including Su Yu. I find you all hope for perfect plans, no deaths if possible. How is that possible? Even the Culture King, with all his strategies, saw countless humans die in the wars across the Myriad Realms!"

"If Su Yu hadn't sought perfection, the North King would have struggled to escape! At that time, if Su Yu had acted, joining me to suppress the North King, Lanshan would surpass ordinary Daofuse. Once Lanshan killed a Death Spirit Marquis, a Death Spirit Marquis would surely flee! Killing the North King would have been highly likely!"

Letting the North King escape made her feel that Su Yu still had flaws. Too much sentimentality!

Yes, of course, she didn't find it inappropriate because she believed Su Yu was inherently that kind of person, with a touch of sentimentality. Otherwise, he wouldn't have called her 'Master's Wife' when they first met.

He was a pure-hearted child!

And Su Yu nodded, saying nothing more. There were some things he didn't mention.

Big Sister, it's not that I don't want to do it, but... I lack the capital!

There are too many Daofuse in the Upper Realm, and with the Hundred Battle King's precedent, the various races are now very wary of me using them as cannon fodder. If foreign Daofuse die while human Daofuse remain unharmed, it could easily trigger a mutiny!

Otherwise, Su Yu wouldn't have to think so carefully, always aiming to kill the enemy at the lowest cost!

The Hundred Battle King had walked this path to its end!

Even Death Spirit Marquis couldn't be casually sacrificed.

The North King escaped, but Su Yu wasn't too worried. He smiled, "The North King fled. When we fought the Celestial River of Death, he didn't dare to act but chose to flee. Next, he's unlikely to attack again!"

The South King frowned and nodded, "But we must still be cautious. If Cangshan Ming dies... he was an extremely powerful being. If no Heavenly King Death Spirit emerges to fill the void, and so many Marquises and Monarchs die, a strong being might be born!"

"What about you, South King?" Su Yu looked at her. Don't you have hope?

The South King frowned, "I'm still a bit short. I'm not even as hopeful as the North King! The best solution is to birth more Death Spirit Daofuse, or simply have a Death Spirit Heavenly King emerge to fill the void in the dao!"

Su Yu nodded, looking toward the distant Celestial River of Death.

The South King also looked, speaking solemnly, "There must still be many strong beings, but they don't dare to show themselves now! Once things calm down a bit, these guys should unite again, and they'll be more cautious than before!"

Cangshan Ming was too careless, too trusting of the North King, thinking the North King would join the battle. Or rather, he thought he was helping the North King, not the other way around. Su Yu's sudden attack caught him off guard.

If Su Yu had attacked the North King, he would have surely led the Death Spirit Marquises into battle.

Su Yu nodded again.

The two chatted, ignoring Old Turtle, who was restless and helpless.

What to do?

Will there be deaths?

How many?

He didn't want these old comrades to die, but he couldn't stop them.

Seeing Old Turtle's anxiety, Su Yu felt a bit helpless. He quickly said, "General of the Spirit Suppression Army, wait at the entrance to the seventh floor. If there's danger, you can sneak in. I'll have Marquis Tongtian coordinate with you, ready to transport you to the battlefield at any time!"

"You should have said so earlier..."

Old Turtle vanished instantly. At this moment, he couldn't care less about maintaining Su Yu's face; he was almost dying of anxiety!

In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.

The South King frowned slightly, "This Hongmeng, so indecisive! His strength isn't weak, but he can participate in battles, not lead one. Otherwise... if he encounters a strong enemy, he will surely lose!"

"He can't let go of his old brothers."

Su Yu smiled, "It's a good thing. A bit more humanity is good! Didn't Master's Wife also have trouble letting go of the Culture King? And I, too, have things I can't let go of... If a person truly has no desires or needs, they can't be restrained! If they truly have no desires or needs, why would they fight for me?"

He didn't think Old Turtle had a big problem. If someone truly had no desires or needs, why would they help you?

The South King was slightly taken aback, silent for a long time, then nodded slightly, "Perhaps you're right!"

She didn't argue.

Perhaps Su Yu was right. If she truly had no desires or needs, why would she help the Human Race?

Wasn't it because she couldn't let go of certain things?

Su Yu took the opportunity to ask, "Master's Wife, back then, when the Culture King came here, was it to resurrect someone?"

The South King frowned, "It seems so. He didn't say, and I didn't ask. I didn't dare to ask, nor was it appropriate to ask."

She didn't dare!

This is also a point to consider. The Culture King was so upright and virtuous that ordinary people felt inferior in his presence. The South King was no exception. 

"I am merely a death spirit, while he is the overlord of the Myriad Realms, the foremost figure among them. At one point, I even found the Culture King more charismatic than the Human Emperor," the South King mused.

It wasn't the South King! Su Yu was certain now. The Culture King had come, but not to resurrect the South King. It was likely for Xingyue. But who exactly was Xingyue? A being who had swallowed the mark of a death spirit marquis, existing at the sixth stage of the Eternal realm, unable to advance for countless ages. Did Xingyue even know her own identity?

There was no time to ponder this further. Su Yu quickly asked, "Does the mistress know how to resurrect someone?"

The South King pondered for a moment before replying, "I'm not entirely sure, but... it's extremely difficult! I don't know the exact steps, but I do know it requires certain things, including various powers of the Great Dao. It's not as simple as having enough vitality to revive someone. I've vaguely heard that it even requires suppressing the death spirit's Great Dao, but the death spirit's Great Dao is immensely powerful. How can it be suppressed?"

The South King shook her head and continued, "However, it seems the Culture King had done some research. It requires certain tools—brush, ink, paper, and inkstone. The brush seals, the ink suppresses, the paper bestows the path of the living, and the inkstone grants the power of life..."

She explained briefly, knowing only this much.

Su Yu was slightly taken aback. All four Daos were needed! The brush seals, the ink suppresses... How does the ink suppress? Can the ink suppress the death spirit's Great Dao? Impossible!

Su Yu said solemnly, "Ink suppresses... brush seals... does this mean they want to strip the death spirit's path from the Great Dao of death spirits? I have a vague idea now. Stripping the death spirit's path, not entangling it with the Great Dao, using a powerful physical force to grant some life force, and the paper... perhaps it can recreate a new path, the path of the living!"

He might not be wrong in his speculation. If so, resurrecting someone would be exceedingly difficult, much harder than anticipated! Even the Culture King hadn't succeeded. Was it because he wasn't strong enough? Unlikely! Or perhaps the Culture King couldn't strip the path from the death spirit's Great Dao, in which case, Su Yu might not succeed either.

"If he's here to resurrect Xingyue, Xingyue... Xingyu, could she be the Human Emperor's daughter?" Su Yu wondered. Wasn't the Human Emperor a bachelor? Could there be an illegitimate daughter? Even if there was, shouldn't the Human Emperor be the one concerned, not the Culture King? Or was his judgment wrong?

Forget it, he decided not to dwell on this. At this moment, he looked towards the teleportation passage and exhaled. He didn't know if the 27 guardians could kill Cangshan Ming. If they couldn't and suffered casualties, he would incur a great loss this time.

As for the North King and others escaping, let them escape!

Su Yu stopped thinking about it and quickly turned his attention to the crowd. A group of death spirit lords and marquises were still suppressing several death spirit marquises!

Su Yu looked at the crowd and said solemnly, "Reward the eight Eternal ninth-stage lords with one death spirit mark each!"

Light points scattered from his hand, landing on the eight death spirit lords. He had been observing all along, and these eight were valiant in battle, much more so than the other lords! This time, they had killed exactly eight death spirit lords, with only five others suppressed, and the rest had fled.

The eight lords were overjoyed and knelt, shouting, "Long live Emperor Yu!"

"Quickly absorb the death spirit marks. If you can advance, now is the best time. The Great Dao is in turmoil, and many positions are vacant!"

Indeed, this was the best time to advance!

Soon, several lords began absorbing the death spirit marks and death blood, while the other lords could only watch enviously. The death spirit marquises were also envious, but Su Yu's allocation could better strengthen their combat power.

The enhancement from a death spirit marquis swallowing a mark was limited.

After distributing these, Su Yu fell silent, waiting patiently in the teleportation passage. If the battle ended, he would know. If they advanced, the human race's fortune would undoubtedly rise! If they all perished, the human race's fortune would diminish significantly.

...

In the Luminous Domain Mansion.

The Martial Emperor was sulking. His hair had been cut off in many places. At this moment, on the negative first floor, the battle was also extremely bloody!

The 27 guardians, who had fought countless battles in the past and were skilled in combat, faced an opponent too strong! Cangshan Ming focused on one person, shattering Shanqu's petrified body and breaking his flesh!

Cangshan Ming wanted to quickly kill some guardians, breaking their joint force!

However, these guardians were old friends. Their teamwork was not rusty. As soon as Shanqu was severely injured, another guardian replaced him, blocking Cangshan Ming with a slash.

The battle was brutal!

In the blink of an eye, seven or eight guardians were severely injured, while Cangshan Ming was also bleeding black blood, his death aura fluctuating.

The power of the death spirit's Great Dao suppressed the guardians, the Great Dao was too strong, wearing them down physically and mentally.

...

In the distance.

Hetu frowned slightly. At this rate, even if the 27 guardians won, few would survive. He pondered for a moment and quickly transmitted, "Marquis Lanshan, let's quickly devour the death spirit marks to strengthen ourselves and share the power of the Great Dao! Otherwise, with so many vacancies in the Great Dao now, Cangshan Ming might grow stronger as the battle progresses!"

Marquis Lanshan didn't say much. The two sat cross-legged, quickly devouring the death spirit marks they had. These were left from previous killings.

Hetu's idea was simple. By advancing to Daofuse, he could seize some control over the Great Dao, as could Marquis Lanshan. If there were death spirits advancing outside, they would seize more.

If he guessed correctly, Su Yu might be rewarding some death spirit lords, helping them advance to Daofuse.

Since regaining many memories and his original mind, Hetu was as wise as before, no longer easily angered or foolish!

He was already close to Daofuse. Now, devouring the death spirit marks, comprehending the power of the Great Dao, and observing the battle of the Heavenly Kings...

Moments later, his aura fluctuated slightly.

After a while, a powerful death aura surged into the sky!

In the distance, Cangshan Ming's death aura weakened slightly, and he was furious. The other guardians didn't know the situation and didn't sense it, but Cangshan Ming cursed inwardly!

Another Daofuse had emerged, and in this place devoid of death aura, he would be weakened somewhat, albeit slightly.

But he was indeed weakened!

No time to think about it, the guardians were also going crazy. Some chose to shatter their petrification techniques, their weapons bursting with powerful force, turning the world upside down!

The fierce battle continued!

Guardians flew out one after another!

Cangshan Ming's aura gradually weakened, while Marquis Lanshan and Hetu were strengthening themselves. Outside, two of the eight lords had even advanced to Daofuse.

They were already close, and with the death spirit's Great Dao loosening, it was the best time for them to advance.

Su Yu had arranged for all the death spirit marquises, including the South King, to start cultivating, seizing more power of the Great Dao!

The fleeing North King and others reached the Land of the Abyss and immediately began cultivating to strengthen themselves.

Similarly, in the distance, Xia Chen and Liu Hong also found opportunities to strengthen themselves.

In the Celestial River of Death, many beings were absorbing the power of laws, strengthening themselves.

Opportunities were rare!

Many death spirit marquises and lords had died today, making it a grand feast!

...

At the same time.

In the realm of the living.

In a small, weak realm, some Sunmoon and Shanhai cultivators gathered together.

Soon, an eye appeared on the body of an Immortal Sunmoon, and the aura and gaze of that Sunmoon changed—Tiangu!

Yes, it was Tiangu's aura.

In the blink of an eye, the auras of several other powerful beings also changed.

Tiangu possessed this Sunmoon and said solemnly, "We have been unable to gather in person, making it difficult to discuss certain matters. Today is a good opportunity to meet and talk!"

There were many people present.

Tiangu, the Symbol King, the Phoenix Emperor, Jiwu, Demon Halberd, Demon Leap, the Ape Emperor, Abyss Marquis, Heavenly Dragon Marquis, and the Nether Emperor—ten Daofuse realm beings in total.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao were not invited.

"The Spirit Emperor, Lingyuan, Longdou, Golden-winged Roc, and the Weapon King—all five living Daofuse fell in the last battle!" Tiangu said solemnly. "The Symbol King went to the Death Realm, and two death spirit marquises were killed... The losses from the last battle were too severe!"

Everyone's expressions were grim.

"Su Yu has grown too fast!" Tiangu said solemnly. "Recently, I've been very uneasy! For the first time in ten thousand years, I feel this way! In the ninth tidal battle, we won, annihilating nearly a hundred Daofuse of the human alliance! However, we also suffered significant losses. Because the human race was weakened, many of our Daofuse chose to ascend to the Upper Realm!"

In the past, each race wouldn't leave only one Daofuse to guard, sometimes five or six, at least two or three.

But this time, due to the severe losses of the human race, in order to besiege the human race, many Daofuse ascended to the Upper Realm, resulting in a scarcity of Daofuse in the lower realm.

Now, the drawbacks were evident.

Jiwu said coldly, "Tiangu, if your Immortal race hadn't harbored ill intentions from the start, it wouldn't have come to this. In the past, your Immortal race even allied with the human race..."

Tiangu frowned, "Back then, it wasn't just because of the Immortal race's ambition! There was also the thought of leaving the human race to lure out some of the old human relics from the Upper Realm, and even to draw out any remaining Torchbearers!"

"Who could have predicted that after suppressing the human race for hundreds of years, such a change would occur in the last ten years before the Upper Realm opened? No one could have foreseen it!"

Just a few more years, and the Upper Realm would have opened!

Blaming the Immortal race for being ambitious, weren't the gods and demons the same? Initially, they hadn't decided to annihilate the human race completely; they wanted to lure all the old relics from the Upper Realm to rescue the human race!

They also wanted to draw out any remaining Torchbearers from the human race!

In the end, they stumbled and fell.

Tiangu spoke, "In a way, it's a good thing. At least now, some people have been exposed! This includes some of the contingencies left by the Culture King, like the Book Spirit and the Tea Plant. Even the blood essence Su Yu consumed has been exposed, as well as the Great Zhou King. He is definitely not from this tide of the Human Race. The Iron Devourer Race and other ancient races have also been exposed. Once this tide ends, all remnants will be eradicated!"

The Demon Halberd spoke softly, "Let's not talk about this. Tiangu, what do you mean by calling us here now? According to the previous plan, we were all supposed to lie low and wait for the Upper Realm to open. There's no need to engage in a bloody battle with the Human Race at this moment. Once the Upper Realm opens, the Human Race will be annihilated..."

Tiangu took a deep breath, "I feel uneasy! Extremely uneasy! I'm worried that in another seven or eight years, what if Su Yu becomes a master of the power of laws?"

"Impossible!" The Demon Halberd said in a deep voice, "In the past hundred thousand years, no new master of the power of laws has emerged! Even the Hundred Battle King didn't succeed!"

"But what if?" Tiangu said solemnly, "That's why I think we need to deal with Su Yu. Even if we don't kill anyone else, we must deal with Su Yu first!"

"Difficult!" Jiwu shook his head, "If Su Yu were easy to kill, he would have been killed long ago!"

Tiangu nodded, "Even if we can't kill Su Yu, my idea is to consume a large amount of the power of laws! Open the Upper Realm ahead of time, even if only slightly, weaken the power of laws, and let more Daofuse Realm experts descend! Right now, even with Duobao and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, we only have twelve Daofuse Realm experts!"

"On the Human Race's side, there are two from the God Devourer Race, Hongmeng, the Book Spirit, the Tea Plant, the Great Zhou King, the Iron Devourer Beast Emperor, the Space Beast Emperor, the Hou Pseudo Emperor, and the Ancient Giant King, making a total of ten. If Su Yu succeeds in fusing his dao, he might also possess Daofuse Realm combat power. Moreover, the blood essence he consumed last time suggests there might be another behind him, which is the dog the Heavenly Overseer Marquis mentioned, making it twelve..."

Tiangu sighed, "We are evenly matched, and we might even be at a slight disadvantage! Moreover, I can't clearly see some of Su Yu's recent actions. I don't fully understand them!"

The crowd gradually grew solemn.

They all looked at Tiangu, wondering what he meant.

Tiangu said quietly, "Each faction has many Sunmoon Realm peaks and many quasi-Eternals! Prove the dao! Don't use the Three Body Method to prove the dao; take other paths. Each faction should have some preparations! Use the Sunmoon Realm peaks to bring down some Daofuse Realm experts secretly! Tianyuan Marquis, keep a close watch on the Life Realm, and don't let any information leak out. Catch Su Yu off guard!"

"Secretly prove the dao, trigger the punishment of the power of laws, and maybe by sacrificing thirty to fifty Sunmoon Realm experts, we can bring down one or two more Daofuse Realm experts!"

The expressions of the crowd changed slightly, and Tiangu sneered, "Reluctant? It shouldn't be! Consider it yourselves. Our Immortal Race can let thirty Sunmoon Realm experts choose other paths to prove the dao. If they succeed, that's great; more paths mean a brighter future! If they fail, they can still trigger the punishment of the power of laws!"

"But don't always rely on the Immortal Race. Is this just our problem?"

Tiangu said coldly, "If we don't act now, we might not have another chance! First, secretly bring down five or six Daofuse Realm experts to catch Su Yu off guard. Finally, find a way to kill Hongmeng, so Su Yu loses his greatest support! Our race previously contacted the East Heavenly King, who said he would act, but there's been no movement. I'm worried something might happen over there..."

The Demon Halberd pondered for a moment and nodded, "We still need to prepare on both fronts! We can't just wait idly! If Su Yu really reaches the level of a master of the power of laws in the next few years, even if the Upper Realm descends, it will suffer heavy losses! It's better to let some Daofuse Realm experts descend in advance..."

After speaking, he added, "The Demon Race will also send thirty Sunmoon Realm experts to prove their dao! If they succeed, everyone will be happy. If they fail, losing some Sunmoon Realm experts is better than losing Daofuse Realm experts. Using Sunmoon Realm experts to exchange for Daofuse Realm experts is worth it!"

The other Daofuse Realm experts from various races thought for a while and quickly nodded.

Tiangu smiled, finally persuading them this time. These guys were really troublesome. He quickly said, "Then act after returning! Keep a low profile, and make sure to watch the Life Realm closely! Otherwise, if the information leaks, it will be a big problem! Keep a close eye on the Life Emperor. That guy seems to be subtly leaning towards the Human Race this tide, which is not good! Abyss Marquis, no matter what, you must keep a close watch on him!"

"I will!" Abyss Marquis smiled faintly, "Rest assured! I'll keep a close watch on him! The Upper Realm doesn't trust him either; otherwise, I wouldn't have descended!"

Tiangu felt slightly relieved and added, "Each race should also try to contact the Death Realm again. We can't just wait! If the Heavenly Kings of the Death Realm act, Hongmeng can be eliminated!"

"We'll try, but... it's best to take the Abyssal Realm first. Otherwise, it's inconvenient to contact. The Great Zhou King sealed the Abyssal Realm to prevent us from entering the Death Realm through it."

"Find an opportunity to launch a war and take back the Abyssal Realm!"

"......"

A group of Daofuse Realm experts continued to discuss. In such a situation, some agreements that were previously impossible to reach were quickly made.

The key point was to disperse the power of the punishment of laws, ideally opening the Upper Realm in advance. If not, at least let a large number of Daofuse Realm experts descend to assist in the battle.

...

While they were taking action, Su Yu was eagerly waiting.

Has there been a result?

A battle between powerful beings ends quickly; there's no such thing as a fight dragging on for days.

Of course, if one flees and the other pursues, then it could drag on, but the people inside have no escape route.

His Human Lord Seal was fluctuating with intense fortune.

He didn't know what the outcome would be!

"I hope they can succeed in killing!"

Su Yu silently prayed. He had high hopes for the guardians of the Spirit Suppression Army!

Without the Spirit Suppression Army, Old Turtle and the others might lose their composure.

Su Yu was somewhat regretful. If he had known, he might have created some weak Daofuse Realm experts. It would be better than being anxious now. This feeling of waiting for the result was worse than going into battle himself!

At least, he would know the outcome!

Win or lose, he would know.

At this moment, a loud explosion suddenly echoed, and the Death Realm trembled. A great dao appeared, and a path was severed!

Su Yu was stunned, then overjoyed!

Cangshan Ming was killed?

They won?

But the next moment, Su Yu's expression changed. If they won, how many died?

If many died, it would be troublesome for him to explain!

Even though it was Shanqu's choice!

Su Yu didn't care if the Martial Emperor was angry or not. He instantly teleported in, regardless of whether the Martial Emperor was pleased!

If he dared, let him come and fight me!

As soon as he teleported in, he saw a towering pillar of rules. The next moment, the Martial Emperor appeared before him, filled with boundless anger, as if he wanted to devour Su Yu!

"Move aside, I have something to do..."

"Su Yu, I will kill you!" The Martial Emperor's figure was complete, and a full shadow suddenly appeared, throwing a punch at Su Yu!

Su Yu was shocked!

This guy's unsealing was not weak, troublesome!

This place, next time, I might not be able to enter.

At this moment, he couldn't even bother to look over there. He had to first subdue this Martial Emperor, this bastard. Even if he unsealed, he hadn't completely broken free yet!

Boom!

The recent battle had just ended, and in the blink of an eye, Su Yu and the Martial Emperor's shadow were fighting, turning the world upside down.

In the void, a fist and a pen constantly intertwined, shattering countless strands of hair on the entire negative first floor, forcibly turning the Martial Emperor into a bald head!
