Chapter 838: White Robes Are Not to Be Trifled With!

In the River of Time.

The figures of Zhan Wang and Xingyue had already appeared.

Zhan Wang, at this moment, also looked towards Su Yu and his group. They were quite far away, but Zhan Wang was slightly surprised; it seemed there were quite a few people.

*This… they even brought those below the ruler of laws?*

*This… won't be of much use!*

Although there were still some who weren't rulers of laws here, after years of battle, those who survived, to put it bluntly, were almost all top-tier Daofuse cultivators. For instance, among the human race's eighty-plus ancient marquises, most were Heavenly Kings or even Heavenly Venerables!

Nothing else, some Daos simply couldn't become rulers of laws.

Otherwise, many of these people could have become rulers of laws.

Most were Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables. The rest were generally top-tier Daofuse cultivators. As for third-grade or fourth-grade Daofuse cultivators, they were practically non-existent.

The people here were originally ancient elites.

Zhan Wang pondered, *How many people?*

*Over thirty?*

*How many are rulers of laws?*

*Four or five?*

*Or more, five or six?*

*Or… it couldn't just be Su Yu, could it? That would be too pathetic!*

At this moment

The Hundred Battle King, while crashing into the Martial Emperor, venomously remarked, “You, a defeated subordinate of the Martial King, have now emerged and still dare to fight me…”

The Martial Emperor’s expression instantly changed. *Are you looking for a beating?*

*You’re forcing my hand!*

The Martial Emperor’s body immediately swelled. With a thunderous boom, he sent the Hundred Battle King reeling back. A long spear appeared in the Martial Emperor’s hand, and he gritted his teeth. “You’ve angered me, little fatty. If I don’t beat you to death today, I won’t be able to face myself!”

*Go to hell, you old bastard!*

*Boom!*

The long spear swept out, striking the long saber. March seized the opportunity to bring a bamboo pole down. The Hundred Battle King’s heart suddenly jolted with a sense of dread. *What is this thing?*

Before the dread could subside, the Undead Emperor summoned countless stars, encircling the Hundred Battle King. *Boom!* The stars crashed into him one after another, forcing the Hundred Battle King to continuously retreat!

The Hundred Battle King was indeed powerful!

Without using the power of laws, or rather, without using the power of laws exceeding the ruler of laws realm, three against one, they only barely gained a slight advantage.

One had to know, these three were considered the strongest among Su Yu’s subordinates.

And the Hundred Battle King was not the strongest under the Human Emperor; the Radiant King was still around!

Su Yu watched for a while, his eyebrows slightly raised. *Not weak!*

Or rather, *very strong!*

Su Yu assessed the situation. Without the boost of world power, he would at most be on par with the Hundred Battle King, perhaps even slightly weaker.

Of course, this wasn’t a life-and-death struggle, so it was hard to say who would win.

But the Hundred Battle King’s strength still made Su Yu somewhat solemn.

A single Hundred Battle King almost suppressed everyone on this side. Yet, such an existence was not the top-tier under the Human Emperor. However, the Human Emperor’s side was severely suppressed by the Myriad Races.

It was clear that there were many second-tier existences among the Myriad Races, and perhaps even some first-tier ones.

…

Su Yu was startled.

And the Hundred Battle King was actually startled too. *These three are quite formidable!*

Of course, with the Martial Emperor present, their strength was to be expected. The Martial Emperor had been stronger than him back then, only to be sealed all these years. Otherwise, the Martial Emperor of yesteryear could have easily thrashed him!

But the Martial Emperor had been subdued by Su Yu… *that* was what was truly startling!

The four continued their great battle. The Hundred Battle King was still slightly suppressed, especially by March’s bamboo. It had a somewhat suppressive effect on him, which surprised the Hundred Battle King. *What is this thing? It feels like it’s putting pressure on me when it hits!*

That was the Human Ancestor’s Dao-proving weapon!

At this moment, March hadn’t even dared to unleash its full power, as the commotion would be too great. Even so, each strike of the bamboo pole made the Hundred Battle King slightly uncomfortable!

As the Hundred Battle King fought fiercely, his eyes flickered. He glanced at Su Yu’s side, noting the considerable number of people. He suddenly cleaved March back with a saber, then snorted. “Human Lord Su, do your subordinates only consist of these old fellows and foreign races?”

“So… it’s still the foundation we left behind… right?”

…

Su Yu smiled.

Originally, he had only intended for those three to give him a beating. But now… *he wants to probe further?*

Su Yu chuckled, then said calmly, “Prefect Wan, Senior Hundred Battle King looks down on those who rose after the ancient times… Go and spar with Senior Hundred Battle King!”

In an instant, many figures leaped out.

Wan Tiansheng, the Great Ming King, Xia Longwu, and Yingwu all stepped forward.

Su Yu smiled. “Senior Hundred Battle King, do ancient marquises count as old? If they do, I won’t let them attack…”

The Hundred Battle King’s heart stirred. He chuckled. “I’m a King, they’re Marquises. They’re all my grandsons! Come, all of you!”

“…”

At this moment, Giant Axe, Red Moon, Wu Ji, and the others were stunned.

*You… why are you scolding us?*

*We didn’t provoke you!*

At this moment, Su Yu’s voice rang out. “Since Senior wants to experience your profound skills, go ahead. All humans, go. Non-humans, just watch. Martial Emperor, you all withdraw for now!”

And at this moment, even more people stepped out!

There were quite a few ancient marquises.

Among the humans: Red Moon, Blood Shadow, Yingwu, Xuelan, Lanshan…

A whole group of humans!

The Hundred Battle King was stunned. *So many?*

*Daofuse cultivators coming to fight me is useless!*

*It can’t be that they’re all rulers of laws, can it?*

*Boom!*

Without a second thought, a saber strike came from the opposite side. Xia Longwu’s face was filled with excitement, or rather, exhilaration. “Junior will learn from Senior’s saber techniques! My respects!”

He didn’t state his identity, fearing the Hundred Battle King would use his seniority to suppress him.

*Fight first, ask questions later!*

*After the fight, we can discuss our relationship!*

Xia Longwu was also a martial arts fanatic. Not many humans used sabers. His grandfather did, but it wasn’t appropriate to spar with his grandfather. Now… the Hundred Battle King was separated by who knew how many generations, so he would fight first!

*Boom!*

A saber strike came. The next moment, the Great Qin King laughed. “Qin Spear will learn from you!”

“I’ll set

Battle King wanted to retaliate, but each time he was about to, he was seen through. On the periphery, Destiny and Fate Emperor both opened their eyes, constantly transmitting information to Tongtian, predicting!
Observing qi!
Every attack path of Battle King was seen through by the two, instantly relayed to Tongtian, who quickly shifted the target of his attacks to the stronger Chaos Dragon or Eight-Winged Tiger.

They were all the type with powerful physical bodies! Xingyue and the others were all targets, but similarly, Tongtian would also send some people around him to deal with Battle King.

*Boom!*
A series of loud crashes erupted, one after another. Moments later, a desperate shriek rang out. "Damn it, that's too much! I surrender! Stop hitting me!"
It was too much!
So many people ganging up on him, it was utterly excessive!
They were all rulers of laws!
*Ah!*
All of them!

Battle King was both furious and delighted!
Furious because he had been so unlucky, failing to realize he was about to be pummeled by over thirty rulers of laws. Delighted because, *my heavens*, over thirty!
Oh my god!
At this moment, Battle King's joy far outweighed his anger.
Su Yu… had brought over thirty rulers of laws!
It was unbelievable, unimaginable!
He was utterly stunned!

Su Yu hadn't brought just a few kittens; he had brought a group of rulers of laws that

Zhan Wang said, seeing that the two still seemed to be thinking about the Martial Emperor, he said dryly, “Um… Your Majesty, their strength is not weak!”

The Human Emperor smiled. “The Martial Emperor is here? That’s a bit unexpected, not weak… But can Su Yu suppress him?”

“He can!”

Zhan Wang said decisively.

Seeing the Human Emperor and Radiant King surprised, he said dryly, “They… 36 of them… all are rulers of laws!”

Boom!

The Radiant King’s aura instantly erupted. The next moment, he suddenly roared, “You bastards opposite, come out and fight! I’ve long found you an eyesore. Your Majesty, let’s fight them! Something seems to have happened in the Myriad Realms!”

“…”

From the opposite continent, a grand sneer came. “Something happened? It seems… your sensing abilities have weakened! Human Emperor, retreat early and return to the Myriad Realms!”

The Radiant King cursed angrily, “Fuck your ancestors, get lost! I was just saying. Your Majesty, let’s not fight, let’s outlast them!”

“…”

Soon, both sides fell silent.

The Radiant King didn’t care about this either, merely shouting a few words to suppress his surprised heart. At this moment, he looked horrified. “All 36 of them?”

“Yes!”

Zhan Wang bared his teeth. “Too many! I didn’t know at first and suffered a bit. The Martial Emperor entered the second rank, and Su Yu suppressed the Martial Emperor… I think… he might also be second rank! There are many third ranks, and almost all the rest are fourth ranks. Fifth ranks… seem to be none!”

This time, even the Human Emperor’s phantom trembled!

36 of them!

“Not just that, some of them haven’t arrived yet…”

The Human Emperor suddenly said, “Zhou Tian… has he come?”

“No!”

Zhan Wang shook his head. “Didn’t see him!”

The Human Emperor instantly fell into deep thought. At this moment, his heart was also incredibly shocked: 36 of them!

Zhou Tian didn’t come!

That meant these people were not cultivated by Zhou Tian.

What’s going on?

I don’t have much of a sensation… Doesn’t that mean they might be rulers of laws cultivated in Su Yu’s own world!

This time, he had to gasp!

And Zhan Wang, seeing the Human Emperor’s phantom trembling, said dryly, “Your Majesty, the Martial Emperor isn’t dead. Um, let’s just continue to be shocked by this news, and you don’t need to be too nervous…”

The Human Emperor was speechless!

Do I need you to comfort me?

What am I nervous about!

I’m just surprised!

Surprised by Su Yu’s incredibleness!

How is this possible!

The next moment, the Human Emperor’s phantom trembled. Suddenly, a small shadow appeared, and the Human Emperor’s voice came. “My projection can’t leave… I’ll split another clone to go meet Su Yu! Radiant King, you also create a character clone. Zhan Wang… you take us to see Su Yu!”

This time, he no longer let Zhan Wang go alone.

He wanted to personally go and talk to Su Yu!

36 rulers of laws, all at once, shook the Human Emperor.

An opportunity!

And a crisis!

If he were in his prime, with so many people coming to his aid, he would dare to forcefully attack the Myriad Races right now!

But… now wasn’t the time.

He had some regrets. What a pity, he missed the timing. Otherwise, this would have been the battle to turn the tide!

What a shame!

At this moment, the Human Emperor was filled with regret, but also greatly invigorated.

I’ve waited for many years, and finally, the opportunity has arrived!

Su Yu… this grandson… *cough cough*, this tenth generation Human Lord, has done well!

“Originally, I wanted to beat this grandson to death… but now… it seems it’s not easy to make a move!”

At this moment, Zhan Wang suddenly thought of something and reminded him, “Your Majesty, he wears white robes and always has a smile. I thought the Culture King had returned. He doesn’t look like a good person at first glance!”

“Gasp!”

The Radiant King gasped. “He’s not to be trifled with! A white-robed figure with over 30 rulers of laws… Tsk tsk, troublesome!”

Normally, a white robe isn’t scary, but combined with Su Yu’s strength and identity, wow, he’s indeed not to be trifled with!

The Human Emperor was also startled. Another Culture King?

Well… he’s not impossible to deal with!

Didn’t I deal with the Culture King?

“Let’s go, let’s see!”

His phantom drilled into Zhan Wang’s body. The Radiant King also split off a character. They had to go meet this white-robed Human Lord!
