Chapter 838: The White Robe is Not to be Trifled With! (10,000-word update, please subscribe)

In the River of Time.

The shadows of the Hundred Battle King and Xingyue had already appeared. At this moment, the Hundred Battle King was also looking towards Su Yu and his group. Though they were quite a distance away, the Hundred Battle King was slightly surprised to see quite a number of people.

Is this... even those below the ruler of laws have come?

This... doesn't seem very useful!

Although there are some non-rulers of laws here, after years of battle, those who survived, to put it bluntly, are almost all top-tier Daofuse cultivators. For instance, among the more than eighty ancient marquises of the human race, most are Heavenly Kings or even Heavenly Venerables!

The reason is simple: some Daos cannot become rulers of laws. Otherwise, many of these people could have become rulers of laws.

Most are Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables, and the rest are generally top-tier Daofuse cultivators. As for third or fourth-tier Daofuse cultivators, they are almost nonexistent.

The people here are the elite of ancient times.

The Hundred Battle King pondered in his heart, how many people are there? More than thirty?

How many are rulers of laws? Four or five? Or maybe more, five or six? Or perhaps... is it just Su Yu alone? That would be too tragic!

At this moment, it wasn't appropriate to probe too deeply. They hadn't even met yet, and probing with willpower would be too disrespectful. After all, he was the tenth generation Human Lord, so he should at least show some respect.

The Hundred Battle King walked over with a smile, but the iron-blooded aura on him still seeped out a bit.

I am a king who has fought countless battles!

Am I impressive or not?

At this moment, Xingyue looked at the Hundred Battle King strutting around and felt a bit helpless. Don't be so cocky. Su Yu is petty. If you keep showing off, it might lead to trouble!

...

Meanwhile, beside Su Yu, the Martial Emperor slightly adjusted his appearance, avoiding the Hundred Battle King a bit. Even if he showed his true face, the Hundred Battle King might not remember him!

It had been too many years!

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King scanned the area, and his eyes first landed on Su Yu. Su Yu's hair was still white. Although he had opened up his own world, and his lifespan was no longer an issue, he had gotten used to the white hair and was too lazy to change it back to black.

Mainly because he was too young, and white hair made him look a bit more dashing. Black hair didn't match the white robe.

"A white robe?"

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King was taken aback. Oh, a white-robed cultivator. This... wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

In his life, he had seen many white-robed cultivators, most of whom were just for show. However, some white-robed ones were tricksters, some were sinister!

Seeing Su Yu's white hair and white robe, the Hundred Battle King was still a bit cautious.

White robes are not to be trifled with; this is a rule.

However, the most famous white-robed Culture King had disappeared, and the reputation of white-robed cultivators had somewhat diminished. The Hundred Battle King was slightly vigilant but not overly worried.

Besides... aren't we on the same side?

"Hahaha, is that Su Yu up ahead?"

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King laughed heartily, "I am the War King under the Imperial Court..."

"Bold!"

At this moment, a low shout rang out. Among the crowd, Heavendoom shouted, "How dare you call our emperor by name!"

The Hundred Battle King was stunned!

Damn you!

I am the Hundred Battle King, from the ancient imperial court. Let me think... I'm ranked sixth, okay!

I'm so old, and you have no respect for the elderly?

I can't possibly call Su Yu my boss, can I?

Thinking this, the Hundred Battle King didn't argue with Heavendoom, laughing heartily, "Human Lord Su, yes, Human Lord Su... I'm getting old, don't mind me!"

With that, he continued walking towards Su Yu, glancing at Heavendoom. He seemed to recognize him, but couldn't recall his name, with some doubt, "Is this... the Big Horse Monkey?"

"......"

Heavendoom's face turned black!

"Have I seen you somewhere before? I seem to remember a big horse monkey jumping around all day, seen at King Gong's mansion?"

He couldn't quite remember. It wasn't an insult; Heavendoom was a miscellaneous general without a title. As a top-tier ancient Human King, how could he remember Heavendoom's name so clearly? Having some impression meant Heavendoom wasn't doing too badly!

And Heavendoom, with a dark face, thought he had to deal with this old guy!

Who are you calling?

...

At this moment, Su Yu was also observing the Hundred Battle King.

An ancient king wouldn't be so rude or so boring as to call someone a big horse monkey... it was more of a test for Su Yu.

He wanted to see what kind of personality this tenth-generation Human Lord had.

Was he arrogant and domineering, or calm and composed, or kind and gentle...

He wasn't the Human Emperor, so even if he left a bad impression on Su Yu, it wouldn't change anything.

This was Su Yu's judgment.

The Hundred Battle King was used by the Human Emperor to test him. The Human Emperor wouldn't really send a reckless person to greet him. The Xia family was like this; they seemed reckless, but were actually very shrewd at heart!

He was testing Su Yu, and Su Yu also wanted to test the Human Emperor's attitude, and perhaps gauge the Human Emperor's tolerance.

The Human Emperor and Su Yu wouldn't personally step in, so they let their subordinates test each other.

As long as the top leaders didn't fall out, there was room for maneuver if conflicts arose below.

So, at this moment, Su Yu smiled and remained silent.

Seeing this, Heavendoom's eyes lit up, and he shouted, "Bold Hundred Battle King! We have fought across the world, sweeping through the Myriad Realms, and seeing the Human Emperor in distress, we came to help. You speak disrespectfully and dare to insult me!"

"Distress?"

The Hundred Battle King didn't like this either!

He glanced at Su Yu, seeing that he didn't stop him, and felt a bit unhappy.

The Human Emperor in distress?

You came to rescue?

That's the situation, but the Human Emperor isn't in distress; he's guarding the front line for you!

The Hundred Battle King was a bit annoyed, and his battle intent suddenly surged, with a bit of killing intent leaking out, though he restrained it a lot, coldly shouting, "You big horse monkey, how dare you! His Majesty is fighting on the front line, holding back strong enemies, and you dare insult His Majesty?"

Heavendoom shouted, "Stop talking nonsense, Hundred Battle King, how dare you release pressure in front of His Majesty, bold! You're disrespecting His Majesty, committing a crime... take him down!"

The Hundred Battle King laughed in anger!

Take me down?

I could chop you down with one strike!

If we weren't on the same side, and you, an outsider, dared to shout at me like this, I would have chopped you down long ago!

You have quite the nerve!

The Hundred Battle King was about to say something when suddenly, three figures flew out. The Hundred Battle King was stunned, and the next moment... he understood!

He glanced at Su Yu, who was smiling calmly.

The Hundred Battle King's heart tightened slightly... this... doesn't seem easy to deal with!

Is this... testing me?

Or testing the Human Emperor?

Is this to see the Human Emperor's attitude towards him?

But I am a top-tier ancient Human King. You could have tested with someone like King Ping, but testing me is asking for trouble, isn't it?

Even if I don't go all out, I'm not easy to deal with.

Just as he thought this, the Hundred Battle King snorted lightly, "Committing a crime? I am the Hundred Battle King, equal to the Human Lord. You big horse monkey are the one committing a crime... watch me smash your mouth!"

At this moment, both sides knew they were testing each other, but both were confident.

So, in an instant, four figures clashed together.

None went all out.

They didn't use the power of the Great Dao.

This was also a tacit understanding!

Using the power of the Great Dao now would easily attract the attention of the Myriad Races, so they almost relied on physical strength to fight. The stronger the person, the stronger the physical body, which is also a rule.

Boom!

The Hundred Battle King charged forward, initially planning to use fifty percent of his strength to knock these three guys away. Knowing he was the Hundred Battle King, they dared to come forward, so their strength was probably not weak, likely rulers of laws.

But they weren't fifth-tier, at most fourth-tier.

However, upon collision... a loud boom!

The Hundred Battle King first collided with the Martial Emperor, who retreated more than ten steps, while the Hundred Battle King retreated four or five steps. Before he could be shocked, a large bamboo pole struck with a bang, and he raised his fist, feeling intense pain!

The Hundred Battle King's expression changed again!

He retreated slightly, and suddenly, stars fell from the sky, hundreds of stars crashing down!

That was the attack of the Undead Emperor!

The Hundred Battle King roared, punching out, shattering countless stars. Just as he was about to counterattack, the Martial Emperor sneered and collided again, causing another loud boom!

The Hundred Battle King retreated, and the bamboo pole came again!

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King was shocked!

He had judged it!

Second-tier!

In physical collision, they were of the same tier, though slightly weaker. But the other two were also third-tier!

One second-tier, two third-tier!

"Martial Emperor?"

The Hundred Battle King was shocked, and the next moment realized who the opponent was, showing a look of surprise. The Martial Emperor thought he was surprised that he was alive, and sneered, "Your grandpa is still alive!"

His seniority was even older than the Hundred Battle King.

And the Hundred Battle King was shocked... how is he still alive?

Although the Human Emperor always said he was dead, it later became a joke, but everyone thought the Martial Emperor might have died. Yet unexpectedly, the Martial Emperor was under Su Yu's command!

The Hundred Battle King was shocked!

Looking again, he was even more surprised, "Which month?"

As for which month... it was hard to tell.

But the opponent must be one of the months, from the Iron Devourer Race!

And also third-tier!

The one using the power of stars was also third-tier, who was it?

March and the Undead Emperor didn't use the power of their worlds, but before Su Yu left, he filled everyone's Great Dao with the power of laws, so their strength didn't decline much, and the Martial Emperor was unaffected.

At this moment, the three top-tier experts joined forces, forcing the Hundred Battle King to retreat repeatedly.

The Hundred Battle King roared, a long blade in hand, also astonished.

Under Su Yu's command, there were actually three top-tier experts!

Damn!

This was much stronger than I expected!

In his mind, Su Yu's side might not even have a third-tier, probably fourth or fifth-tier, but suddenly, three appeared!

"Hmph!"

Though surprised, the Hundred Battle King was not afraid, sneering, "Just the three of you? What can you do to me? If I don't show you some real skills, you'll think we've wasted these years. Watch me cut off your tongues and let you know the consequences of speaking recklessly..."

The four top-tier experts instantly clashed together!

Chapter 1: The Battle of Titans

The clash between the Hundred Battle King and the Martial Emperor was fierce. As the Hundred Battle King charged at the Martial Emperor, he taunted, "You, the defeated subordinate of the Martial King, dare to challenge me now?"

The Martial Emperor's expression darkened. "You think you can provoke me?" he retorted. His body swelled with power, and with a thunderous roar, he charged, forcing the Hundred Battle King to stagger back. A long spear appeared in his hand, and he gritted his teeth. "You've angered me, you little fatty. If I don't beat you today, I'll never forgive myself!"

With a mighty sweep, the spear clashed against a long blade. At that moment, March seized the opportunity, striking down with a bamboo staff. The Hundred Battle King felt a sudden sense of dread. What was this strange feeling?

Before he could recover, the Undead Emperor summoned countless stars to encircle the Hundred Battle King. With a deafening crash, the stars collided, forcing him to retreat continuously.

Despite his strength, the Hundred Battle King found himself at a disadvantage. Without using the power of laws beyond the realm of a ruler, the three-on-one battle only slightly favored his opponents. It was worth noting that these three were among the strongest under Su Yu's command.

Yet, the Hundred Battle King was not the strongest under the Human Emperor; the Radiant King was still around. Su Yu observed the battle with a slight raise of his brow. Not weak, he thought. In fact, quite strong. Without the augmentation of the power of the heavens and earth, Su Yu estimated that he was about equal to the Hundred Battle King, perhaps even slightly weaker.

Of course, this wasn't a life-and-death struggle, so the outcome was uncertain. Nevertheless, the strength of the Hundred Battle King was enough to make Su Yu serious. A single Hundred Battle King nearly suppressed everyone on this side, yet such a being wasn't even the pinnacle under the Human Emperor. Meanwhile, the Human Emperor's side was heavily suppressed by the myriad races, indicating that there were likely many second-tier beings and possibly some first-tier ones as well.

Su Yu was alarmed. The Hundred Battle King, too, was surprised by the strength of his opponents. With the Martial Emperor present, it was expected. The Martial Emperor had been stronger than him in the past, only sealed for years. Otherwise, the Martial Emperor could have easily overpowered him back then. But the fact that the Martial Emperor had been subdued by Su Yu was the most shocking revelation.

The four-way battle continued, with the Hundred Battle King slightly suppressed. March's bamboo staff, in particular, seemed to have a suppressive effect on him, much to his surprise. What was this thing? It felt oppressive.

That was the weapon of the Human Ancestor!

March hadn't even dared to unleash its full power due to the potential commotion. Even so, each strike with the bamboo staff left the Hundred Battle King somewhat uncomfortable.

As the battle raged on, the Hundred Battle King's eyes flickered. He glanced at Su Yu's side, noticing the number of people present. Suddenly, he slashed at March, forcing him back, and sneered, "Su Human Lord, are your subordinates just these old relics and outsiders?"

"So, it's still the foundation we left behind, isn't it?"

Su Yu chuckled. Initially, he had only intended for the three of them to give the Hundred Battle King a beating. But now, it seemed the Hundred Battle King wanted to test the waters further.

Su Yu smiled and said lightly, "Wan Tiansheng, the Hundred Battle King seems to look down on those of you who have risen in the post-ancient era. Go and spar with him!"

In an instant, many leaped out.

Wan Tiansheng, the Great Ming King, Xia Longwu, and Yingwu all jumped out.

Su Yu smiled again, "Hundred Battle King, do you consider the ancient marquises old? If so, I won't let them take action..."

The Hundred Battle King was taken aback, then laughed, "I'm a king, they're marquises, all my grandsons. Come on, all of you!"

At this moment, Giant Axe, Red Moon, and Wu Ji were stunned.

Why are you insulting us? We didn't provoke you!

At this moment, Su Yu's voice rang out, "Since the senior wants to experience your skills, go ahead. Humans, go. Non-humans, just watch. Martial Emperor, you all retreat for now."

And at this moment, many more people stepped forward!

There were indeed quite a few ancient marquises.

Among the humans, Red Moon, Blood Shadow, Yingwu, Xuelan, Lanshan...

A group of humans!

The Hundred Battle King was stunned. So many?

If they all came at him, it wouldn't work!

They couldn't all be rulers of laws, could they?

Boom!

Without thinking, a blade slashed towards him. Xia Longwu, full of excitement, or rather, fervor, shouted, "Junior, let me learn from your blade techniques! With respect!"

He didn't mention his identity, fearing the Hundred Battle King would use it against him.

Fight first, talk later!

Xia Longwu was a martial fanatic. Not many humans used blades. His grandfather did, but it wasn't easy to spar with him. Now... the Hundred Battle King was separated by countless generations. Fight first, talk later!

Boom!

A blade slashed down, and the next moment, the Great Qin King laughed, "Let me learn from your spear!"

"I'll set up a formation, he won't escape, everyone, fight without worry!"

The Great Ming King's laughter echoed.

In the blink of an eye, many strong individuals charged forward together!

Boom!

The Hundred Battle King was indeed strong, but at this moment, he was still stunned. Astonished, he exclaimed, "Are you all rulers of laws?"

So many!

Not just one or two, but many, all of them!

"Nanxi, Red Moon... you've all become rulers of laws..."

The Hundred Battle King shouldn't have spoken. As soon as he did, everyone felt he was looking down on them.

Fine, let's beat you up!

Su Yu's side might not have many new-generation humans, but the old generation wasn't lacking. There were five who had defected from Hundred Battle's side, plus Lanshan and others, totaling over ten rulers of laws!

In the blink of an eye, more than ten rulers of laws surrounded the Hundred Battle King, attacking him fiercely!

Some people didn't step forward.

For example, Wan Tiansheng stood at the back of the crowd, using a faint power of the great dao, smiling. Inside, the besieged Hundred Battle King suddenly laughed.

His laughter was somewhat unnatural!

Why am I laughing?

No, someone is controlling me!

Just as he thought this, he was instantly petrified!

Boom!

Thunder struck down!

The West King's Consort and Hetu also joined the fray!

The Hundred Battle King wanted to break out of the encirclement, but Wu Ji and other strong physical fighters closed in, forcing him back with sheer force.

At this moment, there was no need for Su Yu to command; they were all strong individuals.

The Great Qin King, Xia Longwu, and Wu Ji were in the inner circle, acting as shields. On the outer circle, control and support specialists attacked, pressing the Hundred Battle King hard!

No matter how strong he was, he was only second-tier!

Fighting ten or more alone, he couldn't manage it, especially since not all were fourth or fifth-tier. Su Yu's side almost had no fifth-tier!

For Su Yu, fifth-tier combat power was rarely treated as a ruler of laws!

This time, the Hundred Battle King suffered.

With a thud, the Great Qin King's spearhead disappeared, turning into a stick that struck his arm. Wu Ji engaged in close combat, locking one of his arms in an instant. Xia Longwu's blade slashed, knocking the long blade from the Hundred Battle King's hand.

The others joined in, and in a blink, the Hundred Battle King shouted, "Stop being so presumptuous... are you all rulers of laws?"

He was utterly shocked!

So many?

Hadn't the myriad realms not produced rulers of laws for so many years?

The Hundred Battle King roared, "We're all humans, I don't want to hurt you... boo hoo... pfft, you in the green robe, what are you doing... hahaha... boo hoo..."

The Hundred Battle King suddenly felt both joy and anger!

Outside, Wan Tiansheng controlled him, manipulating his emotions, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness!

Wan Tiansheng, who mastered the seven emotions and six desires, was indeed terrifying!

At this moment, Su Yu didn't record the scene, but Heavendoom, acting like a lackey, eagerly took out a recording talisman to capture it!

And Su Yu, with a smile on his face.

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King was truly outmatched, his eyes blackened from the beating, and he roared, "Don't go too far! I'm your senior... we're all humans, if not, I'd kill one with a single slash..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Heavendoom, it seems the Hundred Battle King has learned the might of humans. Chaos Dragon, Eight-Winged Tiger, Hou Emperor... your turn!"

In an instant, the Great Ming King and others quickly retreated.

The Hundred Battle King hadn't even had time to catch his breath when his face changed, "No way!"

They couldn't all be rulers of laws!

I don't believe it!

No matter how many there are, I'm not afraid!

If they were all Daofuse, I'd take them down one by one...

Boom!

He punched the seemingly clumsy Chaos Dragon, only to feel his body tremble and stagger back, shocked, "Damn!"

What was this?

A true physical powerhouse of the Chaos Race!

Was this... third-tier?

The Chaos Race, known for their physical strength, was this dragon from the Chaos Race?

Moreover, it seemed to be a third-tier existence!

The Chaos Dragon flicked its tail disdainfully. The Hundred Battle King was strong, but not a physical dao practitioner. Strictly speaking, his physical strength might not surpass the dragon's. At this moment, the dragon lashed out with its tail!

Taking advantage of the opportunity to fight, the dragon decided to give the Hundred Battle King a good beating!

The Hundred Battle King was alarmed. Damn, another third-tier?

How many rulers of laws were there?

Before he could recover, Heavendoom laughed and swung a club at him. The Hundred Battle King was annoyed by this big monkey and was about to retaliate when a massive mountain peak descended. Hongmeng apologized, "Hundred Battle King, forgive me!"

"Hongmeng?"

Boom!

At this time, the Eight-Winged Tiger and others joined in, as did Lie Kong and other strong individuals. Even Doubao joined in, and before the Hundred Battle King, the image of the Culture King appeared, conjured by Doubao!

The Hundred Battle King was momentarily stunned, and with a thud, the Chaos Dragon's tail struck again!

In a one-on-one, the Hundred Battle King would surely win.

The problem was, there were too many people!

He had made a bold statement, and now, in the blink of an eye, he was besieged and battered, wanting to escape but finding himself locked in. Marquis Tongtian and Lie Kong exchanged glances and laughed.

One sealed the space, the other sealed the portal.

Not only that, but just as the Hundred Battle King was about to punch Doubao, Doubao vanished, transforming into the Chaos Dragon, which clawed at him!

"Tongtian?"

The Hundred Battle King was shocked; it was Tongtian's space conversion!

And Marquis Tongtian laughed, "Hundred Battle King, sorry, my boss is no longer the Human Emperor, but Emperor Yu... prepare to be beaten!"

Boom!

The Hundred Battle King had just been clawed back by the Chaos Dragon, and behind him, five or six strong individuals appeared. As he turned to strike, they disappeared, reappearing above him!

Boom!

Heavendoom was having a blast, swinging his club and causing the Hundred Battle King to stagger. This guy put away his club and punched the Hundred Battle King in the eye!

Already black and blue, his eye turned even darker!

The Battle King wanted to retaliate, but every time he tried, his moves were anticipated. On the periphery, Destiny and the Fate Emperor both opened their eyes, continuously transmitting information to Tongtian, predicting his actions!

Observing the aura!

Every attack path of the Battle King was seen through by these two, and the information was instantly relayed to Tongtian. Tongtian would then quickly redirect the attack towards stronger opponents like the Chaos Dragon or the Eight-Winged Tiger.

All of them had powerful physical bodies!

September and the others were mere targets, but Tongtian also sent some people around him to deal with the Battle King.

Boom!

A series of loud explosions echoed, and moments later, a desperate scream rang out, "Damn it, this is too much! I surrender! Stop hitting me!"

This is too much!

So many people ganging up on me, it's too much!

They're all rulers of laws!

Ah!

All of them!

The Battle King felt both angry and delighted!

Angry because of his misfortune, getting beaten by over thirty rulers of laws without realizing it; delighted because, my heavens, over thirty of them!

Oh my!

At this moment, the Battle King's delight overshadowed his anger.

Su Yu... brought over thirty rulers of laws!

Unbelievable, unimaginable!

He was completely stunned!

Su Yu didn't just bring a few minor figures; he brought a group of rulers of laws strong enough to rival the current human powerhouses, provided you exclude a few top figures.

Excluding the Human Emperor, Radiant King, and the Battle King, the rest were roughly equivalent to Su Yu's side in strength!

Inconceivable!

So many of them!

The Battle King found it hard to imagine, while Su Yu smiled and said, "Alright, everyone, step back!"

In that instant, the thirty-plus rulers of laws around them dispersed.

The Battle King, bruised and battered, couldn't care less about his appearance as he looked at Su Yu with a mix of astonishment and amusement.

"Lord Su... this..."

He couldn't believe it!

Where did so many rulers of laws come from?

Su Yu chuckled softly, "Battle King, just a little joke, hope you don't mind?"

"Not at all, not at all!"

The Battle King quickly waved his hand, still in shock!

They were all rulers of laws!

At this moment, Su Yu said, "Xingyue, heal the Battle King!"

Behind the Battle King, Xingyue stepped forward, her life force emanating as she healed him. While doing so, she curiously remarked, "So many now?"

There weren't this many before!

Su Yu laughed, "It's alright, I left a few at home to guard the house, just in case! By the way, Battle King, you mentioned that it was fine for the humans to hit you... Xingyue is also one of mine, and she didn't hit you, which surprised me a bit..."

The Battle King was taken aback, what do you mean, one of yours?

Nonsense!

This is the sister of the Emperor, how did she become yours?

Xingyue hesitated for a moment, then suddenly punched the Battle King, leaving him a bit dazed. Seeing his bewildered expression, Xingyue whispered, "I walked his Life and Death Path, this... counts as a pledge of allegiance?"

Su Yu has so many under his command, Battle King, don't mind me, I'm just giving you a punch as a token of allegiance!

The Battle King was dumbfounded!

He just remembered that Xingyue... was indeed revived by Su Yu!

This... indeed walked Su Yu's Life and Death Path, my heavens, does this mean our doctor is considered one of Su Yu's people?

Su Yu chuckled, "Just a joke, Xingyue took it seriously, Battle King, sorry, I just like to joke around!"

The Battle King grinned, though inwardly he was shocked!

Su Yu didn't even make a move!

Actually, that's not the point.

The key is, he's a young man, seemingly only in his twenties, yet he has subdued so many rulers of laws, including humans, myriad races, and even the Chaos Ancient Clan. This guy... a white-robed cultivator!

Suddenly, he felt a chill.

This guy is extraordinary!

Absolutely extraordinary!

At this point, anyone who thinks he's ordinary must be a fool!

The Battle King felt both heavy-hearted and joyful.

Joyful because so many powerhouses had come to support them!

Heavy-hearted because this Su Yu doesn't seem easy to deal with!

Bringing so many people, will there be any conflict with the Human Emperor?

To be able to subdue so many powerhouses in the myriad realms, if the Battle King still thought Su Yu was easy to deal with, he'd be a fool. He just feared this guy might have too much ambition and try to take over!

That's his biggest concern!

Otherwise, seeing so many powerhouses, he should be ecstatic!

Xingyue...

The Battle King glanced at Xingyue, his mind racing with thoughts. Xingyue's fate... seems to be in Su Yu's hands too!

At this moment, he quickly put on a smile and laughed heartily, "Lord Su, you're too kind, it's nothing, just a small matter! Just joking with everyone, I was joking too, on the front lines, the pressure from the myriad races is too great. Seeing comrades arrive, my mood improved, and I just wanted to joke with everyone..."

He appeared very sincere at this moment!

His mind was racing with thoughts, but his face showed nothing, and at this moment, among the crowd, Xia Longwu slightly bowed, "Forgive my rudeness! Senior, I am Xia Longwu of the Great Xia Prefecture, Xia family..."

The Battle King was stunned, taking a deep breath, and soon his mouth twitched, damn it!

The guy who was crazily slashing at me just now... could be... my descendant?

"Xia Longwu..."

The Battle King hesitated slightly, "You..."

At this moment, a surge of bloodline power erupted from Xia Longwu's body, and the Battle King was stunned, really my descendant, damn it!

Previously, Xia Longwu deliberately concealed it to avoid being discovered by him, but this time... it was confirmed!

Really from my family!

The Battle King was momentarily speechless, damn it, you know I'm your ancestor, yet you slashed at me so fiercely?

Xia Longwu looked serious, not overly polite, but still respectful. After all, he's an ancestor... during festivals, they would pay respects, though whether the Battle King received them was another matter!

Too many generations apart!

Now, seeing the ancestor, his feelings were neither complicated nor uncomplicated, just felt... the ancestor got beaten up pretty badly!

Thirty-six powerhouses, thirty-five participated, beating the ancestor until he cried... Wan Tiansheng's contribution, this will all be recorded, the ancestor might not feel it now, but he will know later, and it will be quite tragic!

At this moment, the Battle King looked at Xia Longwu while thinking, and soon, with a bright smile, he said, "Lord Su, His Majesty the Human Emperor sent me to temporarily receive everyone, the front line is too tense... everyone settle here for a while... I'll go report to His Majesty, see if he can spare some time to personally meet with Lord Su..."

At this moment, the Battle King chose not to chat much with Su Yu.

It was different from what he expected!

He couldn't make decisions on this matter, and Su Yu and his group couldn't be taken there rashly.

This matter must be reported to the Human Emperor!

It's not just one or two, but a full thirty-six powerhouses!

There are even second-tier ones!

A few third-tier ones, and the weakest seem to be fourth-tier!

As for Su Yu himself... most likely... maybe... perhaps... reached second-tier, which the Battle King dared not imagine, as it would be too terrifying, a young man in his twenties, second-tier!

But the Martial Emperor, such an unruly character, was subdued, clearly indicating that Su Yu isn't weak!

If he were weak, the Martial Emperor would have rebelled long ago!

The Battle King's mind was agile, smiling as he said, "Sister Xingyue, entertain Lord Su and his group, Lord Su and Sister Xingyue are familiar... she is His Majesty's sister, the closest and most favored... everyone chat more... rest here for a while, I'll be back soon!"

Su Yu smiled, "Then take your time, Battle King. Regarding our matters, I think you should discuss with the Human Emperor first, don't spread it rashly, lest the myriad races find out!"

"Of course, of course!"

The Battle King smiled, bid farewell, and then hurriedly ran back!

Something big happened!

Your Majesty, this Su Yu, is not simple!

...

Su Yu chuckled.

The others also laughed, while Xingyue didn't care much about these things, looking at Su Yu and his group, still puzzled, "Why so many rulers of laws, you didn't inform me!"

Too much!

Su Yu laughed, "Couldn't explain it through messages, seeing is believing, Lord Xingyue, nothing major happened recently, right?"

"No, everything's fine."

Xingyue shook her head, and Su Yu smiled, that's good, though it seems the Human Emperor didn't accept Xingyue's treatment, which isn't a good thing!

...

Meanwhile.

The Battle King quickly recovered from his injuries, just superficial wounds, nothing serious for him.

He was somewhat solemn, quickly running back, just as the Radiant King was there, seeing him, he shouted, "Why are you running so fast, where did you go just now, your clothes are torn, what were you doing?"

The Battle King was very solemn, transmitting, "Come with me to see His Majesty!"

The Radiant King was taken aback, what's going on?

But he quickly followed, asking as they walked, "There seemed to be some fighting sounds from the rear just now, I seemed to sense some familiar auras..."

That might be your grandson's grandson coming!

The one setting up the formation might be the Radiant King's descendant, the Battle King speculated for a moment but said nothing more.

Soon, they reached where the Human Emperor was.

The Human Emperor's shadow still shone across the heavens.

Seeing them, he was a bit surprised, why did the Battle King return?

And the Battle King, at this moment, with a heavy expression, said, "Your Majesty! Something big happened!"

"......"

The Human Emperor smiled, "Is it related to Su Yu?"

The Battle King thought for a moment, then suddenly said, "Ahem, the Martial Emperor... he has been revived!"

First, lighten the mood, lest His Majesty gets too tense!

The Human Emperor was taken aback, then... speechless!

Damn you!

At this time, you're nervously telling me this, you boring guy!

The Radiant King was also taken aback, then laughed heartily, "No way! Your Majesty... this... hahaha..."

Laughing, he suddenly paused, "Did Su Yu and his group arrive? Could it be... the Martial Emperor is among them?"

Smart!

The Battle King secretly praised, seeing them still considering the Martial Emperor, he lightly coughed and said, "Well... also, not only did Su Yu come, but including himself, a total of 36 people came!"

"And not all are humans, there are some allied races too..."

War King spoke, noticing that the two seemed to still be pondering over the Martial Emperor, he said dryly, "Um... Your Majesty, their strength is not weak!"

The Human Emperor chuckled, "The Martial Emperor is here? That's somewhat unexpected. But Su Yu, can he suppress him?"

"He can!" War King replied decisively.

Seeing the surprise on the faces of the Human Emperor and the Radiant King, he added dryly, "They... all 36 of them... are rulers of laws!"

Boom!

The aura of the Radiant King erupted instantly. The next moment, he suddenly roared, "Those bastards on the other side, come out and fight! I've had enough of you! Your Majesty, let's go all out! Something seems to have happened in the Myriad Realms!"

"......"

From the opposite continent, a grand and cold laughter echoed, "Something happened? It seems... your perception has weakened! Human Emperor, withdraw early, return to the Myriad Realms!"

The Radiant King cursed angrily, "Damn your ancestors, get lost, I was just saying! Your Majesty, let's not fight, let's outlast them!"

"......"

Soon, both sides fell silent.

The Radiant King, not taking it seriously, just shouted a few words to suppress his surprise. At this moment, he looked shocked, "All 36 of them?"

"Yes!" War King bared his teeth, "Too many! I didn't know at first and suffered a bit. The Martial Emperor has stepped into the second tier, and Su Yu suppressed the Martial Emperor... I think... he might also be second tier! There are several in the third tier, and the rest are almost all fourth tier, with seemingly no fifth tier!"

This time, even the Human Emperor's phantom trembled slightly!

36 of them!

"Not only that, there are still some who haven't come..."

The Human Emperor suddenly asked, "Did Zhou Tian... come?"

"No!" War King shook his head, "Didn't see him!"

The Human Emperor instantly fell into deep thought, his heart also filled with shock. 36 of them! Zhou Tian didn't come! That means these people weren't cultivated by Zhou Tian.

What's going on?

I didn't sense much... doesn't that mean they might be rulers of laws cultivated within Su Yu's own world!

At this moment, even he had to take a deep breath!

War King, seeing the Human Emperor's phantom trembling, said dryly, "Your Majesty, the Martial Emperor isn't dead, um, let's continue to be shocked by this news, don't be too tense..."

The Human Emperor was speechless!

Do I need your comfort?

What am I tense about!

I'm just surprised!

Surprised by Su Yu's incredibility!

How is this possible!

The next moment, the Human Emperor's phantom trembled slightly, and suddenly, a small shadow appeared. The Human Emperor's voice came, "I can't leave this projection... I'll split another avatar to go meet Su Yu! Radiant King, you also create a character avatar, War King... take us to meet Su Yu!"

This time, he wasn't letting War King go alone.

He wanted to personally go and talk to Su Yu!

36 rulers of laws, all at once, had shaken the Human Emperor.

An opportunity!

And also a crisis!

If it were during his peak, with so many people coming to aid, he would dare to forcibly attack the Myriad Races now!

But... now is not the time.

He felt a bit regretful, a pity, missing the opportunity, otherwise, this would have been the battle to turn the tables!

Too bad!

At this moment, the Human Emperor was filled with regret, but also very excited.

I've waited for years, and finally, the opportunity has come!

Su Yu... this brat... ahem, this tenth generation Human Lord, has done well!

"I originally wanted to kill this brat... now it seems... it's not easy to make a move!"

At this time, War King suddenly thought of something and reminded, "Your Majesty, the one in the white robe, always smiling, I thought the Culture King had returned, but at a glance, he's not a good person!"

"Hiss!"

The Radiant King took a breath, "Not easy to provoke! A white robe with over 30 rulers of laws... tsk tsk, troublesome!"

Normally, a white robe isn't scary, but combined with Su Yu's strength and identity, indeed, not easy to provoke!

The Human Emperor was also stunned, another Culture King?

Well... it's not impossible to deal with!

Didn't I deal with the Culture King?

"Let's go, take a look!"

His phantom entered War King's body, and the Radiant King also split a character, they had to meet this white-robed Human Lord!
