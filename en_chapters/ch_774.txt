Chapter 774: Kings Do Not Meet (10,000 Words Requesting Subscription)

Walking on the land of the Human Realm, a group of people followed behind him. Hundred Battle could no longer find the feeling he once had. He could feel that the Human Realm was now rejecting him.

Among the 36 prefects present, he could sense their emotions—resentment, indifference, unwillingness, and anger. These people were too weak. Their emotional fluctuations couldn't escape Hundred Battle's notice. Perhaps they were angry, wondering why he had returned. Six thousand years ago, wasn't he sealed? Wasn't he already dead? Now, the Human Realm has a new Human Lord, so why return?

Not only did Hundred Battle feel this, but those around him did too. They were not weak, so they could naturally sense these emotions and even faintly hear discussions from afar. Some were saying, "Why is this new Human Lord coming back after all these years? Wasn't he dead?"

As the strongest under Hundred Battle, Marquis Nanxi heard this. His expression was complex, and he suddenly said, "Your Majesty, they are just ignorant people. Please do not mind them! They know nothing. If we could have won back then, things wouldn't have come to this."

"Precisely because we couldn't win and didn't want to doom the entire human race, we chose this path!" Marquis Nanxi's face was complicated as he looked at Xia Huyou and the others beside him. He hesitated for a moment but still spoke up to defend Hundred Battle, "If we could have defeated the myriad races and the Control King's lineage back then, we wouldn't have chosen this! Perhaps... you have guessed something, but if we hadn't preserved the spark back then, the entire human race might have been wiped out with our defeat!"

He was somewhat unwilling, as he received no response. He continued, "The Human Realm seems difficult, but in reality, His Majesty has always been watching and caring. If not, how would there be an invitation from Zhou Tian, or the Ancient Giant King coming to aid us?"

Marquis Yunshui had also mentioned this. Marquis Nanxi said solemnly, "The Ancient Giant King is willing to help because of His Majesty. Otherwise, why would he get involved in this mess?"

Xia Huyou smiled broadly and nodded, "Marquis Nanxi is right. We all understand!"

Marquis Nanxi frowned, knowing this was just perfunctory. Yet, he was truly unwilling. If he were truly indifferent, it would show he didn't care about the opinions of these weaklings. But at this moment, he did care!

Marquis Nanxi said in a low voice, "You are the descendant of the Battle King. Since you became the prefect of this region at such a young age, I heard you are also a friend of Su Yu..."

Xia Huyou chuckled, "Senior, I've heard... just heard, that you were saved by Emperor Yu! At the cost of killing the Heavenly King, he saved you. Although you are older, you are still our elder... However, Emperor Yu is the master of the Tenth Tide, and you call him by name... In the Upper Realm, it seems you have some interactions with His Majesty. Is this appropriate?"

Marquis Nanxi was slightly taken aback, feeling complex, and remained silent.

Beside him, Marquis Jiang Hai said coldly, "Do you know who you are talking to? Even in the Ancient Era, your ancestor, the Battle King..."

Xia Huyou smiled and nodded, not waiting for him to finish, sincerely saying, "Yes, my ancestor, the Battle King, wouldn't dare speak to everyone like this. He would bow and call everyone grandfather!"

Silence!

Absolute silence!

Ahead, Hundred Battle, who was looking around, did not turn back but chuckled, "Alright, let's lighten the mood. No need for such deep resentment! Jiang Hai, say less."

"Your Majesty!"

Marquis Jiang Hai was somewhat annoyed. He was a direct descendant of the Battle King and different from the others. Now, these people seemed to reject them, which made him a bit angry. His Majesty's return would only benefit the human race. How could it harm them? His Majesty, during his reign, loved the people like his children!

During the Ninth Tide, which human didn't praise His Majesty's wisdom? It was heartfelt! Even the Great Zhou King often said that Hundred Battle might have wronged the allied races, but he never wronged the human race. Of course, the final battle of the Ninth Tide was another matter.

Xia Huyou smiled and didn't continue. What if he got cut down? Too weak. However, Marquis Nanxi called him by name, so he said something in return. You owe Su Yu a life, so you must show respect!

Marquis Nanxi felt complex and sighed, "Perhaps you are right. Indeed, he saved me."

Marquis Jiang Hai frowned and said in a low voice, "Wrong. If he hadn't caused trouble in the Upper Realm, would the myriad races have searched the Source of the Dao? Nanxi, do you think we owe him? No, we don't owe him! If he hadn't gone to the Upper Realm, would there have been a change in the Source of the Dao?"

He didn't feel they owed Su Yu! They were in seclusion, and the myriad races suddenly swept through. Wasn't this all Su Yu's doing?

Marquis Nanxi remained silent. Beside him, Marquis Zhennan frowned slightly and said, "Jiang Hai, enough! You've just returned to the Human Realm, and His Majesty is tired. Why not rest for a while and then meet the strong ones from each prefecture and city? The Emperor Yu's residence... ahem, before Su Yu left, he didn't take the residence he built. His Majesty can stay there temporarily."

Hundred Battle nodded slightly and smiled, "Let's go there. Zhennan, your physical injuries are severe. When we return, I'll help you recover. Perhaps you'll have a chance to step into the quasi-king realm."

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Marquis Zhennan bowed slightly. Hundred Battle looked at Wen Qi beside him and smiled, "Wen Qi has also reached Daofuse. Not bad!"

"Thanks to Your Majesty's blessings!"

"You... still like to say these flattering words, just like before."

Hundred Battle chuckled, then looked up at the sky. After a long pause, he said, "I'll see if I can save Shadow and Mist Mountain. If I can, we'll almost be complete!"

As for the rest, they were not here. Hundred Battle said no more. As he walked towards the Emperor Yu's residence, he asked, "Your name is Xia Huyou, right?"

"Yes, Human Lord, do you have any orders?"

Xia Huyou smiled brightly, quickly catching up, his smile radiant.

"I heard you have a good relationship with Su Yu?"

Xia Huyou smiled, "Just so-so. He's high above, and I'm just a small figure. Don't misunderstand, Human Lord."

"Sly!"

Hundred Battle laughed, "Don't worry. I don't intend to do anything to you! Whether it's rejection, anger, or resentment, in truth... this Human Lord, since I left six thousand years ago, is just a thing of the past! Of course, I have no ill will towards the human race. We share the same roots!"

"Su Yu left because he didn't want to be under me, and I... didn't want to serve him. We each have our choices!"

As he walked, Hundred Battle said, "Now is not the time for internal strife between him and me. Perhaps our ideals differ, our thoughts differ, even our doctrines differ! But... we are still human!"

He continued, "Whether it's the Primordial Era or the Ancient Era, we are all human! In truth, the Primordial and Ancient Eras were never disconnected; they have always been one, just in succession! And the Control King, who sided with chaos... if we must speak of human traitors, it is the Control King's lineage!"

He said solemnly, "I may have erred, but I have never betrayed! The Primordial and Ancient Eras are one era! After that, we are all human!"

He didn't have to explain. These people were too weak, merely in the Sunmoon Realm. Yet, he explained anyway. Seeing the Human Realm again, feeling so different from before, he felt perhaps he should say a few words. He and Su Yu, perhaps he represented the Primordial Era, while Su Yu represented the Ancient Era. But essentially, there wasn't much difference. Whether it's the Human Ancestor or the Human Emperor, they are all from the same era!

This era hasn't ended completely. Behind the Control King's lineage, they are no longer human.

Xia Huyou nodded with a smile, "The Human Lord is right. Emperor Yu also said this before he left. He said that the Human Lord's return would not harm the human race! He trusted the Human Lord. Otherwise, based on what I know of him, he wouldn't have left the Human Realm. If the Control King's lineage or the myriad races attacked, he would fight to the death here. He wouldn't abandon the Human Realm!"

This was indeed Su Yu's thought. Xia Huyou knew Su Yu's mind. Su Yu believed that Hundred Battle wouldn't harm the human race. Otherwise, he wouldn't have left so easily. This was also the tacit understanding between Su Yu and Hundred Battle, even though they hadn't met. Whether you cultivate your confidants or direct descendants, it doesn't matter. The human race is still the human race. Essentially, we are all human. There is no betrayal of this race!

It's just that there are differences in ideology. Su Yu doesn't agree with Hundred Battle, and Hundred Battle may not agree with Su Yu.

Hundred Battle also smiled, "What you say is true. In that case, I should be happy! These are not important matters! Now, many things are urgent! Including the return of the Human Emperor and others, the Myriad Realms will be in chaos! This is not the most terrifying thing. The terrifying thing is that the existence behind the Gate of Hell may break through!"

Hundred Battle sighed, "In fact, I knew some things back then. Knowing more made me feel helpless, even a bit desperate... In the end, I had to choose another path!"

Xia Huyou knew some of this, though not in detail. At this moment, he cautiously asked, "Then why didn't the Human Lord take a gamble back then? Perhaps... there was hope! Now, after sealing yourself for six thousand years, your strength is still the same. If your strength hasn't changed, wouldn't these six thousand years have been wasted?"

Marquis Nanxi and the others had strange expressions. Was this blatant intelligence gathering?

Hundred Battle laughed, "Of course, my strength has changed! Six thousand years, having made a choice, how could there be no change? Otherwise, as you said, wouldn't six thousand years have been wasted? These six thousand years have been a period of accumulation!"

Xia Huyou's round face broke into a smile, "Then the Human Lord must have many Heavenly Sovereigns now? Then the human race is strong. With the Human Lord, it's the fortune of the human race!"

Hundred Battle chuckled. Beside him, Marquis Nanxi also coughed lightly. It was just short of directly asking how many Heavenly Sovereigns there were.

Hundred Battle chuckled, "To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how many Heavenly Sovereigns there are! Six thousand years ago, I left some people behind to continuously comprehend the Dao, even hiding within it. There might be some changes. If we're lucky, maybe five or six will emerge. If not... well, I can't say."

"Five or six?" Xia Huyou quickly jotted it down. There was no reason for Hundred Battle to deceive him on this matter. It seemed Hundred Battle also wanted him to relay this to Su Yu.

At this moment, Xia Huyou felt that being friends with Su Yu wasn't such a bad thing. Perhaps Hundred Battle knew this, and considering Xia Huyou was the descendant of the Battle King, Hundred Battle treated him with a certain level of respect.

Xia Huyou hurriedly asked, "Does the Human Lord think we can defeat the Myriad Races and the Control King's lineage?"

"There is hope!" Hundred Battle nodded. "But ideally, both sides should suffer significant losses. Otherwise, even if we win, it would be a pyrrhic victory! Even if the Human Emperor returns... the situation won't necessarily improve; it might even worsen!"

"Don't pin your hopes on the Human Emperor's return to improve the situation!"

Hundred Battle spoke gravely, "First, the Human Race's previous rulers of laws were fewer than the Myriad Races! Over the years, perhaps we've suffered greater losses, and the Myriad Races definitely hold the advantage! Second, the Gate of Hell might soon open... and perhaps other places too! At that time, it will be the worst era for the Human Race!"

"So if we are to win, it cannot be a pyrrhic victory. If it is, we're finished!"

"Even if a ruler of laws is to be born, it must be from the Human Race, and we must support their emergence!"

Hearing this, Xia Huyou's heart stirred. Could the return of the Human Emperor be a bad thing? Perhaps... it was indeed so! Su Yu had vaguely mentioned something similar. If the Human Emperor held the advantage, he would have returned long ago. The delay in returning might indicate a bigger problem.

In this regard, Hundred Battle and Su Yu shared the same thought.

"So... do we have any hope at all?"

"Of course!" Hundred Battle smiled. "If there was none, why would I come out of retirement? Some things don't need to be said too much. In time, you'll naturally understand!"

Xia Huyou nodded. At this moment, he felt that Hundred Battle wasn't so bad... perhaps. But then again, who made him acquainted with Su Yu? Who made Su Yu the master of this era?

Soon, the group arrived at the Luminous Domain Mansion. Looking at its grandeur, Hundred Battle smiled but said nothing. Jiang Hai Marquis, however, frowned slightly, "Such extravagance! Back when His Majesty inherited the position of Human Lord, he never constructed such a grand palace!"

It was indeed quite extravagant! This Luminous Domain Mansion was built by Zhu Tiandao and Marquis Xia. The two spared no expense to curry favor, especially since they had just defeated the Myriad Races and were attacking the Myriad Realms, bringing back all sorts of treasures. They even dismantled many palaces of the Myriad Races just for a piece of wood or a brick.

Xia Huyou chuckled, "Senior, you misunderstand. This is nothing! Emperor Yu led us to defeat the Myriad Races and conquer the Myriad Realms! Except for the God, Demon, and Immortal Races, everything else is ours for the taking! It's just a palace, nothing worth mentioning!"

If you have the ability, conquer the Myriad Realms yourself! Once you've done that, you can even change the Heavenly Court, and no one will stop you!

Jiang Hai wanted to say more, but Hundred Battle raised his hand, smiling, "Indeed, it's quite an achievement to conquer the Myriad Realms. It's a legacy that will be remembered for ages!"

"Your Majesty!" Jiang Hai Marquis said in a low voice, "If it weren't for Your Majesty back then... the lower realm wouldn't have only this few Daofuse experts! Saying we defeated the Myriad Realms is an exaggeration. In reality, it's just a few dozen Daofuse experts, hardly worth mentioning!"

Xia Huyou remained silent, merely smiling without a word. Perhaps so! Some of the other prefects sneered internally, while others lowered their heads, not looking.

Hardly worth mentioning? If it's so insignificant, why haven't you conquered the Myriad Realms? Yes, there are only a few dozen Daofuse experts, and the lower realm doesn't have many. But think about it, what was the starting point for the Human Race? Not a single Daofuse expert! It's not about comparing strength but about the disparity in power. A ruler of laws defeating an Eternal isn't a miracle! But a Sunmoon defeating an Eternal is something worth remembering!

Hundred Battle didn't want to dwell on this, cutting off Jiang Hai Marquis. Soon, the group entered the Luminous Domain Mansion. Inside, after a brief conversation, Hundred Battle said, "I'll go find Shadow and Mist Mountain first, see if I can bring them back! Everything else remains the same!"

He had no intention of changing any rules in the Human Realm, nor did he want to bother with it. Since the Human Realm was peaceful, why change anything?

Hundred Battle was decisive. After speaking, he tore through the River of Time and vanished from the Luminous Domain Mansion. As he left, he said, "For now, the affairs of the Human Realm will be managed by Marquis Nanxi and Marquis Zhennan, with Xia Huyou assisting. Everyone else, follow their orders!"

He didn't let Jiang Hai manage affairs, as it would likely cause trouble. Nor did he let Marquis Yunshui manage, as many were resistant due to previous encounters with Human Race experts. They remembered seeing Marquis Yunshui under Su Yu's command.

Upon hearing this, Xia Huyou smiled. It seemed this old Human Lord was as clear as a mirror, understanding everything and seeing everything clearly. If Jiang Hai or Yunshui were in charge, it might indeed cause problems.

Once Hundred Battle left, Xia Huyou smiled, "Seniors, if you have any instructions, feel free to let me know! I'll do my best to arrange for someone to handle it. Whatever you need, I'll do my utmost!"

Jiang Hai Marquis gave him a cold look, saying after a long pause, "Don't think that just because His Majesty is lenient, you can keep provoking!"

Xia Huyou looked helpless. What did I provoke? Are you perhaps a fool? Forget it, not worth the effort.

Nearby, Marquis Zhennan frowned slightly, coughing lightly, "Jiang Hai, let it go. You should also want to see the current Human Realm. Let me show you around!"

"There's nothing worth seeing!" Jiang Hai Marquis said indifferently, "This... is no longer the Human Realm of old!"

Marquis Zhennan was slightly taken aback, then smiled, "You can't say that. This is still our root, our homeland..."

Jiang Hai Marquis said coldly, "But do you think the current Human Race welcomes our return? Zhennan, we have nothing left here—no descendants, no family, no friends. Apart from this realm, everything here has nothing to do with us!"

Marquis Zhennan frowned, feeling a bit down, "But this is our place of origin! Jiang Hai!"

Jiang Hai Marquis said coldly, "It's just a place, not the people! Zhennan, wake up!"

Marquis Zhennan frowned, looking at him, then at Marquis Nanxi and Marquis Yunshui, asking in a low voice, "Do you two feel the same?"

Marquis Nanxi sighed, "Don't listen to Jiang Hai's nonsense! Jiang Hai, homeland is still homeland. The Human Race here shares the same roots. Some things shouldn't be mentioned again. What happened six thousand years ago might seem right to us, but... in others' eyes, it might indeed be wrong!"

Jiang Hai Marquis snorted, "Wrong? Should we have fought to the death back then, clashing with the Myriad Races until both sides were severely wounded, only to be wiped out by the Control King's lineage? Should the entire Human Race have been annihilated? I don't understand why these people think it was wrong! Even back then! If we hadn't followed His Majesty's words, Nanxi, do you think the Human Race would still exist today?"

He felt there was no point in arguing with these people. If they hadn't fought to the death back then, there might not be a Human Race today! Not a shred of hope!

Seeing them argue among themselves, Xia Huyou wasn't interested in watching the drama. He greeted the other prefects with a smile and quickly led them away! With Hundred Battle gone, why bother arguing with these guys?

...

At the same time, Hundred Battle entered the River of Time to search for Shadow and Mist Mountain. These two had just fallen, so they might still be alive.

...

Meanwhile, in the Luminous Domain Mansion, Su Yu wasn't waiting for Liu Hong and Zhou Hao. He had Marquis Tongtian send him back first. He planned to take the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King to seek the path, to find a suitable path of blades and spears for them. As for the path of the Desolate Beast, he could extract the power of laws to help everyone restore their physical bodies.

In the River of Time, Su Yu also entered, using the opening he had dug himself. He and Hundred Battle, one in front, one behind, one on the left, one on the right. At this moment, both were exploring the great paths within the river. Su Yu was searching for a suitable path of blades and spears, while Hundred Battle was looking for the paths of Shadow and Mist Mountain.

...

In the River of Time, the Great Xia King was also looking around, muttering, "Your Majesty, find me a powerful path of the blade! It has to be stronger than my grandson's!"

His grandson, Xia Longwu, had already stepped into the Daofuse Realm! When he swung his blade, his strength might not be as great, but his blade aura was more vigorous. The first blade master of the Xia family was no longer the Great Xia King, a sad affair!

"Of course!" Su Yu laughed, "It definitely has to be stronger than Xia Longwu's. Otherwise, wouldn't it tarnish the title of the world's number one..."

"Ahem!" The Great Xia King coughed. What are you trying to say? Truly... annoying!

The Great Qin King turned to look at them, puzzled, "What's going on?"

"None of your business!" The Great Xia King couldn't be bothered with him.

The Great Qin King sneered, the kind of sneer that didn't reach his eyes. He wasn't one to smile often, but at this moment, his smile was ugly, "Isn't it about the world's number one handsome man?"

"..." The Great Xia King was stunned! He suddenly looked at Su Yu, who shrugged, "Don't look at me, it's got nothing to do with me!"

The Great Qin King scoffed, "What are you looking at! Senior Xia Chen is down there, are you blind? A few days ago, Senior Xia Chen was talking to us about the past, saying everything! Even about you wetting the bed as a child! Oh, you weren't there at the time, your grandson called you away. Fortunately, apart from Xia Longwu, probably everyone knows now. Is that a secret?"

"..." Su Yu shrugged. Oh my, this is truly embarrassing. I'm someone who keeps secrets!

This isn't something I said; it's what your Xia family members themselves mentioned. I even heard it from Xia Chen. He didn't think it was a big deal. In his eyes, the Great Xia King is still that naive young man.

The Great Xia King's face turned purple!

Everyone knows?

He gritted his teeth and asked in a low voice, "Everyone knows?"

"Of course!" The Great Qin King replied nonchalantly, "We were all there at the time, so naturally, we all heard it!"

"Why... why didn't anyone tell me these past few days?"

The Great Xia King was furious, but the Great Qin King reassured him, "It's nothing. To put it bluntly, who doesn't have a bit of a dark history nowadays? Don't worry, it's confined to this era. We've all agreed that in the future, no one is allowed to mention it again! Everything will be sealed away! If anyone dares to leave a single word about it, we'll all band together against them!"

He glanced at Su Yu. Do you understand?

Do you get it?

This applies to you too!

We may be in the dark now, but the next generation must not know about it!

Su Yu nodded slightly, his expression calm. No problem.

I'm not that kind of person!

I've already thought it through. After I retire, I'll engrave the chronicles of this era deep within the Great Dao.

Rest assured, unless someone of the highest caliber, a monstrous talent, discovers it, no one will find the legends we've left behind. But still, we must leave a sliver of hope for future generations to understand the legends.

Beside him, the Great Xia King sighed, almost wanting to cover his face and cry!

How embarrassing!

I don't want to live anymore!

These things happened so many years ago, and yet they're still being talked about. And my Xia family even has an ancestor who blabs about everything and doesn't think it's a big deal.

I'm not a child anymore!

Now, I'm the renowned Great Xia King of the Human Realm, and this is just nonsense!

And there's no way to vent this anger.

Su Yu listened to their idle chatter with a smile, feeling rather good at the moment.

Continuing to explore the Great Dao, the Great Xia King no longer mentioned that matter but instead asked seriously, "Your Majesty, do you think resurrection... can really succeed?"

Xia Chen is also among the dead spirits.

Su Yu smiled, "I have some confidence, but... it's hard to say! Resurrection has many difficulties! First, suppressing the Death Path, as they are all essentially bound by it! Second, granting them vitality, but where does this vitality come from? Is the Path of Life enough to resurrect them?"

"Third, connecting to the Time Path to restore their original path, which is actually quite difficult! According to the Culture King's idea, just cobbling together some path would suffice, and the Paper Path was probably prepared for this!"

"Fourth, after resurrection, the resurrected might not be tolerated by heaven and earth!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Perhaps... the Time Path will no longer accommodate them, nor will the Death Path! They are actually being rejected in the Myriad Realms and the Death Realm!"

The Great Qin King was silent for a moment, "Then what does Your Majesty suggest?"

"Two choices!"

"First, find a way to go to the Upper Realm and connect to the Human Emperor's Path. Second... connect to my path!"

Both were shocked!

Connect to your path?

What would be the result?

Su Yu calmly said, "Connecting to the Human Emperor's Path would make them pseudo-path experts. Connecting to my path... would make them pseudo-pseudo-path experts! Even more pseudo! Because my path is too weak, too narrow. If they follow me, let's put it this way: I currently only possess the combat power of a top-tier Heavenly Sovereign. If they follow me and I don't improve, at most, they can only become Heavenly Kings, never surpassing me! Moreover, their combat power will be constrained by the power of laws within the entire path!"

Su Yu sighed, "I still hope the Time Path can accommodate them. Otherwise, neither of these choices is a good one! At least for now, neither I nor the Human Emperor have paths that are adequate!"

Compared to the perfected Time Path, there's a significant gap.

The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King exchanged glances, both frowning slightly.

This is not an easy choice!

However, the Great Qin King still said, "I think if there's really no other way, everyone might choose Your Majesty's path. But will it affect Your Majesty?"

Su Yu smiled and shook his head, "No, it will only help me perfect the path! If it really had an impact, the Time Path wouldn't be open to the heavens for everyone to comprehend. Everyone comprehending the path also helps perfect the power of the path!"

"That's a good thing!"

The Great Qin King laughed, "If Your Majesty can quickly become the master of the rules, naturally everyone can rise with the tide. I don't see anything wrong with it. If it really doesn't work, Old Xia and I can try first. Otherwise... Your Majesty, why not give us the Path of Blades and Spears in your path?"

Su Yu was taken aback, and the Great Xia King also smiled, "The paths of the Myriad Realms are too scattered! A single Blade Path is divided into hundreds of paths, but Your Majesty's path has only one Blade Path. Once Your Majesty becomes powerful, we'll be the undisputed masters of the rules!"

The Great Xia King laughed, "Even now, Old Qin and I aren't Heavenly Kings, but if we each master a path, maybe we can still possess the combat power of a Heavenly King, even if it's just a pseudo-Heavenly King! A pseudo-Heavenly King... is still a Heavenly King! At worst, we'll be like Your Majesty, not good at prolonged battles. But do strong battles really care about lasting too long?"

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly looked at the two of them, frowning slightly, "Did you two... plan to wait here for me today?"

Why do I suddenly feel like these two are setting me up?

Suddenly bringing up the resurrection of the dead spirits, then mentioning the path, even though I was the one who said it, I still feel like I've been schemed against, trapped by these two!

The Great Qin King coughed lightly, "We weren't waiting here for Your Majesty!"

The Great Qin King sighed, "We... actually, Old Xia and I are self-aware! We lack the accumulation, the strength. If we switch paths, can we become Heavenly Kings? Your Majesty, you tell us, besides you, who else has become a Heavenly King in this tide?"

"Lantian and Wan Tiansheng, they also opened their own paths, not following a fixed path. Opening a path is different. Old Xia and I are ultimately a step behind. Can we open the Blade and Spear Paths? What we open might not even be as strong as we are now!"

"So Old Xia and I thought, Your Majesty's current paths might not be strong enough, but we can nurture them!"

He continued, "The myriad paths were also nurtured by everyone. If we each master a path, if it doesn't work, we'll just steal more power of blades and spears from the River of Time. That way, it won't just be Your Majesty nurturing the path alone!"

The Great Xia King also nodded, "Consort Qi also said that true and pseudo-paths can actually merge! Old Qin and I mean that we can first merge a path here, then bring the power of the true path and merge it into Your Majesty's Blade and Spear Paths. This way, we benefit, and Your Majesty will benefit too! If there are really ten thousand people merging paths, each merging one path, maybe Your Majesty's path can quickly become complete!"

Su Yu looked at the two of them, frowning, "This doesn't seem like something you thought of yourselves. Who's encouraging you?"

Is this feasible?

Of course, it's feasible!

However, Su Yu said coldly, "I feel like someone is encouraging you. You need to know that if I die, you're finished, it's over! If my path breaks, you'll all end up like me, finished together!"

The Great Xia King laughed, "Can we separate now?"

We can't separate!

The Great Qin King also said solemnly, "Old Xia is right. We can't separate! Didn't Your Majesty also use the Human Lord Seal as the foundation of your path? If the Human Lord Seal shatters, Your Majesty probably won't have a good ending either! Old Zhou means that those who have no hope of advancing further, who can't advance to Heavenly King in the River of Time, should just merge into Your Majesty's path!"

"Pseudo-path Heavenly Kings are still pseudo-path Heavenly Kings. Even if they're not as good as true Heavenly Kings, two against one should still be possible, right?"

"If Your Majesty's path is perfected, then it's like one person achieving the Dao and everyone else rising with them!"

"By then, we can also be considered the ancestors of the path!"

The Great Qin King said calmly, "Our fates have long been intertwined! The day Old Xia and I pushed you to be the Human Lord, we could only advance and retreat together! You give us individual paths, and we nurture the path for you. If you die, we'll all be finished together! If we die, your path will probably suffer too!"

"Great Zhou King..."

Su Yu murmured, unable to help but laugh, "That old thing, is he encouraging you again?"

"Not exactly."

The Great Qin King said, "Though he's annoying, what he says isn't without reason! Your Majesty, how long do you think it will take for Old Xia and me to advance to Heavenly King?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, "If things go smoothly, maybe... three to five years?"

Possibly!

The Great Qin King laughed, "Even if it's three to five years, will it be in time? If we merge into Your Majesty's Spear Path, how long will it take for us to become pseudo-path Heavenly Kings?"

Su Yu calculated, "If I assist you in mastering it, very soon! However, this Heavenly King will have a significant gap in strength compared to a true-path Heavenly King, not as good as a Heavenly King of the Human Emperor's path, dropping a level in calculation, only equivalent to a second-tier Daofuse!"

Merging into his path requires dropping a level.

Even if they merge into his path and reach Heavenly Sovereign, they can only be considered to have the combat power of a Heavenly King.

In this regard, the Human Emperor's path is much stronger than Su Yu's.

The Great Qin King asked again, "If Your Majesty truly attains the power of a master of rules, will our strength rise with it?"

It feels like investing in original shares!

Su Yu laughed, "Yes! Once I truly possess that power, your strength will also increase."

At this point, Su Yu didn't say much more about this and directly said, "Think it over yourselves before making a decision, rather than listening to the Great Zhou King's nonsense!"

The two nodded. They're not children anymore; they know how to make choices.

At this moment, Su Yu silently explored the Great Dao, also pondering in his heart.

As he was thinking, his eyes moved slightly.

In a distant place, a figure also paused slightly.

The next moment, a Heaven Gate appeared on Su Yu's forehead. Similarly, in the distance, a portal appeared on that person's forehead, and the two looked at each other across the void.

After a moment, Su Yu's eyes flickered, and he said, "Let's head back the way we came. This side might not have the path we're looking for!"

The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King didn't sense anything and both nodded.

Su Yu turned around and led his people back the way they came. In the distance, the Hundred Battle King paused for a moment before also turning to head back. After walking a short distance, both turned their heads simultaneously, locking eyes once more.

The Hundred Battle King hesitated briefly, then a wave of energy swept over, "If you wish to return... the Human Realm is yours. I will go to the Giant Realm!"

"No need for now!" Su Yu replied, his own energy rippling, "Whoever is stronger shall take the lead! The premise is, do not stir up trouble in the Human Realm. You and I have both served as the Human Lord!"

"Indeed!" The Hundred Battle King's energy carried a hint of amusement, "Regarding the matter with Yunshui and the others, I know you might hold a grudge... each serves their own master. Any grievances, count them against me!"

"We'll see!" Su Yu didn't engage further. Soon, the two parted ways, each walking until their energies could no longer connect, leaving the recent encounter behind. It was better not to meet. Even if they did, there was nothing much to discuss.

...

The Great Xia King and the Great Qin King were oblivious to the encounter. They vaguely sensed some energy fluctuations. Meanwhile, Su Yu's expression turned slightly grave. The Hundred Battle King... was strong! Stronger than he was now! Indeed, over the past six thousand years, he hadn't been idle.

Does he see no chance of victory? Are the trump cards of the myriad races and the Control King's lineage even stronger than I anticipated?

While pondering, the Great Qin King indeed sensed a spear path and joyfully began to merge with it. He planned to first merge with the path, steal its true power, and then channel it into Su Yu's Great Dao!

On the other side, the Hundred Battle King also extracted a powerful figure from a Great Dao, the Shadow Marquis. At this moment, the two top human experts were both strengthening their respective sides, preparing to participate in the Upper Realm War.

Yes! The Upper Realm War! These two were destined not to merely watch from the lower realm. As long as the opportunity was right, both would join the battle, aiming to first annihilate the Control King's lineage and the myriad races!

At this moment, there was a tacit understanding between the two sides. At least the leaders had an understanding. First, they would enhance their strength, and as for the Human Realm, they would deal with it after defeating all parties.

Su Yu was even contemplating how to proactively strike against the rulers of the myriad races, preferably before the Heaven Gate and the Gate of Hell opened! Waiting passively was not a good option. Once the Human Emperor and others returned, and both gates opened, it would be a huge problem.

Soon, the Great Xia King also found a blade path and began merging with it. As for the Great Dao of the Desolate Beast, both temporarily abandoned it. Su Yu temporarily sealed it, waiting to extract its power to satisfy everyone's physical cultivation needs.

P.S.: Exhausted, this chapter is a setup, lacking passion. As mentioned before, I'll take a leave after the 18th. I'll write a leave note later. There's a meeting at the end of the year here at Qidian, and I'll meet with some authors. I'll take a two-day break and return with renewed passion to write the next big plot.
