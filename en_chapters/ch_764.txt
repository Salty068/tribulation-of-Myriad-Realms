Chapter 764: Everything is Ready (Please Subscribe)

Cultivation, no matter how painful, becomes bearable when you have someone to share the pain with. Everyone suffers together!

When everyone has a dark past, no one will bring it up again, and these stories will fade away in the river of history. Perhaps, in the future, some unofficial history books might record a certain year and month when Emperor Yu and some powerful beings cried out for their parents to save them... Of course, future generations might not believe it.

In the River of Time, everyone was howling and crying out in pain. This might be the first time a group of beings below the level of rulers of laws was comprehending the primitive path, the wild power of the Great Dao untempered by the Time Dao.

The breaches and breaks were being repaired. The leaking river water was gradually decreasing. Below, Lantian continued to regulate the power of the Great Dao. Perhaps only Lantian and some who had not yet reached the Eternal level had not ascended. Lantian needed to manage the entire power of the Great Dao to prevent errors and chaos. Of course, whether he ascended or not was irrelevant; Lantian's dark history could fill a book, and no one would care about these things.

As these people repaired the Great Dao, some experts on the verge of breaking through began to advance!

On the human side, King of Han and others had long been close to breaking through, but they were always missing something. This missing piece was their lack of understanding of the Great Dao, a lack of direct contact. Today, Su Yu provided them with the opportunity.

Several of them, including King of Han, had switched paths. King of Han walked the path of strength, similar to the path of the physical body, but with differences. He proved his Dao through strength, not through the sheer power of the physical body.

At this moment, with a roar, King of Han, a long-standing powerful presence among the human Eternals, finally broke through the shackles today, shattered the barriers, and with a thunderous boom, his aura surged, officially stepping into the Daofuse Realm!

He was not the only one!

Over there, Heavendoom's companions, the guardians like Frost and Snow who hadn't advanced yet, were not walking the path of the physical body; they all followed the Weapon Fusion Method, merging different paths. At this time, they too advanced one after another.

Back when Heavendoom and the others advanced, these people were just one step behind. They were all veteran high-stage Eternals, and when they killed the undead, they almost all stepped into the ninth stage of the Eternal Realm. In recent days, some had even gone to the Upper Realm to fight and had comprehended these powers of the Great Dao.

In an instant, several guardians stepped into the Daofuse Realm!

On the Iron Devourer Race's side, August let out a roar. This frustrated prince of the Iron Devourer Race howled to the sky, shouting, "I’ve advanced!"

He had been frustrated for too long! He had been a prince for so long, his father had passed, and June had promised that he would be the next to ascend the throne. Yet, before he could take the throne, he became the retired emperor! Yes, his son September advanced to the Daofuse Realm first and took the throne before him!

At this moment, he finally stepped into the Daofuse Realm! It was a type of physical path, using the seventy-two castings of the Iron Devourer to fuse the Dao, rather than September's devouring Great Dao.

August roared continuously!

And at this moment, the Iron Devourer Race was quite interesting. March, April, May, June, August, and September all stepped into the Daofuse Realm, along with Giant Bamboo and Full Moon. This race, both in the Upper and Lower Realms, produced a total of eight Daofuse Realm experts, and none of them were weak.

The Five Elemental Race produced six Daofuse Realm experts, while the Iron Devourer Race produced eight.

The previously powerful Fate Clan didn't send many people this time, only the Fate Emperor was here, and the other Eternals didn't come.

As for the Fate Emperor, his aura was ethereal and elusive. At this moment, you couldn't tell if he had advanced or not, but Su Yu glanced over, and his eyes flickered. The silent Fate Emperor should have stepped into the Heavenly King Realm!

As for the Hou Race, the Hou Pseudo Emperor also stepped into the third-class Daofuse Realm, but at this moment, the Hou Pseudo Emperor seemed somewhat overshadowed.

Because, apart from him, the Hou Race's other Eternals were somewhat stronger, but none advanced to the Daofuse Realm.

All races were progressing, except for the Hou Race, which seemed to have made little progress.

However, the Hou Race's Tun Tian successfully proved the Dao, and his aura grew rapidly, reaching the strength of an Eternal sixth or seventh stage in the blink of an eye. But this was not enough; the gap was too large.

The Hou Race seemed to be declining, unable to even compare to the Five Elemental Race!

However, at this time, Su Yu also noticed the situation of the Hou Race.

Su Yu wasn't very familiar with the Hou Race, even though Tun Tian later followed him, he wasn't very familiar with them. However, he was familiar with the Hou Pseudo Emperor's son; this race was quite similar.

But Su Yu still recognized one of the ancient Hou at a glance.

Back on Mingguang Island, the Hou King who went to catch the Mingguang Bird!

Su Yu had said the Mingguang Bird was delicious, and this Hou King eagerly went to eat the Mingguang Bird, eating with oil dripping from his mouth, and even wanted to enclose the Mingguang Bird Realm as his own food garden.

This was also Su Yu's first interaction with the Hou Race. Later, when Su Yu went to the Hou Race, it was he and Tun Tian who welcomed Su Yu.

At this moment, Su Yu looked at the ancient Hou who was frantically devouring the power of the Great Dao but couldn't step into the Daofuse Realm, and he smiled, "Xiu Wu, don't randomly devour the power of the Great Dao!"

Yes, his name was Xiu Wu. A rather strange name.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor's father actually held a high status, at least in the eyes of the myriad races, because his father was the Martial King's mount. The Hou Pseudo Emperor was also extremely ancient, but his aptitude seemed average, previously only possessing the power of a fourth-class Daofuse Realm, perhaps even less.

Only now did he step into the third-class.

This Xiu Wu was considered the grandson of the Hou Race's ancestor, but his strength wasn't particularly strong.

Xiu Wu... perhaps this name had some connection to the Martial King.

The ancient Hou was anxiously devouring various powers of the Great Dao. At this moment, hearing Su Yu call him, he looked up with some anxiety and frustration.

The Five Elemental Race produced six Daofuse Realm experts, while his Hou Race, to this day, only his father was Daofuse.

In the Upper Realm, the Hou Race was also weak, with only one second-class Daofuse existence.

He wanted to step into the Daofuse Realm! But why couldn't he?

Being chosen as the Martial King's mount indicated that his grandfather was actually very strong; otherwise, the Martial King wouldn't have taken a liking to him. Why was each generation weaker than the last?

The first generation must have been a ruler of laws, the second generation reached third-class Daofuse, and the third generation wasn't even Daofuse.

Such regression was actually quite severe.

Under normal circumstances, the first-generation bloodline of a ruler of laws should have no problem reaching the Heavenly King level.

The second-generation bloodline reaching the Heavenly King level was normal; not reaching it shouldn't mean they couldn't even become Daofuse.

With so many strong beings among the myriad races, during that era, the Martial King was one of the Four Extremes Human Kings, holding a high position. Even if it was just a mount, its status might have been higher than some emperors of the myriad races.

Actually, Su Yu was also a bit puzzled.

After all, whether it was the Iron Devourer Race or other races, the direct bloodline of a ruler of laws shouldn't be this weak.

The Hou Race... he observed them more closely today.

This race seemed to be walking the path of devouring as well.

Tun Tian, from the name, you could see some ambition. Tun Tian's talent wasn't weak; he was also ranked among the top on the Proving Dao List back then.

However, after observing for a while, Su Yu took a closer look...

Suddenly, he was a bit distracted.

This race might have been tricked by the Martial King.

The Martial King might not have done it intentionally, but... there's a high probability that they were indeed tricked by this reckless Martial King. Logically, a peerless expert who opened the Heaven Gate and reached the level of the Four Extremes Human Kings shouldn't be so misleading... but there's always a chance.

Su Yu carefully observed for a while, opened the Heaven Gate, and scrutinized them. After a moment, he shouted, "The Hou Race might not be fierce beasts!"

"..."

At this moment, both the Hou Pseudo Emperor and Xiu Wu, as well as Tun Tian, looked at Su Yu.

Not only these few, but others also looked at Su Yu.

What nonsense?

With the Hou Race's fierce and menacing appearance, they aren't fierce beasts?

Over there, even Heavendoom stopped crying and suddenly burst into laughter, "Old Hou isn't a fierce beast? Could it be a violent beast?"

Su Yu's gaze shot over, and Heavendoom awkwardly stopped laughing.

Su Yu said loudly, "The Hou Race is considered fierce beasts, probably even they themselves think so, because the first Hou Emperor was under the Martial King. The Martial King was skilled in battle and probably led the first Hou Emperor to conquer the myriad realms many times!"

"Over time, perhaps even the first Hou Emperor himself was influenced, thinking of himself as a fierce and brutal being..."

"However, I observe your Great Dao, and there isn't much ferocity in it!"

Su Yu looked towards the distant Old Turtle, "Senior Hongmeng, you are the oldest. Did you have any early contact with the Hou Race?"

In the distance, the Old Turtle was slightly taken aback, falling into memories.

His existence was ancient, a being born after the opening of the heavens, strictly speaking, probably born in the early Taigu period.

The Hou Race...

The Old Turtle's life memories were too many. At this moment, he vaguely recalled, not too sure, "There was contact, a very long time ago. Back then, the first Hou Emperor was extremely powerful. I remember... I vaguely remember that it was the Culture King's idea to find the first Hou Emperor as a mount... The Culture King... The Culture King seemed to have said that the Martial King was impulsive, and having the first Hou Emperor accompany him might change the Martial King."

Su Yu laughed, "That's right! I observe the Hou Race's Great Dao, and it's clear and bright, without the ferocity and violence. Clearly, it's a path of clarity, so how could it be so brutal? Devouring the heavens and earth, devouring everything, devouring all things... this doesn't make sense!"

"I think the Culture King suggested the Martial King find the Hou Race as a companion, not to give the Martial King an extra fighter, but to give him a supervisor! The Hou Race, with clear minds and fierce appearances, can make wise decisions. This is clearly a benevolent beast, not a fierce beast..."

The Hou Pseudo Emperor and the others were all stunned.

What a joke!

With our appearance, we're benevolent beasts?

Nonsense!

Our lineage devours everything, fights dragons and phoenixes, eats everything under the sky, and you say we're benevolent beasts?

That's funny!

Su Yu laughed, "The fact is, the first Hou Emperor's role was actually to admonish the Martial King! The Culture King brought the first Hou Emperor to accompany the Martial King to give him more strategic advice. However... the first Hou Emperor was probably led astray by the Martial King!"

The Martial King's charm must have been significant.

The long companionship had not only failed to influence the Martial King but had instead led the Hou Pseudo Emperor to be influenced by him, transforming from an advisor and overseer into a ferocious beast. Consequently, the descendants of the Hou Pseudo Emperor naturally inherited this influence, believing their race to be savage beasts meant to devour the myriad races.

This statement left everyone momentarily stunned.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was an advisor? Surely, that was a joke!

Su Yu, however, smiled and said, "It's just a guess, but it's also a deduction, inferred from observing the Dao! Your Dao isn't inherently violent. Being overly ruthless may not necessarily lead to progress! The Hou Pseudo Emperor is one of the older Daofuse Realm cultivators today, yet he struggles to advance to the Heavenly King level, barely reaching the third tier... Perhaps it's time to change your approach, to not always resort to violence and killing... Try to be a bit more gentle."

The powerful members of the Hou Race were taken aback.

But... we've been ruthless for countless years.

All we know is to eat, devour, and consume. How could this be wrong?

Even the Hou Pseudo Emperor was surprised, "Emperor Yu, how do we become gentle?"

They didn't understand!

They were used to devouring dragons and phoenixes, accustomed to the blood and gore. How could they suddenly become gentle? They simply didn't know how!

Su Yu also found this challenging. Indeed, habits, especially deeply ingrained ones, are hard to change.

The Dao... does it always have to follow the path of predecessors? Must it conform to the ways of those before?

Thinking of this, Su Yu suddenly said, "If it really doesn't work, perhaps you should change your Dao! As members of the Hou Race, you naturally find it easy to integrate into the Dao of the first Hou Pseudo Emperor. When you first proved your Dao, it was probably a forced fit... In reality, your Dao doesn't match that of the first Hou Pseudo Emperor! If you consider yourselves to be on the path of devouring, then follow the path of devouring!"

Su Yu quickly added, "Currently, there are a few paths you can choose! First, follow the devouring path of September, but September is likely to become a master of rules, and I won't allow you to compete with him for the Dao."

"Second, follow the devouring path of Senior Flatbread... but the result would be the same. Although both September and Flatbread's paths are about devouring, they differ in type. However, Senior Flatbread is a spirit of the Great Dao, and perhaps another master of rules could emerge..."

"Third, I can find another devouring path for the Hou Race to cultivate!"

Su Yu declared loudly, "In the world, there are countless Great Daos, and even within the same devouring path, there are multiple Daos! Now that I have a deeper understanding of the Great Dao, finding another devouring path from the River of Time shouldn't be difficult! As for whether it has a master, I'm not sure! But I believe if you don't change your path... even the Hou Pseudo Emperor might never become a Heavenly King!"

This was the legitimate son of a master of rules, yet he had no hope of becoming a Heavenly King. It was harsh, but Su Yu could deduce that this was likely the outcome.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor's face twisted as he looked at Su Yu. It wasn't out of malice; he just naturally looked that way. He struggled and said, "Emperor Yu, are you saying we chose the wrong path? That my father's Dao isn't suitable for me?"

How could that be!

Su Yu nodded, "Your father wasn't truly savage. Blame the Martial King; he influenced your father too much, ultimately leading to your father's deviation..."

It was laughable and frustrating.

Was it true?

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was reluctant to believe it because his father was a fierce individual who followed the Martial King, devouring powerful beings from the myriad realms with ruthless abandon.

You say my father was inherently good?

Headache!

However, Su Yu had opened the Heaven Gate and observed the Great Dao. Moreover, he had indeed been stuck in the Daofuse Realm for many years. Others had advanced to the Heavenly King level, yet he remained a mere Daofuse cultivator, barely advancing to the third tier through sheer accumulation over time.

Was he really wrong?

He looked towards Tun Tian and the others. If they were wrong... the Hou Race might never produce a truly top-tier expert in the future.

Changing paths... this was indeed risky because the new path might not suit the Hou Race.

But after some thought, he resolutely said, "Since Emperor Yu believes my father's Dao doesn't suit me... I'm willing to change paths! To find a new devouring path, as for September's path... forget it!"

It's not right to merge with someone else's path.

If conflicts arise later, it would be even worse!

Su Yu smiled, "Alright, but not now. Everyone should continue to comprehend. Once I've opened the passage and stabilized the tributary of the River of Time, I'll take you to find a more suitable Great Dao in the River of Time! Missing this opportunity is fine; there will be more chances ahead..."

The Hou Pseudo Emperor nodded, feeling a sense of melancholy.

Had he really misunderstood the power of the Great Dao?

It was hard to believe!

Alright, trust Emperor Yu.

After all, even Doubao had advanced to the Heavenly King level because he had previously misunderstood his path.

And Old Turtle seemed to be the same!

These individuals, without a strong expert to guide them in understanding the Dao, had all taken the wrong path until Su Yu appeared, correcting their course and helping them understand the essence of the Great Dao, allowing them to gradually advance into the Heavenly King realm.

For now, Su Yu didn't concern himself with the Hou Race.

Meanwhile, others were also making progress.

Flatbread knew his path was indeed the devouring path, and he devoured with joy. The devouring path was great; it didn't require much thought—just devour, devour, devour. Flatbread's mind was somewhat single-tracked; otherwise, he wouldn't have continued devouring those Eternals, letting them self-destruct within him.

After a while, a surge of energy rose from Flatbread, devouring everything.

Second-tier Daofuse!

Flatbread was overjoyed, continuing to devour madly. As he devoured, he almost went to devour September, suddenly finding September quite appetizing!

...

No one knew how much time had passed.

With a loud rumble!

Below, Lantian's voice echoed, "The myriad Daos have been stabilized!"

A flash of joy appeared in Su Yu's eyes as he shouted, "Alright, everyone, descend. The passage has been stabilized!"

This time, everyone had gained significantly.

However, Su Yu also knew they couldn't stay any longer. He glanced up, feeling a bit pained. The Mark of Civilization and the Starry Sky Seal had been worn down and were somewhat shattered. If they stayed any longer, these two treasures would be ruined!

A group of people quickly descended, each with a more intense aura, wilder than before!

The Dao remained the same.

But after comprehending some of the primitive power of the Great Dao, the power of their Daos was no longer as gentle as before, now carrying a hint of volcanic eruption.

The number of strong individuals was increasing.

And this time, two more Heavenly Kings had emerged: Doubao and the Fate Emperor.

Thus, under Su Yu's command, the number of Heavenly King-level experts was growing.

The Great Zhou King, Lantian, Wan Tiansheng, Marquis Huoyun, Fat Ball, Doubao, the Fate Emperor, Consort Qi, and Hongmeng—Su Yu could step into this realm at any time. Including him, there were a total of ten Heavenly King-level beings!

As for top-tier Daofuse cultivators, those Su Yu named second-tier Daofuse, there were also many.

The Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Flatbread, General Yingwu, Marquis Dingjun, and the Great Ming King barely caught up to the second tier. Additionally, there were Marquis Tongtian, September, and June, who had just reached the second tier. June was progressing quickly, and the Space Beast Emperor seemed to be just a step away.

Counting them, there were also ten.

In the third tier, Grandstar and Heavendoom had reached the third tier, along with the Hou Pseudo Emperor, Book Spirit, and Tea Plant.

There were many in the fourth tier, including Empyrean Cloud and others who had previously advanced, such as Duobao, Tian Yue, and Chongming, all in the fourth tier. Empyrean Cloud and the others were close to the third tier.

Empyrean Cloud had advanced alongside Heavendoom, but later, Empyrean Cloud mostly stayed in the lower realm, participating in fewer battles, and had been slightly weaker than Heavendoom before. Now, Heavendoom had pulled ahead.

Xia Longwu, upon advancing to the Daofuse Realm, felt he was almost in the fourth tier.

Looking around, there was truly an abundance of talent. As for the unique existence of Topsoil Spirit, he might soon step into the Heavenly King realm, similar to September, given enough time.

Because the Five Elemental Art was created by the Five Elemental Ancestor, and Topsoil Spirit was the essence of the Five Elemental Ancestor. This guy had just advanced, so he hadn't made much progress yet. But given enough time, Topsoil Spirit would inevitably step into the Heavenly King realm.

Su Yu's face now bore a radiant smile.

On the Human side, the Great Han King, Great Tang King, Great Shang King, and Great Song King had all stepped into the Daofuse Realm.

Under Marquis Dingjun's command, aside from Chongming, no one had entered the Daofuse Realm. However, under Marquis Huoyun's command, both Huoyue and Huobao had stepped into the Daofuse Realm.

Under General Yingwu's command, a general named Yingchao had also stepped into the Daofuse Realm.

Descending from the River of Time, Su Yu's smile grew even brighter!

This time, their strength hadn't diminished but had increased!

Some had left, like Shadow, Yunshui, and those who hadn't pledged allegiance, like Marquis Zhennan, and they had lost Wen Qi. But their strength was now much greater than before!

Su Yu looked at everyone and quickly smiled, "First, stabilize the tributary of the River of Time. Everyone, continue to comprehend and deepen your understanding! Once this harvest is over, take three days to rest and digest what you've gained. Then I'll take you to the chaotic place, where I'll open the Great Dao, and you can observe again for another chance to advance!"

Everyone was overjoyed!

How delightful!

The previous sorrow of migration... where was the sorrow?

This time, it was simply a grand distribution of benefits. What migration, forced by circumstances, was entirely orchestrated by Su Yu, deliberately abandoning the Myriad Realms.

Otherwise, with ten Heavenly Kings joining forces, could Hundred Battle really take them down?

What a joke!

Hundred Battle was strong, capable of dealing with three to five Heavenly Sovereigns, but could one Heavenly King handle several Heavenly Kings?

Lantian and Wan Tiansheng together could still hold off that Moon Qin, just barely.

Ten Heavenly Kings together would not fear Hundred Battle.

At this moment, everyone bowed in unison, shouting loudly, "Thank you, Emperor Yu!"

The grace of imparting the Dao!

The Dao is not lightly imparted!

However, Su Yu was unrestrained, openly imparting the Dao.

This was something people of other eras could not enjoy.

Su Yu smiled, "Alright, everyone, stabilize the River of Time. This was also an excellent opportunity for me to comprehend. I must also thank you all for helping me open this passage..."

He said no more and quickly helped Lantian stabilize the mouth of the Celestial River.

Su Yu began constructing the barrier for the tributary of the River of Time, channeling it into this place so that everyone could cultivate the Myriad Realms' Dao without being hindered by the Death Realm. In essence, he was creating a pure land within the Death Realm.

In ancient times, perhaps the Culture King and others could have done the same. However, they might have had reservations, considering this was the domain of the Death Dao's master, and it would be impolite to seize territory on someone else's land. Thus, they chose to open a passage in the Upper Realm. But Su Yu had no such scruples.

Who cares?

If those ancient beings have the capability, let them all come out. If they truly return, wouldn't the Culture King and the others also come back? At that point, it wouldn't be my problem anymore.

Building the barrier was indeed challenging, but Su Yu treated it as a test, a rehearsal before opening the heavens. Without this attempt to open the river's mouth, he might encounter numerous issues when he later opens the Dao. Discovering problems now meant they could still be remedied; later, it would be much harder to fix.

Su Yu was meticulous in his construction.

Lantian and the others were also diligently helping to organize the Dao. The more they comprehended, the clearer the path became. At this moment, the chaotic power of the Dao throughout the Abyssal Realm was gradually being gathered.

While Su Yu constructed the barrier, Wan Tiansheng was also busy. He directed those who no longer needed to assist to level the entire Abyssal Realm and reasonably distribute the thirty-six ancient cities across the land.

Five million people would soon live in this realm.

Everything needed to start anew!

Food was still necessary. Although the current supplies could feed five million people for decades, they couldn't rely on them indefinitely. Fields needed to be cultivated.

It was best if everything was indistinguishable from before, allowing everyone to adapt to life here.

Everyone busied themselves.

The vast Abyssal Realm was filled with people, and soon, Wan Tiansheng released some Shanhai Realm and Lingyun Realm cultivators to help build their homes. Then, he began releasing Skysoar Realm cultivators to dispel death energy and eliminate scattered undead.

A scene of prosperity!

Everyone was filled with hope, rebuilding their homes in this realm different from the Human Realm!

Although they firmly believed they would eventually return, living better here was also necessary.

The newly opened river mouth still had a lot of power flowing out, and at this moment, the entire realm was rich with the power of the Dao. Wan Tiansheng scattered large amounts of source qi liquid across the land.

They had plundered too many treasures from the Myriad Realms.

Numerous Heavenly Source Fruit trees were planted everywhere.

With the power of the Myriad Realms, they supported these millions of people.

Even if they truly returned one day, this realm rooted in the Death Realm would remain a strategic location, a crucial junction between life and death, as long as it wasn't destroyed.

Buildings rose from the ground.

Some structures were even moved intact from the Human Realm, now standing in various locations.

There were academies, libraries, treasuries, and ancient cities.

Gradually, the dark Abyssal Realm began to brighten.

Wan Tiansheng and the others constructed a massive star, radiating dazzling light.

There was a cycle of sun and moon!

The enormous star was half light, half darkness.

"The residents of the thirty-six prefectures can reside in the thirty-six ancient cities as before!"

"The ancient houses in the cities no longer emit death energy, sealing the thirty-six undead passages!"

"…"

People were gradually released.

Previously, everyone lived in the thirty-six prefectures, and now, with thirty-six cities, they could choose to live as before if they didn't want to mix.

"The Five Elemental Race, Iron Devourer Race, Ancient Hou Race, and Space Ancient Beast Race, with different customs and living environments, can establish separate holy lands. All expenses will be covered by the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

Wan Tiansheng and the others quickly arranged everything.

They aimed to settle the entire Abyssal Realm before Su Yu completed the barrier.

This was the era of the strong!

Everything was convenient; large quantities of materials could be transported via spatial transmission or spatial rings.

Buildings that didn't exist could be instantly constructed with giant stones.

Under Wan Tiansheng's orders, over ten thousand Earth Elemental Race experts were reinforcing the ground of the entire realm, building roads.

With the Five Elemental Race present, many tasks were easily accomplished.

The Five Elemental Race excelled at paving roads, channeling water, and cultivating greenery.

Large areas of flowers, grass, and trees appeared instantly in this realm.

Seeds fell, and soon, the trees provided shade.

Meanwhile, the Space Ancient Beast Race began helping construct teleportation channels, connecting the thirty-six ancient cities.

At this moment, the Iron Devourer Race could only watch, occasionally asking the Five Elemental Race to plant more bamboo mountains.

...

Su Yu, constructing the barrier, watched as the dark Abyssal Realm gradually brightened.

The previously eerie realm, akin to the underworld, suddenly had a sun, then trees providing shade, avenues crisscrossing, buildings standing tall, and ancient cities rising from the ground, bringing a smile to his face.

A satisfied smile!

Though not the Human Realm, this transformation might make it even better.

The Great Zhou King guided the power of laws, causing source qi rain to fall everywhere.

The Great Qin King and Great Xia King led millions of soldiers to station at the four extremes, defending against undead invasions.

The Great Ming King, with experts skilled in formations, constructed large arrays.

At this moment, everyone was joyful.

And Su Yu, gradually, also completed the barrier. It might not be very stable, but it was enough to support the existence of this tributary of the River of Time.

However, at the end, it needed to be interrupted; every Dao had an end.

The Human Emperor's Dao ended at a break, where a large amount of unclaimed power of laws flowed out, but it didn't affect anyone. Su Yu couldn't achieve that; he couldn't interrupt it out of thin air.

At this moment, Su Yu's gaze fell on Fat Ball!

The little white dog wagged its tail, seeing Su Yu looking at it, seemed to realize something. It glanced at the broken path constructed in the void and said, "You... want to move the master's house here?"

Su Yu smiled!

A radiant smile!

"Yes, I want to move the Culture King's Residence to the end of the Dao, as a giant stone blocking the path! On one hand, it can block the outflow of the river's time water, and on the other, moving it from the Human Realm, this is just a tributary, the impact won't be too strong, and Big Wood can come out anytime."

The true River of Time had too strong an impact.

Thus, the Culture King's Residence had always been unstable.

However, if moved here, the Culture King's Residence was still powerful, able to stand in the true River of Time, and here, it could be used as a dam!

This way, it served two purposes.

Fat Ball was a bit sad, "But... if we move, the master won't know the way back!"

Su Yu laughed, "Your master and the others can't return now. Once I find them, they'll naturally know where home is! Otherwise, left in the Human Realm, I'm worried it will eventually be washed away!"

Moving the Culture King's Residence meant there was nothing good left in the Human Realm.

Fat Ball thought for a while, then reluctantly said, "Alright! Then move it here! But... but it has to be moved back later!"

"Of course!"

Su Yu smiled, glad that Fat Ball agreed.

With this, the grand task of moving could proceed!

"Lantian, you maintain things here. I'll go to the Human Realm to move the Culture King's Residence... Tongtian, you're in charge of the teleportation!"

Su Yu was too lazy to run around. With Marquis Tongtian, teleportation was possible anywhere now.

Despite the barrier, Marquis Tongtian's teleportation ability was still strong, especially since he had reached the second-tier Daofuse Realm, making teleportation even easier.

Marquis Tongtian didn't argue, having been very obedient recently. After saying the wrong thing last time, he didn't dare to speak much.

Whatever Su Yu said, he did.

If Su Yu said teleport, then teleport it was.

...

Human Realm.

Su Yu returned once more.

This time, he didn't bother speaking with Marquis Zhennan and the others, heading straight to Starfall Mountain and diving into the Time Waterfall.

He wasn't entirely sure where the Culture King's Residence was on the River of Time.

He had never encountered it while traveling upstream, so it was likely built downstream.

Of course, wherever it was didn't matter much to Su Yu.

Here, the Culture King had opened a passage, the Time Waterfall, which he could enter at will without needing to traverse the River of Time.

"A passage..."

As Su Yu thought of this, he suddenly paused.

Yes, a passage.

Here... yes, it seemed a separate passage had been opened. Could it be that the Culture King also opened a river mouth at the Culture King's Residence?

Was the Time Waterfall essentially a passage?

Without dwelling on it, he entered the Culture King's Residence, where the flowers still bloomed.

At this moment, only Big Wood guarded the entire Culture King's Residence.

As Su Yu stepped in, he reached out and caught a large seal that fell into his hand.

At this moment, the Human Lord Seal displayed different scenes.

Su Yu glanced at it, realizing it was much stronger than before.

Vaguely, it seemed almost comparable to the Starry Sky Seal.

The Starry Sky Seal was indeed powerful because it was used during the peak of the human race, even before the Human Emperor unified the heavens, it was extraordinary.

Now, Su Yu's seal seemed to be catching up.

It was important to note that in this era, Su Yu's side didn't even have a single master of the rules, incomparable to the human race of the past.

"Has it integrated the power of the myriad races?"

The fortune of the Space Ancient Beast Race seemed to have merged into it as well.

This was likely the difference between the Starry Sky Seal and Su Yu's seal.

Behind him, the little white dog seemed reluctant. Seeing it look around nostalgically, Su Yu couldn't help but say, "Fat Ball, we're moving the house, you can see it every day. We're just changing the location of the house. If you're nostalgic, it should be for the River of Time outside, which might be different from what we have next."

Fat Ball misunderstood!

This house, including the courtyard and the mountain, I'm moving them all!

Su Yu stood in the midst of the swirling currents of the River of Time, contemplating the peculiarities of his surroundings. The house, solid and unyielding, remained anchored amidst the chaotic flow. He turned to Fat Ball, who was gazing around with a wistful expression.

"Why are you looking around like you're leaving something behind?" Su Yu asked, bemused.

Fat Ball blinked, then nodded as if realizing something profound. "You're right. I'm just moving the house. I'll still be living in it later. Even if the River of Time changes, the house remains."

Su Yu chuckled, then paused, a thought striking him. "Wait a minute... Have I overlooked something?"

Fat Ball tilted its head, puzzled. "What is it?"

"The Tea Plant... It's been bathing in the River of Time all this while?"

"Of course!" Fat Ball replied, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.

Su Yu was taken aback. He hadn't given it much thought before. The Tea Plant often took the form of a cute little girl, playing with Lantian's transformed child form, and he hadn't paid much attention. But now, he realized the River of Time was no ordinary bathhouse.

"Is the Tea Plant actually planted in the River of Time?" Su Yu asked, his brow furrowing.

"Yes!" Fat Ball confirmed, looking at Su Yu as if he were slow to catch on. "I told you when we first met. The Tea Plant was planted by the little master and the master in the River of Time. It grows by drawing water from the river. Isn't that obvious?"

Su Yu sighed, "Why didn't you say so earlier?"

"I did!" Fat Ball protested, feeling wronged. "I told you the first time we met. The Tea Plant was planted in the River of Time, and it bathes there. Of course, it draws water from the river to grow. Do I need to explain how it grows in detail?"

Su Yu shook his head with a wry smile. "Never mind. The Culture King and the Time Sage always had a penchant for the bizarre. Doubao is a spirit of the Great Dao, the Book Spirit is a book that attained the Dao, and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis is a spirit of fortune. At least you and Big Wood are relatively normal."

He paused, considering. "The Tea Plant... could it be that it attained the Dao through chaos?"

Fat Ball blinked. "Maybe. Chaos Dao is still a Dao, right?"

"It's different," Su Yu mused. "If the Tea Plant attained the Dao through chaos, it might not face any bottlenecks even at the level of a Heavenly Sovereign."

With that, Su Yu stepped out of the River of Time, emerging into the open. It was his first time entering this part of the river, and he found the surroundings unfamiliar. A house stood, encased in a halo of light, clearly anchored by the Culture King.

"Let's go!" Su Yu commanded, his voice firm. The Starry Sky Seal suppressed the river's waves, and the Mark of Civilization sank to the riverbed, lifting the massive house. It was heavy, but incredibly sturdy, withstanding the river's onslaught without a scratch.

Fat Ball glanced around the river one last time, lamenting, "The Tea Plant's bathhouse is gone. I wonder if it'll get used to a new one..."

Su Yu laughed softly, then, with a mighty heave, tore through the river, appearing before the Time Waterfall. As he emerged, the waterfall vanished behind him.

Standing in Starfall Mountain, Su Yu looked back, a sense of nostalgia washing over him. The Culture King had once opened a path here. The Time Waterfall was the mouth of the Celestial River. If the Culture King could open a path, perhaps he truly ventured into the unknown, leaving no trace behind. Where did he open his Dao?

"The Culture King... seems formidable. As the Time Sage's brother, he must have been quite capable," Su Yu remarked, a hint of admiration in his voice.

Fat Ball gave him an odd look, as if stating the obvious. "Of course, the little master isn't as strong as the master!"

Su Yu chuckled. "I used to think the Human Emperor, who opened the heavens, was stronger than the Culture King. But if the Culture King completed his path and could take it away at will... who is truly stronger?"

These ancient figures were shrouded in mystery, each more enigmatic than the last. Every time he pondered them, they seemed unfathomable.

With a sigh, Su Yu lifted the grand house and shouted, "Teleport!"

The Marquis Tongtian swiftly opened a massive portal, and Su Yu stepped through, disappearing from the Human Realm with the Culture King's Residence.

Shortly after Su Yu's departure, silence descended upon Starfall Mountain. The Time Waterfall, left behind, soon vanished completely, leaving no trace.

With a thunderous crash, the colossal house landed at the end of the severed river. The waters of time battered against it, but the house remained immovable, its strength terrifying.

Here, no one needed to guard it. The tributary was just a tributary, incomparable to the true River of Time. The meager stream couldn't hope to move the house.

At this point, the stolen tributary of the River of Time, albeit a crude version, was fully constructed. It was somewhat peculiar, though. The tributary was invisible, but the house was so large that it was visible in the void, losing its previous secrecy.

However, Su Yu had no choice. The tributary was too small to contain the house unless he expanded it to envelop the Culture King's Residence, which would require an unimaginable amount of effort.

For now, it would have to do. He'd make do with what he had.

With the transformation of the Abyssal Realm complete, the next step was to seal its entrance, preventing outsiders from entering and insiders from leaving, unless Su Yu himself opened it.

He aimed to completely isolate the realms of life and death.

Su Yu turned his gaze to the Marquis Tongtian, who looked bewildered. Su Yu smiled.

"The eighth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion has no passage. You can't reach the seventh floor unless you open a door. So, did you swallow the passage? If so, swallow the passage to the Abyssal Realm as well. No one can enter or exit without your portal."

The Marquis Tongtian looked helpless. "If I swallow it, what if I die?"

"If you die, will the passage disappear?"

"I don't know," the marquis replied, shaking his head. "It might disappear, or it might reappear in its original place."

"Then it doesn't matter!" Su Yu laughed. "If you really die, and it doesn't work, we'll find another way. If that fails, we'll use the small opening to enter the River of Time."

The passage between the realms of life and death wouldn't vanish completely.

The Marquis Tongtian had no more to say and went to swallow the passage.

Meanwhile, Su Yu called upon the Hou Pseudo Emperor. He intended to take them on a journey through the River of Time, to find a new path, and then open his own Dao.

It had been twenty days since he last descended to the lower realm.

As for where to open his Dao, Su Yu hadn't decided yet. He needed to quickly resolve these minor matters and retreat to the Abyssal Realm.

He had no idea how long he would remain in seclusion.
