Chapter 702: Marquis of Military Order

The Great Ming King was in charge of setting up camp.

Soon, a clearing appeared within the Soul Burying Mountain. The Great Ming King began to arrange formations, while Grandstar was responsible for clearing out the Soul Drilling Worms. As a fish-headed creature, he had his own methods for dealing with these little bugs.

Meanwhile, Su Yu silently observed the area.

The Heaven Gate opened, revealing the sky!

The Great Zhou King and Lantian quickly sensed their surroundings, gathering information. From Lantian's body, small bugs flew out, resembling the Soul Drilling Worms. As they split apart, he instructed, "Big Fish Head, don't eat me, alright?"

Grandstar was speechless.

Your whole family is the big fish head!

This weirdo had already started creating clones of the Soul Drilling Worms in such a short time.

Moments later, the Great Ming King emerged from the void, landed, and said in a low voice, "It's done."

"Let's go in!"

Su Yu stepped towards the clearing, and the group quickly followed. As they walked, the Great Zhou King laid down a silence formation.

...

Inside the formation.

With a wave of his hand, Su Yu conjured a massive map before everyone. Pointing at Liu Shan and another person, he said indifferently, "Release them. Come over and help me verify this map!"

Lantian chuckled and let the two go.

Even now, Liu Shan and his companion were still filled with dread. Who were these people? What were their strengths? They could vaguely discern some of the Eternal Realm cultivators, but a few others, including the white-haired man before them, were beyond their comprehension. This white-haired youth seemed to be their leader.

Youth?

They couldn't explain why, but despite feeling that this person was somewhat aged, they also sensed a youthful vigor, creating a contradictory impression.

Even after being released, the two were too terrified to struggle or flee.

Are you kidding?

There were at least three Daofuse Realm experts here!

The one who captured them, Lantian, the Great Ming King who set up the formation, and the Iron Devourer who remained in its original form—these three were all Daofuse!

As for the others... the two dared not even think about it.

There might be more than just these three Daofuse experts!

The white-haired youth, the smiling middle-aged man, and the fish-headed creature devouring the Soul Drilling Worms could all be Daofuse!

The more they thought about it, the more terrified they became.

Six Daofuse Realm experts?

Su Yu didn't care what they thought. Pointing at the map, he said calmly, "Verify the map. I have multiple versions. Help me check which one is the most accurate!"

He didn't say much more.

But Liu Shan and Du Bing weren't fools. Was this a test? If they messed up, they might die! These people seemed prepared, and verifying the map might just be a probe.

The two dared not speak further. Liu Shan quickly examined the map, carefully pointing out a spot after a while, "This isn't Yixian Gorge; it's Falling Head Valley."

Su Yu made a slight adjustment, and Liu Shan breathed a sigh of relief, continuing to point out other inaccuracies on the map.

Beside him, Du Bing also hurriedly observed and soon pointed out several errors.

After more than an hour, the two had corrected all the inaccuracies on the map.

With a wave of his hand, Su Yu made the map disappear.

At this moment, the entire formation changed. Tables and chairs appeared, crafted by the power of laws by these powerful individuals.

Su Yu sat down and casually said, "Have a seat, both of you."

"…"

Liu Shan and Du Bing were growing increasingly fearful. Who were these people?

They were sure some were human because they could sense the weaker ones. But there were also non-humans among them.

Were the ones they couldn't sense human?

Liu Shan and Du Bing didn't dare sit. Liu Shan, who appeared simple and honest but was actually sharper than Du Bing, quickly said, "We wouldn't dare. How could we take a seat before the esteemed ones?"

With several Daofuse experts standing, how could he dare to sit?

Su Yu said flatly, "When I tell you to sit, you sit. Obedience ensures longevity!"

Chilled to the core, Liu Shan dared not refuse and quickly pulled Du Bing to sit down.

Clearly, this white-haired youth was the leader here, and his word was law. This person seemed... seemed more terrifying than the Marquis of Military Order—not in terms of strength, which was hard to gauge, but in terms of aura and presence.

One look, and he seemed more fearsome than the Marquis of Military Order!

Su Yu looked at them and asked, "Do you know Zhao Chuan and the others?"

"We do."

Liu Shan quickly replied, "We're all part of the Military Order Guard. Are Zhao Chuan and the others still alive?"

"I'm the one asking questions."

Liu Shan dared not say more, but Du Bing hesitated, then gritted his teeth and asked, "May I ask, are you from the Lower Realm?"

"What if I am? What if I'm not?"

Du Bing gritted his teeth and said, "If not... we won't say anything!"

Su Yu felt weary and sighed, "Why are the humans of the Upper Realm so foolish?"

Lantian chuckled, "They are quite foolish."

The Great Zhou King was also embarrassed, "Perhaps they lack experience and knowledge. They've been besieged for so long, confined to a small circle, so it's understandable if they're a bit dull."

Du Bing and Liu Shan were furious!

What did that mean?

The Great Ming King glanced at the two, frowning slightly. Some didn't understand, but others did.

The Great Ming King interjected coldly, "Even at the seventh stage of the Eternal Realm, comparable to my previous strength, do you have no intelligence? Asking if we're from the Lower Realm? If we were from the myriad races of the Lower Realm, would we need to use this passage? Would we need to sneak up here? Truly foolish! Are the humans of the Upper Realm so strong? If not, would the myriad races need to be so secretive? If we were immortals or demons, would you still be alive? The message would have been sent through the Life Realm passage, and you'd be waiting here to receive it!"

He snorted, "Guarding such an important passage, even if your strength isn't great, you should at least have some brains. Yet here you are, lacking both strength and intelligence. Two fools!"

They were being looked down upon!

Liu Shan and Du Bing thought about it and realized... it made sense.

They were utterly ashamed!

In truth, it wasn't just them. Some of Su Yu's people hadn't thought of this either. They quickly put on a facade of having known all along, embarrassed that they almost asked why Su Yu was scolding them.

So... it was because of this.

Indeed, if they weren't human, and there were multiple Daofuse experts, they could only be a major race from the Lower Realm. Such a race would have a strong foundation in the Upper Realm and could directly contact Upper Realm experts through the Life Race passage. There was no need to sneak around.

Du Bing was embarrassed but persisted, "Then, are you humans? If so, why capture us..."

Su Yu leaned back in his chair, too lazy to respond.

Lantian said softly, "Why can't we capture you if we're human? The humans of the Upper Realm have been defeated repeatedly. How many have defected to the myriad races is still unknown. Can you say there isn't a single traitor among the humans of the Upper Realm?"

The two instantly fell silent.

Is there none?

Who knows!

Was Marquis Minshan betrayed when he was killed?

And over the years, some human experts had been ambushed. Was it due to traitors?

These were questions everyone had pondered, but they were powerless to address them, only able to manage their own affairs without solving others' problems.

Liu Shan took a deep breath and said, "Esteemed ones, since you know Zhao Chuan, you must have met them. We don't know more than they do. If you wish to meet the Marquis, we can return to inform him and arrange a meeting..."

"A meeting?"

Lantian chuckled softly, "Such arrogance! Such audacity! Let the Marquis of Military Order come to pay respects to Emperor Yu! A mere marquis dares to put on airs!"

"Emperor Yu?"

The two were shocked. What Emperor Yu?

Were these truly people from the Lower Realm?

Su Yu smiled, glancing at Lantian, "Your tone makes you sound like a villain. Stop causing trouble for me!"

Lantian quickly dropped the eerie tone and became coquettish, "I understand. I just found these two little friends too adorable and wanted to tease them."

Little friends?

How old are you!

Su Yu was helpless. This guy... forget it. He didn't want to talk to Lantian anymore.

At this moment, Su Yu was contemplating. After a while, he asked, "Great Zhou King, where do you think we should start? Should we first take down the Marquis of Military Order and use his power, or act independently?"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a moment before speaking, "With an elder present, the Marquis of Military Order surely knows more than the average person. He might even be able to contact other human Daofuse experts. If a new force suddenly appears in the Upper Realm, even if we disguise ourselves as subordinates of Marquis Tianyang... it might be better to blend in with the Marquis of Military Order. The myriad races know him well and won't be surprised by a sudden new force."

"So, you're suggesting we take down the Marquis of Military Order first?"

Su Yu looked at him, and the Great Zhou King nodded, "Yes, that's my thought! Moreover, we've captured these two. The Marquis of Military Order will find out sooner or later! Instead of letting him ruin things, we should take him down first!"

Beside him, the Great Ming King also said, "Emperor Yu, I think we should take down the Marquis of Military Order first! Not for anything else, but because he knows about the passage!"

The Great Ming King said solemnly, "If he has any issues, and we suddenly appear, he might deduce that we came through the passage and cut off our retreat! Of course, that's assuming he's a traitor! But anything is possible, so taking down the Marquis of Military Order is extremely necessary!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Previously, he had planned to act independently.

However, after arriving, he had some new thoughts.

The Great Ming King's concerns were valid. Su Yu and his group couldn't appear out of thin air. If the Marquis of Military Order knew about the passage and had sent people down, any issues could lead him to deduce that they came through the passage. If he then contacted the myriad races to cut off their retreat, it would be troublesome!

At this moment, Lanshan was also listening. Upon hearing these words, he became somewhat angry and hurriedly said, "The Marquis cannot possibly be a traitor! You all... you all..."

He was anxious!

Because this group of people didn't seem like good people at all.

Yes, not at all!

They were nothing like the people from the Lower Realm they had imagined. In their imagination, the Lower Realm was a miserable place where an Eternal might be the supreme existence. Knowing of the Upper Realm's existence, they would treat it as a lifeline, even if the Upper Realm was also difficult, because it had Daofuse Realm humans!

If the people from the Lower Realm were as imagined, they would definitely be respectful upon emerging from the passage and would plead with them to take them to see Marquis Dingjun.

But... it was nothing like they imagined!

These people were very powerful, with many in the Daofuse Realm, and even those not in the Daofuse Realm were high-level Eternals.

And they were very arrogant!

Lower Realm?

To Lanshan and the others, these people seemed to be of a higher existence, looking down on the Daofuse Realm of the Upper Realm with disdain.

Were these people really from the Lower Realm's human race?

It was hard to believe!

Su Yu ignored them and said, "Marquis Dingjun resides in the Bright Moon Flower Valley, which is considered one of the dangerous places! We are not familiar with that place, and if we go there rashly and he escapes..."

Su Yu stroked his chin. "That would be very troublesome!"

Lantian chuckled, "Can he escape? According to Zhao Chuan, this one is at most as strong as Marquis Falling Star. If I team up with the Great Zhou King, we can subdue him instantly! Where can he run?"

Even one-on-one, he could take him down, but he feared unexpected events.

However, with the Great Zhou King, there would be no surprises.

Su Yu smiled, "We shouldn't underestimate the Upper Realm experts, especially humans. After fleeing for so many years and occupying dangerous places, they certainly have the skills to escape!"

Lantian's smile was bright, "Isn't Emperor Yu here? No matter what, capturing him shouldn't be a problem!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "If the information is accurate, there should be no problem. Under Marquis Dingjun, there are over 20 Eternals, and below the Eternal level, there are about a thousand people. If there are no other Daofuse Realm experts, capturing him won't be difficult."

Quite a few Eternals.

Over 20 of them!

Previously, many had been sent down, meaning that under one Marquis Dingjun, the number of Eternals was comparable to the Lower Realm's human Eternals.

Which was normal!

After all, the Lower Realm had only risen for a few hundred years, while the Upper Realm had existed from ancient times until now without completely extinguishing its legacy.

It's just that the weak have become fewer and fewer. Firstly, because they often have to move and flee, delaying the continuation of their lineage. The weak also tend to drag others down, and in the event of a major war, the weak are the first to die.

Over the years, there have been many strong ones, but fewer weak ones.

If this continues, in a few more years, when all those below the Eternal level have died, the human race will be nearly extinct.

Can a few old fellows still pass on a race?

Su Yu tapped the chair and smiled, "Alright, let's capture Marquis Dingjun first!"

Lanshan hurriedly interjected, "Sir, there's no need for this! If you truly come from the human race, we can go back and tell the Marquis, and he will certainly treat you with respect, without any conflict!"

He couldn't understand why, if they were humans, they needed to capture the Marquis?

This... this was clearly a method used against enemies.

Were these people really humans?

He was now starting to doubt, feeling a bit terrified. Who exactly were these people?

Emperor Yu?

Great Ming King?

Great Zhou King?

Where did these emperors come from!

Su Yu chuckled lightly, "Capture first, then talk, to avoid any mishaps. Rest assured, if there's no problem, we naturally won't do anything to Marquis Dingjun. It's just a precaution, after all... you can never truly know someone!"

Treating the Upper Realm humans as traitors first was no problem.

Capture first, then discern!

Without saying more, Su Yu glanced at the sky again, exhaling lightly, "Let's leave it at that. We don't need too many people; this time, we're not going for slaughter! Senior Grandstar, you and June stay here, and the others should not go out. Great Zhou King, let's go."

Lanshan couldn't hold back anymore and hurriedly said, "Esteemed ones, we are all humans. If a conflict arises, it could easily lead to casualties. Since we are of the same race, why must we kill each other?"

He was worried about the Marquis having problems and also worried that these people would cause slaughter.

Su Yu said nothing, waving his hand, and the two men's voices disappeared. In Su Yu's hand appeared some invisible chains, locking their power of the dao.

In the Upper Realm, it felt easier to use the power of the dao.

Su Yu's eyes were peculiar; he hadn't actually seen the River of Time!

But, it might be far away, indicating that the power of the River of Time had spread to the Upper Realm, but the Upper Realm might be like the Death Realm, perhaps with only one focal point.

Yet, these people could cultivate the power of laws.

There was something wrong with the dao of the Upper Realm.

Of course, now wasn't the time to delve into it.

Cultivating in the Upper Realm might be simpler because the power of the River of Time wasn't strong, lacking a suppressive force. Whether opening a dao or merging a dao, both required resisting the suppressive force of the River of Time.

Here, there was no such feeling.

Su Yu and the others actually felt much more relaxed, with a sense of the dao boiling. No wonder many people were unwilling to stay in the Lower Realm and came up instead.

But coming up, is it really a good thing?

Su Yu remained skeptical!

The Upper Realm's experts might have greater destructive power, able to use more of the power of the dao.

However, there was a faint sense of something being hollow.

"Lacking the suppression and refinement of the River of Time?"

"But cultivating here is indeed simpler."

"For those needing to break through bottlenecks, it's a good thing."

"But there are also drawbacks..."

There are benefits, but also drawbacks.

Thinking of these, Su Yu looked at those guarding and said, "Before I return, even if you feel like you're about to break through, don't do it. This place has too weak a suppressive force on the dao, and once you break through, the commotion will be huge!"

He understood why no one in the human race had broken through to the Daofuse Realm.

It's like lighting a lamp in the dark; breaking through here would certainly cause a big commotion!

The suppressive force on the dao is too small, and the phenomenon of breaking through would be significant.

"Understood!"

Everyone responded in unison.

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King and the others, smiling, "Then, let's go for a walk!"

"Alright!"

Su Yu, Lantian, the Great Zhou King, and the Great Ming King all disappeared from their original spots.

Bringing the Great Ming King was also to set up formations, to prevent too much commotion and being discovered by others.

...

Bright Moon Flower Valley, one of the dangerous places in the Upper Realm.

As the name suggests, there were many flowers here. 

A sea of flowers!

It was called Bright Moon Flower Valley because at night, flowers resembling bright moons would appear, emitting light. Anyone illuminated by this light would show signs of poisoning.

The poison was potent, even Daofuse Realm experts could easily fall victim.

The Upper Realm was actually considered a wild, undeveloped land, so there were many dangerous places.

Even after all these years, the dangerous places hadn't been cleared because of the lack of rulers of laws. Some dangerous places even housed powerful beings that could easily trap a Heavenly King!

Over time, these dangerous places became places everyone avoided, and unless absolutely necessary, people wouldn't come here.

The human race occupied dangerous places because they had no other choice.

The more dangerous a place, the more they would go there to avoid being hunted by powerful beings.

The various races had besieged the human race for many years, and the human race hadn't killed many. Most of the losses were due to alarming some terrifying beings in these dangerous places, causing heavy losses to the various races, forcing them to retreat.

Of course, despite this, the human race didn't have it easy. Every large-scale siege resulted in significant losses for the human race, and over the years, their living space had become smaller and smaller.

At this moment, in the Bright Moon Flower Valley.

Countless enormous flowers were blooming with a faint glow; it was already nighttime.

These flowers were terrifyingly large.

Some were as big as a giant mountain.

Some were blooming, while others were closed.

Countless flowers emitted a glow, and in the void, it seemed as if an extra bright moon had appeared; this was the Bright Moon Flower Valley.

And among these countless flowers, in one of the closed giant flowers, lived many humans. This was Marquis Dingjun's hiding place. For the myriad races to attack, they first had to find his presence among these countless flowers.

Once found, they had to be careful of the nearby large flowers attacking them.

If a battle broke out, they also had to be cautious of the battle attracting more powerful flowers that would devour all strong beings.

Of course, this ghostly place was also very dangerous. To explore this place, Marquis Dingjun had spent countless years, lost many people, and had been injured several times before finally finding a flower suitable for living.

This flower could close.

At night, Marquis Dingjun could control the flower to close, preventing the outside bright moon from shining in and avoiding his subordinates being poisoned to death.

The flower's disc was large enough for over a thousand people to live on.

Marquis Dingjun had been stationed here for over 80 years, and a small town-like structure had even been built on the flower disc.

According to past practices, they must change locations every hundred years at most!

Otherwise, a hundred years would be enough for the myriad races to figure out their situation. Generally, it's best to change places every 50 years, but the human race had no choice. Each time they moved, it was a huge loss.

Dragging it out to a hundred years was the best they could do.

At this moment, on the flower disc, there were still some people coming and going in the small town.

There were old and young.

Having settled here for 80 years, some new generations of humans had been born, which made Marquis Dingjun extremely happy, even more so than having Eternals among his subordinates.

Under his command, when the ninth tide had just ended, there were still hundreds of thousands of humans.

However, over thousands of years, there were only about a thousand left!

Now, the most urgent issue wasn't the lack of strong ones, but the decreasing number of new generations, so few that in the past 80 years, only over 80 new lives had been born, which was what worried Marquis Dingjun the most.

If this continues, there's no need for the myriad races to besiege them.

After a few more relocations, he might have no one left under his command.

Recently, there seemed to be signs of the myriad races taking action again in the Bright Moon Flower Valley, which worried him even more. If this continues, he would have to find a way to move again. Sending people to the Lower Realm was also a futile effort.

The Hope for the Lower Realm

The Marquis of Dingjun hoped for some commotion in the lower realm to draw the attention of the myriad races. He wasn't entirely clear on the specifics, but he had heard that the myriad races seemed to have withdrawn from the Bright Moon Flower Valley recently. His sources were limited, but it seemed something had happened among the myriad races, leading to the deaths of several powerful beings in the lower realm, which had incited their wrath. They were now discussing how to deal with the humans of the lower realm.

Outside, night had fallen. Yet, within the flowers, it was still quite bright. The Marquis of Dingjun, clad in armor, walked along the streets of the small town. On either side were simple huts, not luxurious, just enough for people to live in and have a place to meditate.

A few people followed behind him as he patrolled. Patrolling was a daily necessity. First, it reassured the soldiers. Second, it allowed for a headcount. Third, it proved that the Marquis of Dingjun was still present.

Counting heads was crucial here, as there was always the concern that some humans might not be able to endure and choose to betray them. This wasn't the first time such a thing had happened. The humans had been oppressed for so long that some couldn't resist the temptation and chose to flee. Simply fleeing was one thing, but the fear was that they might defect to the myriad races, leading them to launch an assault.

After the ninth tide had just ended, some powerful beings had neglected this, resulting in defections that brought the myriad races down upon them, causing the deaths of many strong individuals. The Marquis of Dingjun couldn't forget such a lesson from the past.

From one end of the street to the other, the number of people remained constant, which was a relief. The Marquis of Dingjun exhaled softly and murmured, "I wonder how things are in the lower realm?"

Behind him, several equally ancient figures shared his concern. Upon hearing his words, an elderly man with white hair spoke softly, "My lord, there's no need to worry. Since the myriad races are discussing how to deal with the lower realm, it’s clear that the lower realm hasn't completely fallen yet."

The Marquis of Dingjun nodded slightly and walked towards his residence. Ahead was a simple large house, which served as his marquisate.

As he walked, he said, "The fall of Mount Min... I didn't foresee it. What worries me most is whether our intelligence has been compromised after Mount Min's fall."

He was troubled. "Mount Min was our core contact point, our hiding place. Mount Min knew all our locations. Mount Min probably wouldn't expose us, but I'm afraid... he might have told some of his subordinates, and if someone betrays us, all our locations could be exposed."

"A few days ago, a group of the myriad races suddenly arrived at the Bright Moon Flower Valley... that's what worries me the most!"

"If it doesn't work out, we'll have to evacuate!"

The Marquis of Dingjun spoke with resignation. The white-haired elder also said solemnly, "My lord, if we evacuate now and relocate, we can only find another perilous place. Each relocation is a huge loss. Out of these thousand people... how many will survive to the next perilous place?"

Relocating to a perilous place wasn't simple. If it were, they would have moved long ago. With the death of Marquis Min, they should have moved. Not moving was also due to the concern that another relocation might leave few survivors.

The Marquis of Dingjun wore a bitter expression. "In the past, how glorious we humans were! The myriad races bowed, the heavens and earth revered us, living and dead spirits alike respected us!"

"Father, you're saying that again!"

A young woman emerged from the large house, a hint of helplessness in her voice. "We haven't experienced any of that. Father, you should stop saying these things! You say it every time, and my ears are getting calloused. We're being hunted everywhere now, and I've never even left the Bright Moon Flower Valley."

The Marquis of Dingjun's eyes revealed a trace of sorrow. Yes, this was his daughter. Born thirty years ago. To continue the lineage and heritage of the human race, after his son died in battle, he settled in the Bright Moon Flower Valley for years and had another daughter. Being his daughter, her talent was naturally exceptional. At just thirty years old, she had already reached the peak of the Sunmoon Realm. But... she had never left the Bright Moon Flower Valley. Her world was only as big as the Bright Moon Flower Valley!

She had only heard of the ancient glory, never experienced it, never seen it. She didn't know how powerful the human race once was! The myriad races bowed! A place of pilgrimage! He was an ancient marquis, a strong figure among the ancient humans. Even the emperors of the myriad races had to treat him with respect.

"We will go out!"

The Marquis of Dingjun thought to himself, smiling as he said, "We will! The human race will rise again! We've endured for a hundred thousand years and have never been extinguished! His Majesty the Human Emperor, Lord Culture King, they will all return!"

He said this, but in his heart, he had long despaired. A hundred thousand years! If they could return, they would have done so long ago. He didn't believe those incredibly powerful beings were dead, but... now he had no choice but to believe. If they weren't dead, after a hundred thousand years, they should have returned!

The young woman didn't take it seriously. For countless years, her father had always said this. She had also heard it from some elders. At this moment, she didn't shatter her father's illusion and smiled, "Father, let's not talk about this now. Can you manifest the Sea of Stars for me tonight? Last time I caught a glimpse, it was so beautiful. Is the sea really like that? So beautiful!"

Over the years, the Marquis of Dingjun would manifest some ancient places for her, showing her what the outside world was like. The Sea of Stars... The Marquis of Dingjun smiled and nodded, "Alright! The Sea of Stars... it's an extremely beautiful place! There are countless races there, countless realm entrances, countless legends, countless myths... and of course, the love story of Lord Radiant King."

Beside him, the white-haired elder chuckled, "My lord, you've told the story of Lord Radiant King countless times."

The Marquis of Dingjun laughed, "When mentioning the Sea of Stars, one must mention Lord Radiant King! That unparalleled power, suspending the Sea of Stars for millions of years without falling... all for the smile of the Radiant King's Consort... truly enviable!"

This time, the young woman didn't interrupt. She enjoyed listening to these stories. She was tired of the fighting and killing. In her thirty years, there had been battles, and each time, people left and never returned! A group of people who watched her grow up had left before, and perhaps... they would never return. Such days were too exhausting. Listening to her father talk about the gossip of ancient strong figures was her happiest time. As for glory and splendor, those didn't matter. No matter how glorious, it was all in the past. A hundred thousand years were enough to bury everything.

...

At the same moment the Marquis of Dingjun was telling his daughter about the Sea of Stars, outside the Bright Moon Flower Valley, the space rippled slightly.

Su Yu focused his gaze, seeing countless flowers filling the entire world. The massive gorge was filled with flowers, and above the gorge, a bright moon hung, incredibly beautiful. But also incredibly dangerous!

With his Heaven Gate open, Su Yu looked into the gorge and frowned slightly, "This place is even more dangerous than the Soul Burying Mountain! These flowers are all cultivating, walking the same path."

As Su Yu spoke, he suddenly glanced around, raising an eyebrow, "The Marquis of Dingjun is being watched!"

With those words, three small doors imprinted themselves on the foreheads of the three people with him.

In an instant, they too saw the faint lines around them.

Lantian laughed charmingly, "Indeed, there are a few little bugs! But there's only one Daofuse, and three Eternals. It seems they're not ready to make a move yet."

If they were truly ready to act, one Daofuse wouldn't be enough. However, since a Daofuse was present, it was likely they had confirmed the Marquis of Dingjun's location and could launch an attack at any moment. These people were stationed outside the flower valley, likely to prevent the Marquis of Dingjun from escaping.

The Great Ming King also smiled, "So, if we hadn't come, the Marquis of Dingjun might have perished! By coming, we've actually saved him?"

"That seems to be the case!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Let's take them down first. These guys aren't in the flower valley, so they're easier to deal with. That Daofuse is only around the fifth rank!"

Trash! Among those present, only the Great Ming King was about as strong as the opponent. The others were much stronger.

"Great Ming King, you handle the three Eternals. The three of us will take down the opponent instantly. Let's not make any noise to avoid alerting the Marquis of Dingjun. Great Zhou King, it's up to you!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "I still need the Emperor Yu to join me for absolute certainty!"

Su Yu also had the power of the Bewitching Dao. The two of them working together against a fifth-rank Daofuse would almost certainly succeed.

Lantian, however, laughed eerily, "Where does that leave me? Let's go. If we keep talking, my countless brothers and sisters won't be able to hold back!"

"…"

Speechless.

The group chuckled lightly, relaxed but not careless. They concealed all their auras. Being new arrivals, it was best to be cautious.

...

Outside the flower valley.

A demon race expert looked into the distance, frowning slightly. Behind him, three Eternal experts looked at the Daofuse realm being and someone whispered, "My lord, is there any movement?"

"It's nothing."

The demon god still frowned, "Just a slight spatial ripple earlier, perhaps caused by some rule fluctuation..."

The group probed around but detected nothing unusual. As for any sense of danger, there was none. The Daofuse realm demon god felt a slight sense of crisis but couldn't pinpoint its source after careful probing. Could it be that the Marquis of Dingjun had discovered them? If he had, he wouldn't dare to confront them, and escape was more likely.

The demon god took a deep breath, "If the Marquis of Dingjun attempts to escape, send a message immediately and encircle him! Our task isn't to engage in battle but to monitor and prevent them from escaping silently!"

Using a Daofuse as a lookout showed how seriously the myriad races regarded these remnant humans.

"Understood!"

The three nodded. They didn't want to engage these desperate individuals in battle. As long as the Marquis of Dingjun dared to emerge, they could immediately send a message and have a large number of experts come to kill them!

As they spoke, a voice suddenly laughed in their ears, "Gentlemen, shh! Keep quiet, let's have a chat."

The three Eternals were instantly ensnared.

The demon god's expression changed drastically!

Who?

In a moment of distraction, another playful voice sounded in his ear, "Don't speak, good baby, I love you!"

"Stay quiet, and you'll live!"

Three formidable experts simultaneously activated the power of their daos, disrupting the fifth-tier Daofuse expert. On the periphery, the Great Ming King's formation descended instantly, sealing off the surroundings. The three Eternal experts had long been lost in confusion. The gap was simply too vast!

The demon god's eyes flickered with intense struggle. Just as it seemed he might break free, countless figures of Lantian, both male and female, appeared around him, transforming into a massive net. They giggled, "Be good, darling. The world loves you, and you love the world. Don't move around!"

The Great Zhou King stepped forward, his smile gentle. "Hold on, don't speak, don't struggle. We're here to save you!"

The demon god's heart wavered. No, this isn't right! These are enemies!

In the next moment, Su Yu appeared, a pen materializing in his hand. With a single stroke, countless characters emerged: Seal, Lock, Capture, Suppress...

As the pen tip touched down, the demon god's physical form shattered instantly. In the blink of an eye, only the Mark of Civilization remained, its pages sealing the West King's Consort. The lower page swept up the four opponents, devouring them in an instant!

No lives were taken to avoid causing too much commotion. The Sanctification Seal descended, suppressing everything instantly. All disturbances vanished!

The group exchanged glances, smiles spreading across their faces. A Heavenly King, two top-tier Daofuse experts, and the formation of the Great Ming King—dealing with a fifth-tier Daofuse expert was all too easy.

Su Yu chuckled, "Let's hurry and capture Marquis Dingjun before these people disappear and alert the myriad races!"

The others nodded and vanished in an instant. Since they had already made their move, they needed to act swiftly to avoid any mishaps if the myriad races tried to contact them and received no response.

...

Inside the enormous flower.

Marquis Dingjun suddenly felt a pang of unease. He glanced upwards, his expression turning grave. Just now... did something happen?
