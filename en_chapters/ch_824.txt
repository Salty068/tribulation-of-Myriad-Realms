Chapter 824: The Martial Emperor!

Did Su Yu deceive Zhou Ji? Not exactly.

The Martial Emperor was an unpredictable figure. Su Yu wasn't sure whose side he was on, but nobody could be certain that he wasn't on Su Yu's side either. During the negotiation with Zhou Ji, both parties were aware of the Martial Emperor's impending return, which made Zhou Ji anxious. Su Yu was also somewhat concerned, fearing that the Martial Emperor might suddenly return and cause trouble.

Thus, Zhou Ji was eager to reach an agreement, and Su Yu was equally eager. The Martial Emperor might fulfill his promises, or he might not. However, Su Yu had reached a point where he was unwilling to gamble on uncertainties. Why risk a sure victory for the unknown?

Therefore, he chose to force Zhou Ji and his group to leave before the Martial Emperor returned. If the Martial Emperor were guaranteed to support Su Yu, he might have chosen to keep Zhou Ji around. But due to the uncertainty, Su Yu decided to let them go.

Now, Zhou Ji and his group had departed.

The Martial Emperor had returned!

Su Yu, filled with pent-up frustration, was ready to unleash it. Now, in the myriad realms, the only one not following orders was the Martial Emperor.

"Beat him up!" Su Yu shouted, dragging the Martial Emperor into his own world. The others joined in, and at this moment, Su Yu's forces were formidable enough to take on the Martial Emperor.

The Martial Emperor's expression was quite a sight. "What are you doing? Su Yu, are you turning against me? Don't go too far..."

The Martial Emperor was anxious. There were so many people! Damn it! So many rulers of laws! What was going on? He had only been away for a short while!

Boom!

He was dragged into Su Yu's world, where everyone attacked him. Forced to retreat, he realized that within Su Yu's world, his power was suppressed, while Su Yu's side was enhanced, especially Su Yu himself.

At this moment, Su Yu was absorbing the power of fortune left by Zhou Ji, as well as the power of the human race's physical path that Zhou Ji had severed. He was still digesting everything he hadn't before.

The Human Emperor's sky was gradually dissipating, but Su Yu's strength hadn't weakened significantly. When the Human Emperor's sky covered him, Su Yu possessed the power of a second-class ruler of laws. Now, as the sky faded, Su Yu was indeed weakening, but not by much.

Strictly speaking, he seemed to still maintain a second-class level here. Of course, he was slightly weaker than before. However, if he absorbed everything he had gained, he might be about the same as before. This meant that Su Yu's gains this time could match the enhancement from the Human Emperor's sky.

It was equivalent to gaining a fragment of the sky! This was already an enormous gain, even beyond imagination. After all, where would one find so many skies to absorb?

Jokingly, while absorbing all the power, Su Yu chuckled, "Don't hit him too hard. Just play around with the Martial Emperor. After all, he's still part of the human race..."

Hearing Su Yu's words, the others didn't go all out, but they were still quite excited, eager to fight first and talk later.

Seeing this, the Martial Emperor breathed a sigh of relief, cursing, "What did I do? Wasn't I helping you deal with Zhou Ji? Now you're turning your back on me?"

Su Yu smiled without saying anything, continuing to absorb and digest.

The physical path in Su Yu's world had significantly improved this time. Both Hundred Battles and Zhou Ji were strong in the physical path. The two of them had severed the human race's physical path, and they accounted for at least a third of it. The ancient physical human kings also held a significant portion.

Only a small fraction remained for countless human cultivators to practice. Now, with the two of them severing their paths, a large amount of physical power was strengthening the physical path in Su Yu's world.

Those human experts who had previously practiced the physical path, after severing their paths, continued to integrate into Su Yu's world and practice the physical path, clearly improving significantly!

There were quite a few such cultivators. Many of the eternal human cultivators had practiced the physical path. Later, some switched paths, but others couldn't and had to continue with the physical path. Previously, the physical path in Su Yu's world was quite weak.

Up ahead, a group of people was fighting fiercely, but they weren't going for the kill. Su Yu, however, continued to absorb power relentlessly, his eyes flashing with madness, which quickly turned into calmness.

Zhou Ji had said Su Yu was crazy... but Su Yu didn't think he was. A madman wouldn't admit to being mad. I'm a scholar... how could a scholar be a madman? Madness is just for show, isn't it?

Su Yu never thought he was truly mad. He considered himself quite normal. So normal that everyone thought he was mad, but that was just because others weren't normal enough.

His strength climbed steadily. Over there, the fight was becoming a bit dull. Everyone actually wanted to calm down and reflect, but without Su Yu's orders, they had to keep fighting.

The Martial Emperor kept cursing, "What's going on?"

No one knew how long it took, but Su Yu's physical body suddenly trembled, becoming much stronger than before. At this moment, the free power of laws in his world was mostly absorbed by Su Yu, and his entire world expanded significantly once again.

Su Yu's strength, at this point, was slightly weaker than before, but the difference wasn't significant. He should still be at the level of a second-class ruler of laws. The terror of an opener of the heavens was only now becoming apparent!

Opening the heavens, two months! In two months, Su Yu had gone from the strength of a Heavenly Venerable to a second-class level. Of course, this was within his own world. In his world, Su Yu had already reached the level of some emperors of the past!

Terrifying!

The difference between a strong opener of the heavens and a weak one was now evident. A strong opener, like the Human Emperor, opened a second-class ruler of laws' sky. This sky wasn't much of a help, just an auxiliary. Only when it became powerful later could it be considered an opener of the heavens.

For a weak one, like Su Yu, opening the heavens at the Sunmoon realm with the power of a Heavenly Venerable, in a short time, this world reached the level of a second-class ruler of laws. For Su Yu, this wasn't just icing on the cake but a timely help!

Therefore, Su Yu's strength improved extremely quickly. The Human Emperor and others, when they opened the heavens, didn't get much help initially. Even if the Human Emperor opened the heavens, he wouldn't rashly sever his own path. The Human Emperor must have cultivated an extremely powerful path!

His world wasn't perfected yet. He wouldn't sever his path until it was. If he did, he'd be limited. For example, Su Yu was also limited. His world couldn't move too far. If he went out, he'd only be a third-class ruler of laws.

The Human Emperor didn't move his world because if he did, his world would be significantly weakened, even worse than Su Yu's. Su Yu had completed a small cycle, making his world self-sufficient. The Human Emperor still wanted to use the River of Time to fill his world.

"Second-class..."

Su Yu murmured. This was the combat strength of figures like the Radiant King at the end of the ancient era. Of course, they might have been at the peak of second-class, but it should be considered the same level.

However, countless years had passed. Even if they hadn't reached 100,000 years in the River of Time, with constant battles and struggles, directly absorbing the power of laws from the River of Time, Su Yu believed these people should have improved.

"They might have all reached first-class!"

"Even the War King, who was third-class, might have reached second-class..."

Su Yu speculated, and it seemed highly likely.

So, if he left his world, he'd only be third-class. If he went upstream, would a third-class ruler of laws be of much help?

Moreover, in his world, a group of people were now rulers of laws, but outside, they'd only be considered fifth-class rulers of laws. Normally, fourth-class was the standard, and fifth-class were just some weak physical path human kings or those who mastered a small path.

That's the strength of Moon Battle, Chaos Dragon, and others, defined as fifth-class rulers of laws by the Human Emperor back then.

They could fight Heavenly Venerables, even kill them, but fighting rulers of laws was extremely difficult.

Su Yu pondered continuously, and at this moment, his aura gradually stabilized.

Not far away, the Martial Emperor was actually quite powerful. Su Yu even vaguely sensed that after being sealed for many years, upon release, the Martial Emperor might soon advance. Even after years of slumber and madness, his path had been actively absorbing power.

Second-class might be close.

Reaching second-class, this guy would still be the number one in the myriad realms outside Su Yu's world!

So, the Martial Emperor wasn't worried, cursing but not anxious. Seeing Su Yu's attitude, he knew Su Yu wasn't planning to oppose him.

...

However, at this moment, Su Yu's eyes flickered.

The Martial Emperor... was a problem!

Previously unsealing the Martial Emperor was a deliberate move by Su Yu to create suspense, making Hundred Battles, the myriad races, and the Sin Clan unsure if the Martial Emperor was on Su Yu's side. In fact, this move succeeded!

Very successfully!

No one believed that Su Yu would unseal the Martial Emperor without any plan, because everyone thought Su Yu was incredibly smart!

And Su Yu used this tactic to make everyone wary of approaching or trusting the Martial Emperor!

This was the gamble!

But clearly, Su Yu won the gamble. Even someone as smart as Zhou Ji was fooled by Su Yu!

The Martial Emperor going to find him was actually Su Yu's constant persuasion and instigation.

On the first day of the Martial Emperor's release, Su Yu warned him not to go to the Chaos, as there was a number one person in the world there. If he went, he might be killed!

For a martial man like the Martial Emperor, he had to test Zhou Ji's strength unless he was sure the opponent was truly strong and hard to defeat.

And Zhou Ji, being a smart person, obviously didn't want to fight the Martial Emperor, so he used a strategy to shake him off... and this was the result Su Yu wanted!

In fact, this result was very much to his liking.

However, now, the Martial Emperor's usefulness was gone, and he had become an obstacle to Su Yu's unification of the myriad realms!

The next moment, Su Yu's gaze regained its calm.

What I need is an unyielding Myriad Realms!

What I need is a peaceful rear.

He wasn't afraid of much, but he feared that after taking away a large number of experts, some unforeseen event might occur, leading to the extinction of the Human Race. Even someone as reckless as the Hundred Battle King hadn't led the Human Race to extinction. If under Su Yu's leadership, the race were to decline and perish, he would feel more useless than the Hundred Battle King!

At this moment, Su Yu stood up.

...

The Martial Emperor was still cursing, fighting and swearing at the same time.

"You little bugs, are you seeking death?"

"Still fighting?"

"If I weren't too lazy to kill you, you'd be dead already..."

The others couldn't be bothered to respond.

Just then, Su Yu approached, smiling, "Martial Emperor, Senior!"

The Martial Emperor glanced at him, annoyed, "Get these little bugs out of here, they're annoying!"

"Senior... still as arrogant as ever!"

Su Yu chuckled, and the Martial Emperor suddenly felt something was off. Su Yu's smile... suddenly gave him a sense of unease, a warrior's instinct of impending danger!

Su Yu chuckled lightly, "I don't have much animosity towards the Martial Emperor. However... I'm about to leave the Myriad Realms soon, to assist the Human Emperor. Perhaps the Martial Emperor won't go, nor help, because... there's enmity between you."

"Helping one's enemy is an unpleasant task. If it were me, I wouldn't want to either!"

"Empathizing with others, someone as proud as the Martial Emperor probably wouldn't want to help either..."

The Martial Emperor suddenly felt a chill in his heart!

Around them, the Great Zhou King and other wise individuals also had a change in expression.

"Thank you, Martial Emperor, for holding off Zhou Ji and scaring him... This act repays the favor of me unsealing you, so I owe you nothing, and you owe me nothing!"

The Martial Emperor's expression completely changed.

The Great Zhou King and others instantly waved their hands, retreating behind Su Yu. At this moment, the Great Zhou King looked at Su Yu with a serious and questioning gaze, no longer playful.

Su Yu chuckled, "The Martial Emperor still has some sense of belonging to the Human Race... You're not a traitor like the Hundred Battle King, so I have some respect for you!"

"As a senior, in this battle, I will give it my all to leave you with dignity, to send you off with honor!"

Opposite him, the Martial Emperor's face turned ashen as he looked at Su Yu without speaking.

He understood!

Su Yu... intended to kill him!

Su Yu flicked his robe, which transformed into a golden robe. The Human Lord Seal appeared, transforming into a crown that adorned Su Yu's head. A book materialized in his hand, the Mark of Civilization, which was essentially the core of this world.

Su Yu looked at the Martial Emperor and said calmly, "Luminous Domain Mansion, Su Yu! Today, here, I send off the Martial Emperor, Senior! This is not a battle of the Dao, nor a punishment for a traitor, but simply because I do not wish for the Martial Emperor to become an obstacle! This is the act of a Human Lord, unrelated to morality or legacy, but purely to prevent future troubles!"

To execute the Martial Emperor!

This was Su Yu's decision!

The Martial Emperor had become the most unstable factor on his side!

Killing the Martial Emperor was a thought Su Yu had entertained from the start. Later, he felt it unnecessary, as the Martial Emperor was merely an unlucky brute, a reckless warrior...

But at this point, Su Yu wasn't acting out of personal likes or dislikes, but for the greater good!

Sometimes, there are things you don't want to do, but you must do them!

The Martial Emperor's expression completely changed!

Su Yu was truly prepared to kill him!

Behind him, the Great Zhou King hesitated to speak, and others also showed slight changes in expression. Even the warriors like Wu Ji had a slight change in their expressions. Just moments ago, everyone thought it was a joke, and Su Yu seemed to be joking, but at this moment... Su Yu wasn't joking.

He intended to execute the Martial Emperor!

Opposite him, the Martial Emperor's expression was grave, "You want to kill me?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "I will give the Martial Emperor, Senior, dignity. In this battle, I will fight the Martial Emperor, Senior, alone. In my life, there are people I can use, but rarely do I fight alone. I've always believed that those who use their minds don't need to exert themselves... But today, I give the Martial Emperor this honor!"

The Martial Emperor's mouth twitched, "Well... thank you! Su Yu, you're even more ruthless than the Human Emperor and the others!"

"Not quite."

Su Yu smiled, a smile as warm as a spring breeze, "If I were truly ruthless, I would have surrounded and killed the Martial Emperor by now!"

Su Yu walked towards him step by step, speaking softly, "Let me witness the might of the ancient overlord, the Martial Emperor!"

The Martial Emperor's expression grew solemn.

Gradually, he felt Su Yu's aura growing stronger, suppressing and oppressing him. The Martial Emperor's pupils contracted; Su Yu was absurdly strong!

Vaguely, he even felt a resemblance to the Culture King of the past, who could kill a ruler of laws with a single stroke. He was in a daze, as if seeing the Culture King of old, smiling brightly, striking down a wild beast with a single stroke, a ruler of laws!

Today's Su Yu didn't quite resemble the Culture King in temperament, but his smile, his actions, and the way he looked at him were very much like the Culture King of old, striking down a wild beast!

The Martial Emperor's expression grew increasingly grave, and gradually, a long spear appeared in his hand!

The spear was like a dragon, seemingly roaring!

The Martial Emperor stopped cursing, carrying a heavy demeanor, and said in a low voice, "If you want to kill me, you must show your skill! Su Yu, your progress terrifies me, but... I am the Martial Emperor, born for martial prowess. To kill me, you must pay a price!"

He felt the terror!

Su Yu's progress was unimaginably fast!

But... he was the Martial Emperor!

An emperor born for martial prowess!

The spear trembled, the sound of air explosions shaking the heavens and earth. At this moment, the Martial Emperor, with strength similar to Yu's earlier, perhaps slightly stronger, wielded the spear with such focus that he seemed noticeably stronger than Yu!

The Martial Emperor said coldly, "Then let this emperor witness the power of the new generation's Human Emperor!"

"Battle!"

With a low shout, the spear pierced through the heavens, boom!

A sound like an explosion, and with a puff, countless people behind were sent flying, each spitting blood, utterly shocked!

The Martial Emperor's aura erupted, filled with madness, intense battle intent, killing intent, and a bloody aura. He was the Martial Emperor!

In the chaotic ancient times, he slaughtered all around, quelled chaos, and suppressed an era!

Back then, the Human Race was in chaos, fighting against the Human Race, against the Myriad Realms, against the myriad races. He was one of the top three ancient human emperors!

He was not like Yu!

Yu, seemingly a warrior, was actually always hidden in the shadows, rarely making a move, unlike him, who grew up in battle before being sealed.

And Su Yu, flipping through the pages of the book in his hand, a phantom appeared, colliding with the spear!

Boom!

A loud explosion, the spear directly pinned the Demon Ancestor to the void. The Martial Emperor's aura was fierce, coldly saying, "Demon Ancestor? I've never seen the Demon Ancestor, but I've seen the previous Demon Emperor, and not only seen... I pinned him to the Demon Realm. You think you can kill me with demonic ways? Too naive!"

These words revealed some secrets.

Not really, during the ancient times, he fought everywhere, slaughtered everywhere. What was a Demon Emperor to him? He was one of the human emperors, pinning a Demon Emperor was nothing!

The spearhead trembled, and with a rumble, the Demon Ancestor's body exploded!

The Martial Emperor withdrew his spear, instantly retreating, and behind him, the Immortal Ancestor appeared.

"Su Yu, these methods are too naive, too weak!"

The Martial Emperor sneered, swinging his spear, sweeping across the heavens, piercing through the heavens, the spear stirring, shaking Su Yu's world!

...

"So strong!"

At this moment, even the Great Qin King couldn't help but be shocked, transmitting, "Old Zhou, the Martial Emperor and that Yu earlier, are they of similar realms?"

Why did it feel like he was much stronger than Yu earlier!

"Purest in martial prowess!"

The Great Zhou King was somewhat complex, transmitting, "The Martial Emperor is an ancient human emperor who fought his way out! He's not like Yu, a bloodline powerhouse hiding in the shadows! In the late ancient times, the Myriad Realms were in chaos, and only in such chaotic times did heroes emerge, did the Human Emperor and others emerge! So in this chaotic world, those who made a name for themselves, who could be called emperors, how could there be weaklings! The Martial Emperor was defeated by the Martial King, but the Martial King... was known as the third strongest in the Myriad Realms!"

The first in the Myriad Realms was still the Human Emperor or the Culture King, it's hard to say. These two were first and second, the Martial King was known as the third, and neither the Control King nor the Radiant King denied it or said anything, perhaps out of disdain, or perhaps the Martial King was indeed stronger than them!

Everyone thought the Martial Emperor was too miserable, suppressed by the Martial King, but they didn't consider whether ordinary people even had the qualifications to be suppressed by the Martial King.

Even Zhou Ji, in reality, was very strong, a third-class peak, yet he didn't dare to fight the Martial Emperor in chaos, instead shaking him off, showing considerable apprehension.

The Great Qin King also used a spear, and at this moment, watching the Martial Emperor also use a spear, and Yu earlier also used a spear, he couldn't help but take a few more glances.

The more he watched, the more shocked he became!

The Martial Emperor was truly powerful!

He seemed loud and boisterous, but every spear strike was at the optimal moment, without any waste of combat power, each spear strike was incredibly exquisite, his combat experience, combat instincts, were absurdly strong!

"Does His Majesty really intend to kill him?"

The Great Qin King was still somewhat conflicted, the Martial Emperor didn't seem to be opposing everyone.

The Great Zhou King sighed, transmitting, "There's no choice, His Majesty hopes for the Myriad Realms to remain peaceful, not to descend into chaos once he leaves! The Martial Emperor has become the greatest hidden danger..."

"But he could be banished behind the Gate of Hell..."

"The Martial Emperor wouldn't agree!"

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "He's a pure warrior. If you let him go behind the Heaven Gate to seek revenge on the Martial King, he might go. But if you let him go behind the Gate of Hell... he probably wouldn't go!"

Alright!

The Great Qin King didn't know what to say either. As the commander of the Human Race for the past few hundred years, he knew how troublesome an existence like the Martial Emperor could be.

It's just... he still felt the crime didn't warrant death.

He glanced at Su Yu, who remained as cold as ever, flipping through the pages of a book. Suddenly, a sigh escaped his heart. Forget it. Su Yu... he vaguely felt that Su Yu had become somewhat deranged. But it was the times that had driven him to this state.

If Su Yu had continued his studies, becoming a researcher, perhaps he wouldn't have turned out this way. Yet, his experiences from childhood had driven him to madness. His studies hadn't quelled his frenzy, and soon, he found himself embroiled in endless wars, despair crashing over him time and again.

Today, Su Yu was completely consumed by madness. He was insane!

The Great Qin King had somewhat sensed it. Perhaps others hadn't noticed anything, or didn't think much of it, but the Great Qin King could vaguely feel it. Because the Su Yu of today was different from the Su Yu who first entered the Allheaven Battlefield!

When Su Yu first entered the Allheaven Battlefield, the Great Qin King had observed him once. Back then, although Su Yu was somewhat extreme, his emotions were visible on his face. He wasn't as capricious as he was now!

...

While others were watching the battle, Su Yu snorted coldly and shouted, "I command the heavens and earth, the martial path shall perish!"

"Perish!"

With a low shout, a page of the book vanished instantly. The Martial Emperor thrust his spear, suddenly feeling his battle intent wane. In the next moment, a fierce glint flashed in his eyes. "The martial path shall perish? Such arrogance! Martial arts reside in the heart! I am the Martial Emperor, my heart is solely for martial arts!"

Su Yu could control rules, but he couldn't control the human heart!

In my heart, there is martial arts!

That martial spirit will not perish!

Boom!

The battle intent surged even more. In an instant, the Martial Emperor's aura soared. I may be foolish, but I know what I pursue. What I pursue is strength, is the martial path!

Perhaps Su Yu thought him foolish, thought he wasted his talent, but the Martial Emperor didn't care.

Talent is talent. How many can truly turn talent into strength?

At least, I am still strong!

The spear trembled, lacking intricate techniques, without the 720 divine skills of Yu and Hundred Battles, just this single spear!

Unyielding, kill!

Charge!

He advanced step by step towards Su Yu, each step closer, each spear strike shattering Su Yu's relentless lethal techniques!

"Kill!"

The roars were unending, yet Su Yu's strength was indeed superior, especially within his own domain. The suppression of the heavens and earth, the myriad rules unleashed, all sorts of methods deployed!

Sweat dripped from Su Yu's forehead, yet he remained unmoved like a mountain!

The Mark of Civilization was flipped open page by page.

One Su Yu after another emerged, quickly surrounding the Martial Emperor. Countless Su Yus, each wielding different powers of laws, engaged in fierce combat with the Martial Emperor!

The Martial Emperor's heavy breathing gradually became apparent.

He was strong!

But here, he couldn't defeat Su Yu.

Outside, perhaps there was still a chance, but here, there was none.

The Martial Emperor's steps grew heavy. After slaying a group of Su Yus, leaving corpses strewn across the battlefield, those corpses quickly dissipated into the heavens and earth. The Martial Emperor panted heavily, Su Yu was very close!

Get close to Su Yu, kill him!

A warrior is not to be trifled with!

The Martial Emperor bared his teeth, revealing bright and chilling teeth, roaring once more as he swung his spear, charging at the Su Yus blocking his path!

The way of the world, martial arts are the fiercest!

Spear path?

No, he walked the martial path!

All killing moves are martial!

What he learned was the art of killing!

With a thunderous crash, the spear shattered. The Martial Emperor spat blood but ignored it, discarding the spear, throwing a punch that tore a Su Yu apart, transforming his fist into a palm, splitting another Su Yu in half!

All martial arts are for killing!

The Martial Emperor chuckled coldly, "Without a spear in hand, I can still kill! Su Yu, you're still too green!"

He twisted and snapped the bones of a Su Yu, turning him into a pretzel!

Su Yu's expression remained calm, continuing to flip through the pages, as more Su Yus flew out from him, sweat flowing beneath his feet.

The Martial Emperor was strong!

Strong enough that he might truly contend with a second-tier, which was why he could battle the Martial King back then. But strong as he was, he was not a second-tier, only able to fight.

Opposite him, the Martial Emperor continued his slaughter!

The rules of the great path trembled!

However, his aura was also declining. After killing so many, his consumption was too great. Even the power from the River of Time couldn't replenish it. For a strong practitioner of the rules of the great path, it wasn't easy to exhaust the power of laws, but in Su Yu's domain, the power of laws reflected from the River of Time was less than usual!

Gradually, the Martial Emperor grew weaker.

With a thunderous boom!

The Martial Emperor roared, charging headlong, smashing a Su Yu into pieces!

At this moment, he was only a hundred meters away from Su Yu!

For the strong, this was a distance that could be covered in the blink of an eye.

Practically face to face!

The Martial Emperor's forehead was covered in blood and sweat, the sweat obscuring his eyes. Opposite him, Su Yu sighed, "Very strong, the martial path is not weak! More refined than Hundred Battles and the others!"

Specialized!

The Martial Emperor's understanding of the martial path was thorough, and combined with his strong talent, his combat prowess was indeed stronger than those like Hundred Battles who were distracted by divine skills.

As the words fell, Su Yu and the Martial Emperor erupted simultaneously!

The Martial Emperor roared, kicking out with a foot that shattered the void!

And Su Yu, his palm like jade!

With one hand, he grabbed the Martial Emperor's foot, his fingers piercing through with a squelch, piercing the Martial Emperor's foot, while the Martial Emperor roared, kicking out with a foot that shattered Su Yu's hand.

Su Yu remained cold, swiftly sidestepping, engaging in fierce combat with the Martial Emperor in the void!

The exhausted Martial Emperor, with his rich combat experience, dodged and evaded, his legs and fists striking, causing Su Yu to cough up blood repeatedly. Yet Su Yu, ultimately stronger, in the blink of an eye, with a thunderous boom!

The Martial Emperor was knocked back for the first time, his throat gouged out with a bloody hole!

Su Yu pressed his advantage, instantly closing in, his hand forming an eagle claw, tearing out a chunk of flesh with a squelch. The Martial Emperor retreated continuously, while Su Yu relentlessly suppressed him!

At this moment, the two were engaged in close combat, Su Yu's moves were ruthless, the rules of the great path clashing, constantly suppressing the Martial Emperor, forcing him to retreat, coughing up blood, new wounds constantly appearing on his body!

The Martial Emperor showed a hint of despair.

He couldn't defeat Su Yu!

In Su Yu's domain, he couldn't defeat Su Yu, even if he slaughtered countless Su Yu clones, those clones would eventually recover, while he himself, if continued to be suppressed here, would be slain by Su Yu!

Behind him, the spectators were all solemn.

Reaching the point of close combat meant Su Yu... was going to kill!

Su Yu had exhausted most of the Martial Emperor's strength, and he himself had also consumed a lot!

But since Su Yu chose to engage closely, and hadn't asked for help until now, it meant he was confident in a kill!

Everyone felt complicated.

The Martial Emperor, after all, was human.

Although he didn't get along with the Martial King and others, to say he betrayed them wasn't accurate. It was just that both sides were human rulers, choosing conflict for the sake of human supremacy, which was different from Hundred Battles.

Amidst the complexity of the crowd, Su Yu let out a fierce shout, his claw piercing through the Martial Emperor's chest, while the Martial Emperor also roared fiercely, delivering a punch that shattered Su Yu's bones!

Both retreated simultaneously, Su Yu tearing out a large chunk of flesh!

The Martial Emperor coughed up blood continuously, looking at Su Yu with some helplessness. "I can't even fight you..."

Defeated!

I really couldn't defeat Su Yu!

What a tragic thing!

As for being in Su Yu's domain... he didn't say anything. Opening the heavens, that was Su Yu's ability, who told him he couldn't open the heavens.

Su Yu panted, "You're not bad, much stronger than Yu and the others!"

"Them?"

The Martial Emperor sneered, "No matter how strong a bug is, it's still just a bug!"

He seemed quite arrogant, coldly laughing, "The three gates of heaven, earth, and man, the Heaven Gate is the strongest, the hardest to open! Only those who open the Heaven Gate are the strongest, those who don't are all trash, all bugs!"

"......"

Behind him, everyone suddenly felt no sympathy for him!

Too foul-mouthed!

According to his words, in this world, there weren't many who weren't bugs!

Such arrogance, if not beaten to death by Su Yu, would eventually be killed by someone else.

Su Yu smiled, saying nothing, advancing once more, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes, his speed suddenly soaring, with a squelch, his hand forming a claw, tearing through the Martial Emperor's throat!

Blood sprayed!

The Martial Emperor retreated once more, a hint of helplessness in his eyes, too much consumption, heavy injuries, he couldn't fight Su Yu anymore!

Past his peak!

In the next moment, his aura suddenly surged, coldly saying, "I can still fight!"

At this moment, his aura surged to the extreme!

Self-detonation!

The people behind quickly retreated!

The self-detonation of someone like the Martial Emperor was not something ordinary in power.

"The Martial Emperor... has fallen!"

Wu Ji murmured softly, what a pity!

Such a top-tier expert, in the end, was still killed, sealed for hundreds of thousands of years, ultimately dying at the hands of a human emperor!

And Su Yu, his expression also solemn, quickly consolidating his domain.

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's aura surged to the extreme, suddenly shouting, "I surrender! Quickly accept, or I'll really self-detonate!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned!

Su Yu was taken aback!

The Martial Emperor shouted, "I surrender! Su Yu, don't go too far, you said before, after unsealing me, we would cooperate, be equals, now you're suddenly going back on your word, what do you mean? I surrender... at worst, I'll demote myself, I'll be the Martial King, not the Martial Emperor, you unseal that Taishan!"

"......"

Su Yu looked at him, somewhat dazed.

You're a warrior!

What... what does surrender mean?

The Martial Emperor, fierce on the outside but weak on the inside, roared, "What are you looking at, I surrender! I can't beat you, I still plan to take revenge on Taishan, I can't die now, Su Yu, what do you want, just say it, I surrender, you still want to kill me? Don't force me to self-detonate!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned.

This warrior, he... he surrendered?

What the hell is this?

Completely dumbfounded!

In their minds, even if the Martial Emperor fought to the last moment, fought to the death, he wouldn't surrender. Everyone thought he was going to self-detonate, but no, he wanted to surrender, surrendering in the strongest posture!

If not accepted, I'll self-detonate again!

Blow you all up!

Su Yu furrowed his brows, looking at him with a deep voice, "Martial Emperor..."

"Did this martial artist eat your family's rice?" The Martial Emperor roared in anger, "I just got unsealed, I've been sealed for hundreds of thousands of years! If you were sealed for hundreds of thousands of years, you wouldn't want to die either, you'd want to surrender!"

I just got out! It's only been a few days, and you want to kill me? What can I do? I'm about to go mad from being trapped for so long, and now that I've just started enjoying life, dying like this is too unfair!

Even his surrender was filled with arrogance!

"Su Yu, at worst, I'll help you kill a few more rulers of laws... Add two more, five in total, how about that?" The Martial Emperor shouted, filled with anger, as if he was truly furious!

It seemed as if Su Yu was his enemy... which wasn't far from the truth.

But his words were different, as he shouted again in anger, "Su Yu, don't go too far. I'm surrendering... Fine, the Martial King can't be sealed, then... then the Marquis of Martial will do!"

He roared once more, "Aren't you just trying to save the Human Emperor? I'll go too, alright? At worst, I won't meet with them, is that okay?"

"Su Yu, don't push it too far!"

The Martial Emperor's furious roar, his tone, his attitude, if one didn't know better, would think he was scolding Su Yu as if he were a grandson!

Su Yu looked at him blankly.

I offered you the highest courtesy!

Someone like you... I should have had people surround and kill you!

A martial artist like you has learned to be shameless, and not only that, you said the shameless words in the harshest tone!

Seeing Su Yu remain silent, the Martial Emperor grew even more anxious, shouting, "Su Yu... no, Emperor Yu, how about giving me some face? Give me some face today, take me as a subordinate, so we can meet in the future without awkwardness!"

"......"

At this moment, Su Yu looked up at the sky, a martial artist... ha!
