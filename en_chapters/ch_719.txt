Chapter 719: The Peculiar Human Emperor! (Please Subscribe)

"Human Emperor!"

At this moment, Su Yu had only one thought: Was the small stone seal left by the Human Emperor intentional or accidental? Did Xingyue bury this stone seal without any ulterior motive? Perhaps.

However, for Su Yu, the pressure from the Source of the Dao had suddenly lessened by thirty percent or more. The small stone must have the ability to suppress the power of laws here. Even if it couldn't suppress everything, reducing the power of laws by thirty percent would downgrade a Heavenly King-level expert to a second or even third-tier Daofuse.

"Incredible methods!" Su Yu marveled.

The Source of the Dao was a place where many Upper Realm experts gathered, yet it was the Human Emperor's domain. Did anyone know this? Were the powerful beings of the myriad races truly unafraid of the Human Emperor having a legacy? If he did, perhaps he could control the power of laws here and capture them all in one fell swoop!

As Su Yu pondered these thoughts, he quietly merged into the Source of the Dao. The light screen did not cause any ripples. The moment he entered, Su Yu sensed countless ownerless, attribute-less powers of laws.

"A treasure trove!" Su Yu exclaimed inwardly. This place was indeed a treasure trove. He had seen such attribute-less powers of laws before, usually as rewards for crossing realms in the Allheaven Battlefield. Here, it was as if he was being rewarded every day!

"The Upper Realm... No wonder so many people want to come here. No wonder so many Daofuse experts leave the Lower Realm. With a treasure trove like the Source of the Dao, I would want to come too!"

Back then, it was so difficult for Su Yu to obtain some power of laws as a reward. Yet here, there was an abundance of ownerless, attribute-less powers of laws. Despite many experts constantly absorbing them, the concentration remained high. What did this signify? It meant this power was continuously being generated.

"The water in the River of Time is the power of laws, but it's solidified and cannot be diverted... The power of laws here is so abundant. Could it be that the Human Emperor extracted it from the River of Time and purified it?"

Su Yu was filled with curiosity about the Source of the Dao. He wanted to see what the River of Time here was like. He wanted to see what kind of path the Human Emperor had opened.

As for killing... that wasn't urgent. Coming to the Upper Realm to kill wasn't Su Yu's main goal. Here, he aimed to broaden his horizons, strengthen himself, deepen his understanding of the Great Dao, and gather intelligence. Killing eight Daofuse experts was just a bonus.

Yes, just a bonus.

He wasn't sure if the Daofuse experts of the Dragon Race, after dying, could transform into undead. Most likely not, as there was no River of Time to guide them. If they could, they would probably die with regrets.

"If they die elsewhere, they probably can't be guided away. But if they die here, I think there's a chance they could be revived!"

Su Yu thought to himself as he looked up at the sky. Other places weren't covered by the River of Time, but this place was, thanks to the Human Emperor. It was possible for them to transform into undead here.

Su Yu glanced around. This was the periphery, and he saw no one. He didn't delve deeper into the Source of the Dao; he wanted to walk the River of Time.

With a tearing sound, the void was ripped apart. Here, he could tear open the river!

The faint sound of flowing water reached Su Yu's ears. Each person's section of the River of Time was different, and Su Yu was cautious. What if someone else was also in the River of Time? Would they encounter each other? So even when entering the River of Time, one had to be careful.

Su Yu stepped into the River of Time, and it instantly closed and disappeared.

...

Within the Source of the Dao, countless experts were present. At the moment Su Yu entered, a powerful figure on a high mountain looked up at the sky, a glint of gold in his eyes. Someone had entered the River of Time? He seemed to sense a faint ripple.

After sensing it for a while, this formidable presence ignored it. Here, people often entered the River of Time, though it was less frequent now. Entering the River of Time was usually for merging or opening a Dao. Normally, there was no need.

...

In a valley, another expert, merged with the earth, opened his eyes and looked skyward. Opening the River of Time would catch the attention of some experts. Although the possibility was low, caution was necessary because something existed within the River of Time.

...

At this moment, several experts sensed faint ripples. However, because the ripples were weak, they assumed the opener wasn't strong, and the River of Time soon stabilized, so they paid no further attention. Entering the River of Time was common. Generally, it didn't require attention unless it was an unparalleled expert.

...

Su Yu, of course, was unaware of all this. To him, opening the River of Time wasn't a big deal. Everyone here should be able to do it. Of course, how large it could be opened and how far one could travel was uncertain.

With the small stone in hand, suppressing everything, the power of the Human Emperor's river felt less than the real River of Time, so there was no pressure.

At this moment, the river was turbulent. It was similar to the real River of Time, yet different. Upon entering, Su Yu felt a slight sensation. Silently experiencing that feeling, he proceeded with caution and solemnity.

This was, in fact, the Human Emperor's path. He wanted to see what path the Human Emperor had cultivated and what principles he understood.

The path of the undead was dominated by death energy. What dominated this path?

Following the river downstream, Su Yu knew that downstream was the break, while upstream was the true connection to the River of Time. The river's source was in the River of Time.

Of course, he wasn't in a hurry. Understanding the Great Dao couldn't be rushed. First, he would go downstream and take a look.

As he walked along the river, the further he went, the more turbulent it became, impacting Su Yu. Yet with the small stone in hand, the suppression was more effective due to the same source of power, having little effect on Su Yu.

"The path of water?" "The path of fire?"

Su Yu silently pondered. He seemed to have experienced the power of the Human Emperor's Great Dao, but upon careful reflection, he frowned. No! These paths of gold, wood, water, and fire were mixed, not representing the main power of this Dao.

As he walked, the river widened! Su Yu's expression grew more serious. "Another confluence of myriad Daos!"

Indeed, in this world, true unparalleled experts, in the end, all walked the path of myriad Daos converging! He began to understand!

The river widening represented more and more different powers of the Great Dao merging into the river, broadening it. However, Su Yu still hadn't sensed the main power of the Human Emperor.

This was odd. Normally, the main power should be the most obvious. For instance, upon entering the path of the undead, one could immediately feel the power of death energy.

"Could it be balanced development, creating a second River of Time?"

Su Yu fell into contemplation. If so, the Human Emperor was imitating the River of Time, simply merging myriad Daos. This was also Su Yu's previous thought, but even Su Yu had focal points.

"Was the Human Emperor, a hero of his era, without even a trace of his unique Great Dao power?"

Su Yu couldn't understand and didn't dwell on it. He continued forward.

As he walked, Su Yu felt something unusual. There were no tributaries on either side, or rather, there were few... but they existed! Su Yu's eyes flickered. Normally invisible to others, he could see them.

"Even here, there are tributaries!"

Equivalent to the Ink Dao on the path of the undead, tributaries were opened on the tributaries. However, the Human Emperor's path had just been opened!

"Crazy!"

Su Yu inhaled sharply, quickly feeling astonished. "Does this mean someone has comprehended their own Dao on the Human Emperor's path and opened their own Dao? But the Human Emperor's path is only partially opened. Opening a tributary here is too risky!"

The Human Emperor's path wasn't a complete path, not even finished by the Human Emperor himself. Opening another Dao on his path... that path might not be strong. Even if it wasn't weak, Su Yu felt its stability was too poor, too prone to accidents. It was essentially a branch of the Human Emperor's path.

"If the Human Emperor wanted to create a second River of Time, he could indeed open a path."

"The master of the path of the undead didn't want to become a second River of Time, so he didn't allow others to open paths on his Dao. Instead, all Daos merged into the path of the undead, becoming one."

The master of the path of the undead was likely quite domineering. My path is here; you either become my servant or don't come. If you come, you can only cultivate my path!

Yet on the Human Emperor's incomplete path, someone had opened a Dao.

Su Yu found it incredibly strange. After a thorough investigation, he continued forward, thoughts swirling in his mind, vaguely forming ideas.

He continued downstream. He walked for a long time. Although from the outside, the River of Time seemed broken and not far, walking on the River of Time, Su Yu discovered the Human Emperor had actually opened a considerable distance.

After a while, the small stone in Su Yu's hand emitted a faint glow, almost merging with the Human Emperor's river, allowing Su Yu to maintain stability.

The river grew more turbulent!

Suddenly, ahead, like a great waterfall, Su Yu quickly halted. He saw the light ahead! The break!

The Human Emperor's path ended here. A large amount of river water flowed out, like a waterfall, crashing into the Source of the Dao. This was likely the reason for the dense power of laws in the Source of the Dao.

"If I fall from here, will I directly fall into the Source of the Dao, or be swept away, into an unknown future?"

At this moment, Su Yu seemed to stand at the peak of a waterfall, with a torrent of river water rushing towards him, flowing downward. This river water was all power of laws, sourced from the true River of Time.

Chapter 1: The Path of Responsibility

In the depths of the River of Time, a breach had formed, channeling through the Human Emperor's river. Here, the great path fractured, ceasing its expansion, and the cascading waters transformed into the power of laws.

"This is the origin of the unclaimed power of laws!" 

Su Yu observed intently, silently comprehending. He watched as a vast amount of the power of laws fell from the river, dispersing into strands before even reaching the ground. The force of the current grew stronger, seemingly intent on pulling Su Yu down with it.

A small stone glowed, stabilizing Su Yu's form. He continued to watch the waterfall, his gaze suddenly shifting as he sat cross-legged, continuing his observation.

Countless strands of the power of laws seemed to undergo purification here. Originally, they were a confluence of myriad paths, each with attributes like fire, earth, and water. Yet, what Su Yu sensed in the Source of the Dao was attribute-less.

Previously, Su Yu hadn't understood, but now he saw a net rising in the middle of the descending waterfall, acting like a filter, extracting and purifying the attributes from the power of laws.

"Those with attributes can't fall through..."

Su Yu's eyes flickered with curiosity. He suddenly felt an urge to descend and examine the center of the waterfall. What would be the consequences? Would he perish? Would he become lost in the River of Time?

He didn't know. Yet, Su Yu wanted to see for himself.

A newly opened path of creation, not yet perfected, held immense allure for Su Yu.

"What if I become lost? What if I'm trapped here for millions of years?"

Su Yu hesitated, torn between his desire to explore and the responsibilities he bore. If he were alone, he would have ventured down without hesitation.

"Responsibility..."

The word echoed in his mind. Responsibility! He bore many responsibilities. Su Yu had once said that being the Human Lord was a burden, a responsibility, not a privilege.

He found himself conflicted. He carried too many responsibilities. If it were a necessary risk, it would be justified. But to risk his life merely for observation, potentially losing his life or becoming lost, what would happen to those he brought to the Upper Realm?

"To hear the Dao in the morning, one can die content by evening."

Su Yu murmured, recalling Lantian's words. He longed to be as carefree and unrestrained as Lantian. As a cultivator, he too wished to hear the Dao and die content.

Cultivation was a pursuit of the unknown, a quest for the future. The great path was long, and one sought the unknown, seeking a future path.

Yet, at this moment, he hesitated.

"I... have shackled myself."

Su Yu murmured, realizing that he now sought stability, unlike the reckless days of his youth. Back then, he feared nothing. Back then, the barefooted feared not those with shoes. No burdens, no responsibilities.

"Responsibility!"

Su Yu pondered deeply. This responsibility, this shackle, was self-imposed. When the Great Zhou King and others elevated him to the position of Human Lord, he was ensnared. At that moment, he was three parts unwilling, three parts reluctant, three parts deliberate, and one part influenced by certain people and words.

With great power came great responsibility. Wan Tiansheng had once told him that when one achieved success, they should help the world. At that time, Su Yu controlled thirty-six cities and was considered successful. Returning to the Human Realm, he still carried a sense of responsibility.

The word "responsibility" flashed again in Su Yu's mind. Should he go down? Forget it! It was too dangerous. Moreover, the effort might not yield any reward. Last time, he took a risk for Lantian because there was hope for success, and if successful, the Human Race would gain a top-tier combatant. The facts proved that Su Yu had won last time!

This time, it was merely for observation.

"Forget it, there will be other opportunities."

Su Yu felt a tinge of regret. He wanted to see, but those he brought to the Upper Realm were waiting for him to lead them back to the Lower Realm. Unnecessary risks were not worth it, even if he might gain some insights.

Su Yu stood up, turned, and began to walk upstream. He needed to leave! If he stayed any longer, he feared he wouldn't be able to resist jumping down.

At this moment, the Human Emperor's path trembled slightly. Su Yu paused, looking towards the river. Suddenly, amidst the turbulent flow, a small, stable path emerged, gradually surfacing from the riverbed.

Su Yu was taken aback. The small path resembled the blood path Lantian had opened that day, now paving a way for Su Yu.

"Responsibility!"

Su Yu murmured. Human Emperor! Was this the core of the Human Emperor's path? So simple? No, perhaps the Human Emperor, this mighty ruler, his philosophy, his understanding, was responsibility!

"Does he believe that protecting the Human Race is his responsibility?"

Su Yu felt a complex mix of emotions. Becoming an emperor meant bearing responsibility? Even the ancient Human Emperor was no exception?

The power of the great path surged into Su Yu's body. He frowned, his acupoints trembling, and suddenly expelled the power. 

Su Yu sighed softly, "Are you seeking a responsible successor? I'm not... sorry!"

He shook his head, his eyes filled with a sense of helplessness. He had inadvertently triggered something! The path opened by the Human Emperor, incomplete, had responsibility as its core—responsibility to the Human Race, to the species.

This path's core sought to pass its power to Su Yu.

"You're too hasty, aren't you even going to test me?"

Su Yu chuckled bitterly. The Human Emperor had left something in this path, intending to pass this half-opened path to him easily!

This was the first time Su Yu encountered such a situation, where a momentary mindset could lead to inheriting a great path.

"If I truly wished to inherit, would it mean I could gradually control this path, becoming the master of the Source of the Dao, and continue along the Human Emperor's path?"

Su Yu thought the Human Emperor was foolish. Just like that? Aren't you going to assess me properly?

Alright, this path had many triggers. The Human Race, even the Human Lord, responsibility to the Human Race, pursuit of the Dao, understanding of the great path, protection of the species...

Of course, Su Yu was not inclined. Not because it came too easily, but because he didn't want to become the next Human Emperor. This path was not fully developed. If Su Yu truly inherited it, he might need a lot of time to master and develop it, becoming the next Human Emperor, with even the path opened for him!

"I have my own path."

Su Yu chuckled, "Besides, I just want to borrow power, not become the next you!"

"Your sense of responsibility... differs from mine!"

"You and I, after all, are not the same kind of person!"

"My responsibility, my tolerance, my kindness, are only for those who tolerate and treat me well. Your responsibility and mine are different!"

Su Yu spoke softly. Yet, the power of the great path continued to flow into him. Su Yu continued to resist! The power of the great path continued to flow in!

"Damn!"

Su Yu suddenly cursed, "I've never seen such a stubborn path. I've said I don't want it, and you're shackling me! Is this a trap?"

Su Yu suddenly felt trapped! What kind of power couldn't be driven away! I've said I don't want it, I have my own path, and yet you insist on flowing into me, what do you mean?

He quickly looked at the small stone, then at his Human Lord Seal. Sure enough! These two treasures suppressed the surrounding power of laws, but this path of responsibility's power couldn't be suppressed!

"A trap!"

Su Yu suddenly cursed, it was all a trap! Damn it! Did the Human Emperor foresee this day and set a trap for future generations?

The small stone and Human Lord Seal could suppress other powers of the great path, but not this power of responsibility, it was a trap!

"Damn!"

Su Yu cursed again, the Human Emperor, this old bastard, must have set some rules back then.

"I'm not doing it!"

Su Yu refused! Absolutely not! He became the Human Lord to fulfill a responsibility, but not to make responsibility a shackle, a duty, the core of his life.

Damn it! If this continues, whatever I do in the future, I'll always think my responsibility is to protect all beings, to protect the Human Race. Nonsense, that's not Su Yu's style.

If someone bullies me, if they're from the Human Race, maybe I'll think I need to tolerate them because I'm Human Race, and it's my responsibility to care for them!

"Old bastard, go to hell!"

Su Yu cursed furiously! He fell into the trap! No, I won't accept it. But tearing through the river and leaving, re-entering, might result in the same situation.

Damn it!

Suddenly, Su Yu turned and ran madly towards the end he had just reached, shouting, "Dream on, I won't inherit this thing, a half-opened path, trying to buy my future... do you think I'm stupid?"

With a loud crash, he jumped off the waterfall. It was just a momentary feeling! It's not like Su Yu truly wanted to take on the responsibility of protecting the Human Race, it's not like he wanted to protect everyone, like the Control King's lineage, they're also Human Race, should I protect them?

Like those idiots from Hundred Battle, should I take responsibility to protect them?

Bah! Let the Human Emperor do it himself, I won't.

As Su Yu jumped, the emerging path of responsibility seemed to hesitate, gradually dissipating, merging back into the Human Emperor's river.

...

At the same time, deep within the true River of Time, an extremely deep place.

A phantom appeared again, with a sense of sigh, a hint of strangeness, a touch of bewilderment.

"What is the current state of the Human Race?"

Recently, the River of Time had been in constant turmoil, and the Human Race might be undergoing changes, but that was expected. Another Human Emperor's path, or rather, the path of responsibility, was a path to the heavens. It seemed to have found a successor, someone capable of triggering this inheritance, someone who must be extraordinary, someone who fit the ideal successor in his mind.

But... what was going on?

The successor seemed to be resisting fiercely, and after the resistance, it was as if something was directly reversed, abruptly interrupting the process of succession.

Is my path not strong enough?

"As long as you inherit this path, and since there is no current ruler of the Myriad Realms, you can sweep across the heavens..."

"Inheriting this path offers hope to open another day, becoming the Lord of Heaven!"

"Inheriting this path allows one to become a true Human Emperor... Why resist?"

Doubts about life arose!

Has the world become so peculiar?

It was merely asking you to fulfill a responsibility, yet since you could touch this path, you should have the heart for it.

Why... refuse?

"There are oddities every year, but this year there are especially many."

A voice filled with indescribable helplessness and unspeakable vicissitudes.

Truly peculiar!

To trigger the succession of this path, many conditions must be met; it is not a simple matter.

Of course, Su Yu could trigger it because he truly met all the conditions.

For example, the Heaven Gate.

For example, recognition from two or more of the Four Extremes Human Kings, or being a descendant, or having the recognition of the Four Extremes Human King's legacy.

For example, an immensely rich human fortune.

For example, a strong sense of responsibility.

There are many other factors, tests set by the Human Emperor, which Su Yu barely felt, but they were all set invisibly, not something that could be achieved overnight, not something you could inherit just by passing a few checkpoints.

It was a slow accumulation, eventually leading to a qualitative change, allowing for a smooth succession.

Yet... it was refused!

At this moment, the shadow was somewhat frantic. Why?

The current human race seems to be in a lot of trouble.

Some years ago, it seems something happened that caused the human race to suffer heavy losses, with their fortune dissipating by ninety percent, facing the danger of extinction. Logically, isn't this the time to urgently strengthen oneself and save the human race?

Damn!

Why refuse?

I don't understand!

I really want to go back and see who this bastard is!

Truly peculiar!

...

"Truly peculiar!"

At this moment, Su Yu, who had jumped down, also cursed silently.

The Human Emperor is truly peculiar!

Such a power of the Great Dao, and it doesn't even require a test to inherit it. I just thought about it, and it wants me to inherit the Great Dao. Are you crazy?

"I even said the Human Emperor was a heroic lord, what a joke! Just because I thought about taking responsibility, you want me to take full responsibility?"

"What a joke!"

"Once the human race is stabilized, do I still have to take responsibility? Haven't I served as a servant for a few years already? You want me to do it for a lifetime?"

"Nonsense!"

Su Yu cursed under his breath!

Yet, in his heart, he had more thoughts. Don't say it, now that I still have a way out, I am not too willing to inherit.

But... what if one day there is no way out?

"Maybe, at that time, I can pick up the scraps!"

Su Yu had jumped down but was stopped by the net in the middle of the waterfall. Su Yu wasn't surprised, just thinking with some peculiarity.

The Human Emperor's path, even if incomplete, is truly powerful.

Su Yu felt that if it were fully developed, it might not be inferior to the Death Path, perhaps even stronger.

"If the Human Emperor could successfully develop it, he would be the second person in the heavens!"

The first person, Su Yu temporarily gave to the master of the River of Time.

Of course, now that the development has failed, is he the third person in the heavens?

The second person is definitely the master of the Death Path!

"Stronger than the human race's physical path, even if only a little bit is developed, if I were to integrate from the start, maybe... I could also compare to the ruler of laws?"

"This path is so easy to inherit, yet no human has inherited it before?"

Su Yu found it very strange. Why?

Is there any difficulty?

No difficulty at all!

I, on my first day here, don't even want it, yet this path is desperately forcing me to take it, so why hasn't anyone inherited it all these years?

"Geniuses... are too lonely!"

Su Yu sighed, geniuses are truly too lonely.

The Great Dao is fighting to be inherited by me.

What Culture King path, Human Emperor path, Time path, all these powerful paths are fighting to be inherited by me, it's too hard, I don't even want them.

Of course, deep down, Su Yu knew it wasn't that simple.

However, it didn't stop Su Yu from being a little narcissistic.

Indeed, too much of a genius!

Nothing can be done about it!

"Not inheriting your path is just holding onto a sliver of hope... truly inheriting your path means my path ends here."

Su Yu sighed in his heart, unless there is no other way, unless absolutely necessary, I don't want to give up my own Great Dao.

Cultivating, comprehending the Dao, ultimately walking the path arranged by predecessors, exactly the same, replicating another Human Emperor, what's the point?

The Human Emperor failed, can replicating one succeed?

With a light laugh, Su Yu discarded all the thoughts he had just had. The path of responsibility is the Human Emperor's, not mine.

"Peculiar Human Emperor, no wonder you have no successor!"

Su Yu grumbled, so many people you didn't choose, you chose me, don't you know I, Su Yu, hate being shackled?

"It can be a backup!"

At this moment, Su Yu arranged this path as his backup, with no other path to walk, no other choice, he could think of a way to try again.

He didn't think about it anymore, nor did he dwell on the fact that he had just given up a chance to become the ruler of laws.

For someone else, it might be a regret.

But for Su Yu, there wasn't much regret, what of the ruler of laws?

Just an incomplete Great Dao!

Actually, he still didn't think much of it, if the complete Death Path and Time Path were given to me... ahem, I might consider it.

Yes, that's right, I didn't think much of the Human Emperor's path.

Mainly because you only opened a little bit, if you opened it stronger, I might take it more seriously.

Su Yu smiled, no longer caring about it, carefully observing the grid he was on. Above, a large amount of river water continued to rush down, and this layer of filter seemed to filter out all the attribute rules.

Su Yu sat cross-legged on the net, silently observing, sensing, and feeling.

Letting the river water impact him, the Little Stone and Human Lord Seal were both resisting these forces.

Gradually, Su Yu saw something.

He saw a large number of fire attribute rules gathering together, soon, these attribute rules were gathered, and before long, these fire attribute rules turned into a small waterfall stream.

Like a small dragon, struggling and wandering on the grid.

This little dragon seemed to want to drill out, to drill below the grid, but the power was obviously not enough, and there were many such little dragons, all wanting to drill out!

They attacked each other, collided with each other, the pure power of rules filtered out spilled down from the grid, but these with attributes did not, always colliding with each other, impacting.

Gradually, Su Yu's eyes became peculiar.

He saw a relatively large golden little dragon appearing in the distance, carrying a sharp aura, seemingly cutting the grid, but was locked by the grid, locking this golden dragon.

Boom!

A loud noise came, and the golden little dragon suddenly exploded.

A small crack appeared on the grid.

The exploded golden little dragon had a little bit left, quickly drilling out of the crack, and at this moment, Su Yu vaguely heard someone roaring: "Path of rules, path of weapons, incomplete!"

In an instant, it seemed like many people were shouting, roaring!

Soon, the broken grid was rapidly recovering.

And on the grid, there was no longer such a powerful rule force gathering like that golden little dragon.

Su Yu's eyes were extremely peculiar!

"This... is the source of those ownerless rules and Great Dao in the Land of Dao Source!"

"This path is incomplete!"

Why incomplete?

Because just now, to rush down, the grid was broken, so this time what fell was an incomplete Great Dao, if it could be smuggled down completely, it would be a complete power of the Great Dao!

"So that's how it is..."

Su Yu murmured, with some shock.

Soon, his eyes changed, damn!

So, these little dragons around him are actually some embryonic Great Daos.

Su Yu frowned: "Embryonic Great Dao, rules manifested... this grid filters these attribute forces, gathering into a Dao? What is this grid?"

"Then these embryonic Great Daos, I can actually take them away, give them to others, equivalent to inheriting the rules of the Great Dao?"

"No... it's not that simple, these rules of the Great Dao... are not perfect!"

Su Yu suddenly shook his head, his eyes flashing crazily, these Great Daos are not perfect!

Nonsense, the Human Emperor's Great Dao is not perfect, let alone some attribute forces filtered out from the Human Emperor's Great Dao, they are even less perfect!

"Compared to the Daos of the Myriad Realms, they are much inferior, but easier to grasp, easier to integrate..."

Su Yu thought, his eyes flashing, murmuring: "The guys from the Upper Realm, if they take this as nourishment for their own Great Dao, it's a good thing, but if they really abandon their own Great Dao, the Daos of the Myriad Realms, and switch to these seemingly complete Great Daos... they will die very miserably!"

Are there such people?

Maybe there are!

After all, given a complete Great Dao, one that no one has cultivated, can you not be tempted?

"So, these tributaries on the Human Emperor's Great Dao might be those who took away the Great Dao, then cultivated, then grafted onto the Human Emperor's Great Dao?"

The Human Emperor's Great Dao also has tributaries.

Su Yu was curious before, puzzled, just the Human Emperor developed this little bit of the Great Dao, and there are people who can open a Dao on it?

There isn't that much power to open a Dao for you!

Now I understand!

It's gathered, countless attribute power rules, gathered into a pseudo-Dao, and this pseudo-Dao was cultivated by people, because the source is the Human Emperor's Great Dao, so it automatically connected to the Human Emperor's Great Dao!

"So... all are pseudo-Dao experts?"

Su Yu laughed, "This... this... oh my!"

Suddenly his face turned serious!

The Human Emperor... the Human Emperor's path, how is it somewhat similar to my idea, borrowing a chicken to lay eggs!

It's just that Su Yu uses the compendium to let people cultivate his fake Dao.

The Human Emperor... wouldn't he also have this idea?

In this place, they use fake paths to deceive people, and then these Great Daos are taken away, cultivated, and connected to the Human Emperor's Great Dao, providing a stable source for it.

"Phew!"

Su Yu exhaled deeply, his eyes flickering with thought. Is this what the Human Emperor intended? Or was it an unintended consequence? If so, the Human Emperor... isn't exactly a good person. Just like me, he's also using others to achieve his goals. Will the powerhouses of the Myriad Realms end up being toyed with by us?
