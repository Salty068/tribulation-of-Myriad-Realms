Chapter 683: Life Realm

Despite his disdain, Wan Tiansheng still displayed the demeanor of a Grandmaster.

Literary Talent!

Countless miniature Wan Tianshengs were reading, and in just a hundred years, he felt he possessed more gravitas and experience than those old ghosts who had lived for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.

*Belly full of poems, spirit naturally refined.*

Perhaps, this was the true portrayal of Wan Tiansheng.

When Su Yu read, his scholarly aura was mostly a disguise. Su Yu had read for over a decade and learned much from books, but he lacked this kind of composure.

Wan Tiansheng's Dao Opening also gave Su Yu an epiphany.

It turned out that Dao Opening was not what he had imagined—a forceful pioneering forward. No, it was about using one's insights to expand one's Dao. Brute force alone could not widen a tributary.

That Human Dao rapidly expanded before Su Yu's eyes.

Of course, it was far less powerful than the Grand Daos Su Yu had seen, not as vast. However, every part of this Dao was pioneered by Wan Tiansheng himself, little by little. The river water flowing into the tributary was the power of laws.

These powers of laws could not be utilized in the River of Time.

But once they flowed into a tributary, they transformed into the attributes one needed, coming under one's control.

Wan Tiansheng's aura also grew stronger and stronger!

His true body wore a look of gratification. He turned to Su Yu, who was on the main Dao, and smiled. Culture King's seal was also a good thing! In these ten years, I've gained many new insights. I've killed Eternals, seen Daofuse experts, observed myriad Daos, and traveled through the Myriad Realms…

He chuckled. If I had attempted Dao Opening ten years ago, I would have been unable to continue long ago! Even if I had opened a Dao, I might not have had these experiences and tempering I have today.

Su Yu smiled. Principal, you've accumulated so much; you're bound to succeed eventually.

Wan Tiansheng smiled and said no more.

The miniature Wan Tianshengs gradually diminished, signifying that Wan Tiansheng's accumulated foundation had fully integrated into the Human Dao.

The tributary rumbled, continuously expanding.

When it had expanded to a certain extent, Wan Tiansheng's aura became incredibly powerful, vaguely feeling as if he had reached the Daofuse stage.

Dao Opening, in fact, had no concept of Daofuse.

It was even simply called Eternal!

The White Dog had said that when opening a Dao, one didn't know how long it would be, so how could one divide it into stages?

How could one know if they had reached the Daofuse stage?

In truth, one knew nothing. It was only by comparing oneself to others that one could roughly determine a rank. A Dao Opener was an Eternal.

But in Su Yu's perception, Wan Tiansheng might now possess Daofuse battle prowess.

What his actual situation was, Su Yu didn't know.

A moment later, all the miniature Wan Tianshengs vanished.

Wan Tiansheng's Dao Opening didn't rely on any weapons; he directly traversed and opened the Dao with his physical body.

At this moment, he instantly appeared before Su Yu.

He flew out from the tributary!

Wan Tiansheng glanced at the Dao he had opened and sighed. Not enough foundation! Not enough life experience! Still too little experience, too few insights; I can no longer continue pioneering!

He continued, smiling. There used to be a saying that the character Dao could advance a thousand *li* in a day, 'a commoner in the morning, a high official by evening.' Now, I deeply understand it. You could be considered an Emperor; have I entered your sight?

Su Yu chuckled. Of course, but… competing with Lan Tian is quite stressful.

The previously extraordinary Wan Tiansheng instantly fell silent.

He just stared at Su Yu.

*Do you know that you've interrupted all my thoughts, making me instantly plummet from the peak to the valley?*

Su Yu grinned, looking at the tributary. Principal, are you not continuing your Dao Opening?

I've reached my limit!

Wan Tiansheng recovered from his speechlessness and explained. My limit is here; I'll accumulate more later! Every battle, every book I read, every person I observe, every deed I accomplish, all contribute to my accumulation! My previous accumulation has been completely exhausted.

Then, Principal, do you think you can contend with a Daofuse expert now?

Daofuse?

Wan Tiansheng chuckled. How can I know if I don't fight?

Su Yu nodded. Then, that's all for today?

He added. Principal, if you open a Dao yourself, the laws might not permit it. There might be a punishment from the laws later.

Wan Tiansheng nodded, but soon smiled. Not necessarily. The laws only cover the areas where their Grand Daos exist. There are still Grand Daos here, but further ahead, there might be no Grand Daos, and thus no punishment from the laws…

Despite saying that, Wan Tiansheng looked upstream and still shook his head. Forget it, I can't go any further! Going against the current implies breaking through the past! Time is constantly flowing; breaking the flow of time is almost impossible!

After speaking, he glanced forward again. I vaguely feel that something might be waiting for us ahead!

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then chuckled after a long pause. Perhaps! Perhaps it's a disaster, an earth-shattering battle! In the past, Human Emperor and the others, were they beyond the endless void, or within this strange long river? Who can know?

Perhaps, those people have always existed in their own past.

The flow of time for both sides is different; the other side exists in another dimension.

When the past and present synchronize, perhaps they will meet.

Wan Tiansheng nodded. In fact, he also vaguely felt it. At this moment, he chuckled. If we were to find someone to fight here for three to five years, perhaps outside, three to five decades, or even three to five centuries, would have passed! When they can't find us and think we're dead, and we finish our battle and flow downstream, returning to where we entered, perhaps… a thousand years would have passed in the world!

Wan Tiansheng was deeply insightful and sighed. Perhaps that's how it is, but there's still one thing I haven't figured out: why don't they flow downstream, but instead stay in place or fight upstream?

Flowing downstream, logically, they should quickly converge with the present, fighting from the past to the present.

So why not do that?

Su Yu chuckled. Principal, isn't that simple? Someone won't let them! If there's someone, or a blockade like Culture King's just now, blocking our retreat, wouldn't we also have to rely on time to wear them down? Either kill the opponent, break the seal, or keep fighting downstream…

Wan Tiansheng pondered. That's true, you see things clearly.

Su Yu smiled. It's human nature. If some things I know are true, it means that Human Emperor and his group might be preventing those people from returning! And they have a convergence point with us, or rather, in this era, if they want to return… I know where.

Wan Tiansheng glanced at him, then said gravely after a moment. The ninth layer!

Su Yu nodded. Right, that's also their entry point! They must have entered from there, and to come out, to converge with the present, they might have to exit through there!

Su Yu chuckled. What do you think, Principal?

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment, then nodded. That place might indeed have an entrance. If we want to find them, perhaps we can enter from there, or keep going upstream to find them in the past!

Forget it!

Su Yu laughed. A group of Lords of Laws, incredibly powerful! Even if they've fought for countless years, they're not someone we can contend with! I'd rather they all not return!

Wan Tiansheng also smiled, saying no more. He stepped forward. Let's go, time to return! This Dao can only be opened this far for now!

With that, he retrieved a character that had integrated into Su Yu's Heaven Gate.

He no longer looked at the tributary, nor at other Grand Daos, but silently savored the different sensations. After a long while, he spoke. Heaven Gate is a good thing, but it also has drawbacks!

Su Yu frowned.

Wan Tiansheng explained. It lacks a bit of the desire for exploration! If I give you the answer directly when you're solving a problem, your solution will definitely be correct, but in the process, you'll miss much of the joy of solving it, the pleasure of self-exploration! There's no sudden enlightenment! Next time, if I give you the answer, you'll solve it, but if I don't, you might not be able to, because you lack that desire for exploration, that thirst for knowledge!

This might not necessarily be a good thing!

He explained. The River of Time is mysterious. Yet now, you lack a sense of awe and a desire to explore this mystery, because in your eyes, a Grand Dao is just a river, just some tributaries! In this way, everything you see will be very uninteresting!

Uninteresting!

Su Yu pondered.

Wan Tiansheng added. Dao Opening is a kind of interest, a realization from one's true heart. It's about what I feel I need, what I am capable of, what I can do… rather than, 'I see this Dao is very powerful, so I'll open this Dao!'

The essence of the Grand Dao that Su Yu saw was indeed clearer than Wan Tiansheng's, but Wan Tiansheng was now saying that seeing more wasn't necessarily a good thing!

He continued. When you face an enemy, I suggest you open your Heaven Gate to confront them! However, when you comprehend the Grand Dao, you should close your Heaven Gate! If you see the essence, you overlook the process. What if you see the end of the pen dao? You'll think it's nothing special, that you can reach the end. So, you focus on reaching the end, but in the process, have you truly comprehended anything? Can you truly reach the end?

I give you an answer, and you only stare at the answer, calculating it. Perhaps you can try it out or guess it correctly repeatedly, but does this mean you've truly mastered this problem?

Do you know the calculation process?

Do you know why it needs to be calculated this way?

Yes, you gave me the correct answer, but so what?

Wan Tiansheng said earnestly. If you close your Heaven Gate now and look at the River of Time again, you might have a different understanding.

Su Yu thought for a moment and closed his Heaven Gate.

In an instant, the great river surged, the tributaries on both banks became invisible, and the entire River of Time suddenly became much murkier.

For a moment, Su Yu suddenly felt blind.

Not blind, but like a nearsighted person who had lost their glasses, seeing everything as a blur. This was the normal person's perspective.

Where is the pen dao?

Su Yu silently sensed it. He and Wan Tiansheng were walking back, so the pen dao should be along the way.

Soon, he trembled slightly.

He looked to one side; that should be where the pen dao was.

At this moment, Su Yu saw something. He saw faint fluctuations of a tributary. The character seemed to be leaping, telling him to enter the pen dao and continue forward.

But Su Yu shook his head. Before this, he could see the front of the tributary, but now, he saw nothing.

He could only roughly see the 30% or so of the territory he controlled, and even this 30% wasn't very clear.

Su Yu pondered, then looked at Wan Tiansheng. Principal, you should be able to see the Dao you pioneered completely clearly, right?

Wan Tiansheng nodded.

Su Yu understood and sighed. I see. And for the pen dao I've fused with, I know how much I've fused, but in reality, even this small section has many corners I haven't looked at or thought about. I haven't thoroughly comprehended this small section of the pen dao!

Su Yu chuckled. I only focused on looking ahead, but I overlooked some details. Heaven Gate has brought me immense help, but it has also created some drawbacks, a bit like pulling up seedlings to help them grow!

Wan Tiansheng nodded again. In fact, Heaven Gate is a very powerful thing, seeing through the essence of the Grand Dao! This thing, in any era, is a symbol of invincibility! However, those who open Heaven Gate will definitely have different strengths! Some people might be like you, seeing through the essence but overlooking many things, ultimately becoming arrogant and impractical, unable to go far!

Su Yu thought for a moment, then nodded. Yes, I understand! Martial Emperor! Martial Emperor was practically useless. He opened Heaven Gate, probably even earlier than Culture King and the others. Yet, among Culture King and the others, Martial King could easily suppress him! If I'm not mistaken, Human Emperor, and the Four Kings—Culture, Martial, Control, and Radiant—all opened Heaven Gate! Martial Emperor should be weaker than the Four Kings, even though Martial Emperor is an elder. Yet he's so weak… he probably didn't seek a thorough understanding during his Dao Opening… a brute is a brute!

Su Yu was deeply moved!

Some previous thoughts instantly became clear.

I wondered why Martial Emperor was so miserable, suppressed, unable to defeat Martial King, despite having opened Heaven Gate. Su Yu thought that those who opened Heaven Gate should be peerlessly exceptional.

Now he understood. Martial Emperor probably also didn't seek a thorough understanding. It's hard to say if he even opened his own Dao; perhaps he saw a powerful Dao and just fused with it!

Just like Su Yu fusing with the pen dao now!

Once Su Yu controls the pen dao, he might not be able to strengthen it, or even open his own Dao, because his energy would be focused on Dao Fusion, and he might not have time for Dao Opening!

Even if he opened a Dao, he might disdain it for being too small, too weak, because having seen towering mountains, how could he look upon a small mound?

Seeing his realization, Wan Tiansheng chuckled. You are a smart person, not like Martial Emperor, who sounds like a reckless brute! There should be more than just these few who opened Heaven Gate, but there are strong and weak ones, meaning everyone's insights are still different!

Su Yu nodded, then asked curiously. Principal, you didn't open Heaven Gate, and your aperture and Yuan Aperture aren't fully opened, so why are you so strong?

No, it's not that we are strong; it's that you are currently weak.

Wan Tiansheng shook his head. Your potential will definitely surpass mine! There's no doubt about that! At the same level, I shouldn't be your match, but you also said 'at the same level.' If you're fusing with a Dao now, you haven't reached that stage yet.

Oh!

Su Yu chuckled. Principal is still more learned! I also wondered why there are so many old antiques among the myriad races, yet none of them seem as learned as Principal? Principal has only lived for a hundred years.

Wan Tiansheng smiled. You're only 21 years old; how do you think your knowledge compares?

Not bad!

Compared to your peers?

Then of course my knowledge is greater. I've read myriad race cultivation techniques, seen powerful experts from the Myriad Realms, explored ancient times, traveled through the realms of life and death, and explored the essence of the Grand Dao… At the same age of 21, others are still striving for Skysoar Realm, while I've already seen through the essence of the Grand Dao…

Isn't that it?

Wan Tiansheng chuckled. Most of the Myriad Realms today are mediocre! Some old antiques either slumber or spend all day thinking about slaughter and becoming stronger, just thinking about becoming stronger, burying themselves in bitter cultivation, without thinking about *why* they can become stronger? Without thinking about *what* they will do after becoming stronger? They just simply want to become stronger! Such thoughts are merely wishful thinking!

To give a simple example, when they fuse with a Dao, what do you think their first thought is about how to make themselves stronger?

Su Yu thought for a moment. Kill other Dao Fusers!

Exactly!

Wan Tiansheng chuckled. That's the thought of a mediocre person!

Su Yu felt awkward. I thought that too.

You're scolding me!

What does Principal think?

Me?

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment. Plunder insights!

Su Yu frowned. Wan Tiansheng explained. If a Dao is divided among ten people, and you occupy one-tenth, it doesn't mean others stole your share. It means that the insights of the other nine people are different from yours! This Dao represents ten kinds of insights, and you've only comprehended one of them. At this moment, you should comprehend what others have comprehended, what you haven't comprehended! When your comprehension becomes stronger than theirs, you can instantly plunder everything from them! You can squeeze them out, and your authority to control the power of laws will be stronger than theirs!

Su Yu understood. This is the power of a Lord of Laws, because they comprehend more. If you try to seize the power of laws from them, it's like an egg hitting a rock; they'll easily push you out!

Right!

Wan Tiansheng added. Take the pen dao, for example. If you control the pen dao, and you think you're a Lord of Laws, and no one can take your pen dao, but Culture King's comprehension might be deeper than yours! He doesn't need to control the pen dao, but he can instantly seize the pen dao, plundering your control over its insights… At that time, you'll be a lamb to the slaughter!

Su Yu nodded again. That makes sense. So, Principal means for me to find an opportunity to take down Culture King? To sow discord between me and Culture King?

…

Wan Tiansheng chuckled. How could that be!

Is Principal still holding a grudge?

Impossible!

Su Yu smiled. Definitely! Otherwise, why bring up Culture King out of nowhere?

Just a reminder!

Su Yu chuckled, but still accepted the advice. Principal is right, I will think about it carefully! I don't want to end up like Martial Emperor, who had flowers growing on his backside. He had exceptional talent and opened Heaven Gate, yet he met a tragic end!

Indeed, Martial Emperor is a bit useless.

Wan Tiansheng nodded.

Two juniors, only possessing Daofuse battle prowess, were evaluating a Lord of Laws, and a rather formidable one at that.

Being defeated by Martial King didn't mean Martial Emperor couldn't defeat other Lords of Laws. After all, he was someone who had opened Heaven Gate.

But in Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng's eyes, precisely because he had opened Heaven Gate, he shouldn't have been so weak as to be defeated by a junior.

…

A moment later.

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng tore through space and exited the River of Time.

At the same time, golden clouds and dark clouds appeared simultaneously between heaven and earth.

Wan Tiansheng looked at Su Yu. Should we avoid it?

Su Yu thought for a moment, then shook his head. Calamity is also a kind of insight. Principal, don't worry, one punishment isn't enough to consume much.

Wan Tiansheng chuckled. Then I'll also experience the situation of rewards and punishments coexisting!

The next moment, he stepped into the void.

Golden clouds and blood clouds flew towards him simultaneously. Wan Tiansheng suppressed the blood clouds with his left hand and absorbed the golden clouds with his right, silently comprehending. His left hand, however, transformed into a colossal palm reaching the sky, rumbling as it suppressed the blood clouds!

The punishment of laws, punishing him as a Dao Opener.

The key was that such punishment was aimed at Sunmoon Realm Dao Openers.

The main body of the punishment was for those from Sunmoon Realm to Eternal, at most having the destructive power of an Eternal of four or five stages. Of course, Wan Tiansheng was too strong; at this moment, the power of this punishment might be at the six or seven stage level.

However, for Wan Tiansheng, it was too weak!

He comprehended the golden clouds for a bit, then chuckled, saying something light and casual, and with a single palm, shattered the sky full of blood clouds.

They completely dissipated!

Below, the soldiers watched, dumbfounded.

The Eternal realm experts, however, looked very solemn.

These blood clouds were not weak.

Quite powerful!

Yet, Wan Tiansheng easily shattered the blood clouds. What was his current strength?

Great Zhou King also frowned, looking at Wan Tiansheng, vaguely feeling as if he had met a formidable opponent.

Wan Tiansheng had become Eternal!

A true Eternal!

He seemed to be opening a Dao, not fusing with one. Such an existence had no concept of Daofuse; he was simply an Eternal expert.

A moment later, Wan Tiansheng descended.

Standing beside Su Yu, he looked at Great Zhou King and smiled, his smile gentle. Greetings, Great Zhou King. I was in a hurry just now and forgot to pay my respects. Please forgive my rudeness, junior!

You're too kind!

Great Zhou King nodded slightly. Wan Tiansheng chuckled. It's only right! Senior has protected the human race for many years. Now, Emperor Yu has established the Cleansing Department and entrusted me with a heavy responsibility. I still have many matters to consult with Senior, including capturing Upper Realm rebels. Great Zhou King is familiar with the Upper Realm people, so I hope Great Zhou King will provide much assistance, allowing me to quickly investigate and expose the Upper Realm rebels!

Great Zhou King smiled. I will. I will tell you everything I know.

Wan Tiansheng nodded again. Then I trouble Senior. If Emperor Yu unifies the Myriad Realms again, Great Zhou King's arduous efforts will be highly meritorious, and a biography should be written and transformed into a law, so that future generations will remember it for tens of thousands of years! To leave behind a pure reputation for all generations of the human race, so they know of Great Zhou King's achievements.

Great Zhou King's mouth twitched. You flatter me. I am just an ordinary member
