Chapter 683: The Realm of Fate

Despite his disdain, Old Wan still exuded the demeanor of a master at this moment.

Talent!

Countless Wan Tianshengs were reading, and in just a hundred years, he seemed to possess more poise and experience than those ancient ghosts who had lived for tens of thousands of years.

A belly full of poetry and books naturally exudes elegance.

Perhaps this was the true portrayal of Wan Tiansheng.

Su Yu read books, and his scholarly demeanor was more of a disguise. Although he had learned much from books over the years, he lacked this kind of composure.

Wan Tiansheng's path-opening gave Su Yu an epiphany.

It turned out that opening a path wasn't about forcibly carving forward. Instead, it was about using one's insights to expand one's path. It wasn't something that brute force could achieve.

The "Human" path rapidly expanded right before Su Yu's eyes.

Of course, it wasn't as powerful or vast as the great paths Su Yu had seen, but all of these paths were carved out by Wan Tiansheng himself. The water flowing into these tributaries was the power of laws.

These powers of laws couldn't be utilized in the River of Time.

But once they flowed into the tributaries, they transformed into the attributes you needed, for you to control.

Wan Tiansheng's aura grew increasingly stronger!

His true self, with a face full of satisfaction, turned to look at Su Yu on the main path and smiled, "The Culture King's seal is also a good thing! Over the past ten years, I've gained many new insights, killed Eternals, seen Daofuse, witnessed myriad paths, and traversed myriad realms..."

He chuckled lightly, "If I had tried to open a path ten years ago, I might not have been able to continue! Even if I had opened a path, I might not have had these experiences and tempering."

Su Yu smiled, "Principal, with your accumulated strength, you'll succeed sooner or later."

Wan Tiansheng smiled and said no more.

The small Wan Tianshengs gradually disappeared, indicating that Wan Tiansheng's foundation had fully integrated into the human path.

The tributary rumbled, continuously expanding.

When it reached a certain point, Wan Tiansheng's aura became incredibly powerful, vaguely feeling like it had reached the level of Daofuse.

Opening a path didn't actually have a concept of Daofuse.

It was even just called Eternal!

White Dog had mentioned that when opening a path, you didn't know how long you needed to open it, or how to segment it.

How could you know if you had reached the level of Daofuse?

In reality, you knew nothing, only roughly positioning yourself through comparison with others. A path opener was simply Eternal.

But in Su Yu's perception, Wan Tiansheng might have Daofuse combat power at this moment.

In reality, Su Yu wasn't sure of his exact situation.

Moments later, all the small Wan Tianshengs disappeared.

Wan Tiansheng opened his path without relying on any weapons, essentially traversing the path with his physical body.

At this moment, he suddenly appeared in front of Su Yu.

He flew out from the tributary!

Wan Tiansheng glanced at the path he had opened and sighed, "Not enough foundation! Not enough life experience! I've experienced too little, comprehended too little, and can no longer continue to open it!"

He said this and smiled, "In the past, there was a saying that the path of divine texts advances by leaps and bounds, from a humble farmer to the emperor's hall in a day. Now, I truly understand it. You could be considered the emperor; have I caught your eye?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course, but... competing with Blue Sky is quite pressuring."

The previously extraordinary Wan Tiansheng instantly fell silent.

He just quietly looked at Su Yu.

Do you know that you interrupted all my thoughts, causing me to fall from the peak to the valley in an instant?

Su Yu grinned, looking at the tributary, "Principal, are you not continuing to open the path?"

"I've reached my limit!"

Wan Tiansheng broke free from his earlier silence and explained, "This is my limit. I'll accumulate more later! Every battle, every book I read, every person I see, every task I do, all contribute to my accumulation! My previous accumulation has been completely exhausted."

"Do you think you can match Daofuse now, Principal?"

"Daofuse?"

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "How could I know without a fight?"

Su Yu nodded, "So, is that all for today?"

He continued, "Principal, opening your own path might not be allowed by the rules, and there might be a punishment from the rules later."

Wan Tiansheng nodded, but quickly smiled, "Not necessarily. The rules only cover the areas where their great paths exist. This place still has great paths, but further ahead, there might be no great paths, no punishment from the rules..."

Saying this, Wan Tiansheng looked upstream but shook his head, "Forget it, I can't go further! Going against the current implies breaking through time! Time is flowing, and breaking through the flow of time is almost impossible!"

After speaking, he glanced forward, "I vaguely feel that something might be waiting for us ahead!"

Su Yu was silent for a while, then smiled, "Perhaps! Maybe it's a disaster, a world-shaking battle! Back then, where exactly were the Human Emperor and the others? Outside the endless void, or within this strange river? Who can say?"

Perhaps those people always existed in their past.

The flow of time might be different for both sides, with the other side in another dimension.

When the past and present times synchronize, perhaps they will meet.

Wan Tiansheng nodded. In fact, he vaguely felt it too. At this moment, he smiled, "If we find someone to fight here, and the battle lasts three to five years, maybe fifty or even five hundred years will have passed outside! When they can't find us and think we're dead, and we finish our battle and go downstream, returning to where we came in, perhaps... a thousand years will have passed in the world!"

Wan Tiansheng was deeply moved and sighed, "Maybe that's how it is, but there's one thing I still don't understand. Why don't they go downstream, but instead stay in place or fight upstream?"

Going downstream, theoretically, should quickly synchronize with the present, from fighting in the past to the present.

So why not do that?

Su Yu laughed, "Principal, isn't it simple? Someone won't allow it! If there's someone, or like the Culture King's seal just now, blocking our retreat, wouldn't we have to rely on time to wear them down? Either kill the opponent, break the seal, or keep fighting downstream..."

Wan Tiansheng pondered, "True, you see it clearly."

Su Yu chuckled, "It's human nature. If what I know is true, it means the Human Emperor and his group might be preventing those people from returning! And they have a convergence point with us, or rather, this era. If they want to return... I know where it is."

Wan Tiansheng looked at him for a long time, then said in a deep voice, "The Ninth Floor!"

Su Yu nodded, "Yes, that's also their entry point! They must have entered from there. To come out and synchronize with the present, they might have to come out from there!"

Su Yu smiled, "What do you think, Principal?"

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment, then nodded, "That place might really have an entrance. If we want to find them, we might enter from there, or keep going upstream to find them in the past!"

"Forget it!"

Su Yu laughed, "A group of masters of rules, incredibly powerful, even if they've fought for countless years, they're not something we can match! I'd rather they don't come back!"

Wan Tiansheng also laughed, said no more, and stepped forward, "Let's go back! This path can only be opened to this point for now!"

With that, he took back a character that had merged into Su Yu's Heaven Gate.

He no longer looked at the tributary or other great paths, just silently experiencing different feelings. After a long time, he said, "The Heaven Gate is a good thing, but it also has its drawbacks!"

Su Yu frowned.

Wan Tiansheng explained, "It lacks a bit of the desire to explore! When you solve a problem, I give you the answer directly. You solve it correctly, but in the process, you miss out on a lot of fun, lacking the joy of self-exploration! There's no sudden enlightenment! Next time, when you solve a problem, if I give you the answer, you'll solve it. But if I don't, you might not be able to, because you lack the desire to explore, the thirst for knowledge!"

"This might not be a good thing!"

He explained, "The River of Time is mysterious, but now, you lack a bit of awe and desire to explore this mystery, because in your eyes, the great paths are just a river, just some tributaries! As a result, everything you see becomes very dull!"

Dull!

Su Yu pondered.

Wan Tiansheng continued, "Opening a path is an interest, a realization of one's true self. I feel what I need, what I know, what I can do... not just seeing a powerful path and deciding to open it!"

The essence of the great paths Su Yu saw was indeed clearer than Wan Tiansheng's, but Wan Tiansheng was saying that seeing more wasn't necessarily a good thing!

He continued, "When you face an enemy, I suggest you open the Heaven Gate to fight! But when you comprehend the great paths, close the Heaven Gate! You see the essence, but you overlook the process. You see the end of the pen dao, so what? You think it's nothing special, you can reach the end, so you focus on reaching the end. But in the process, did you really comprehend anything? Can you really reach the end?"

"I give you an answer, you only focus on the answer, calculating, maybe you can try and guess it out, but does that mean you truly mastered this problem?"

"Do you understand the calculation process?"

"Do you know why it needs to be calculated this way?"

"Yes, you gave me the correct answer, so what?"

Wan Tiansheng earnestly said, "Now, close the Heaven Gate and look at this River of Time again. Maybe you'll have different insights."

Su Yu thought for a moment and closed the Heaven Gate.

In an instant, the river roared, and the tributaries on both banks disappeared. The entire River of Time suddenly became much murkier.

For a moment, Su Yu suddenly felt blind.

Not blind, but like a nearsighted person losing their glasses, everything became blurry. This was the perspective of a normal person.

"Where is the pen dao?"

Su Yu quietly pondered as he and Wan Tiansheng made their way back. The pen dao should be along this path. Soon, he felt a slight tremor. Glancing to the side, he sensed the presence of the pen dao. At this moment, Su Yu noticed some fluctuations in the tributary, and his divine characters seemed to be leaping with excitement, urging him to enter the pen dao and continue forward.

However, Su Yu shook his head. Previously, he could see the path ahead, but now, he could see nothing. He could only vaguely perceive about 30% of the territory he had mastered, and even that was not very clear.

Su Yu mused and looked at Wan Tiansheng. "Principal, you should be able to see clearly the path you've opened, right?"

Wan Tiansheng nodded.

Su Yu understood and sighed. "I see. As for the pen dao I've integrated, I know how much I've merged, but in reality, even this small segment has many corners and details I haven't explored or considered. It's not a complete comprehension of this segment of the pen dao!"

Su Yu laughed, "I've been focusing too much on the road ahead, neglecting the details. The Heaven Gate has provided me with great assistance, but it has also created some drawbacks, like forcing growth prematurely!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded again. "The Heaven Gate is indeed a formidable thing, allowing one to see through the essence of the great dao! In any era, it's a symbol of invincibility! However, even those who open the Heaven Gate possess varying strengths. Some, like you, might see through the essence but overlook many things, ultimately becoming overconfident and unable to go far."

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. "Yes, I understand now! The Martial Emperor! The Martial Emperor is considered a failure. He opened the Heaven Gate, probably earlier than the Culture King and others, yet among them, even the Martial King could easily suppress him! If I'm not mistaken, the Human Emperor, the Culture King, the Martial King, the Control King, and the Radiant King all opened the Heaven Gate! The Martial Emperor should be weaker than the four kings, even though he is their senior. Perhaps he also failed to fully comprehend his path... A brute is just a brute!"

Su Yu felt deeply moved. Some of his previous thoughts suddenly became clear. He wondered why the Martial Emperor was so miserable, being suppressed and unable to defeat the Martial King, even after opening the Heaven Gate. Su Yu had thought that those who opened the Heaven Gate should be peerless.

Now he understood. The Martial Emperor might also have failed to fully comprehend his path. Perhaps he didn't even open his own path but merged with a strong one he saw, just like Su Yu was doing with the pen dao now! Once Su Yu mastered the pen dao, he might not be able to strengthen it further or open his own path, as all his energy would be focused on merging with the dao, leaving no time to open a new path!

Even if he opened a path, he might disdain it for being too small or weak, having seen the grandeur of mountains, he might not appreciate a mere hill.

Wan Tiansheng, seeing Su Yu's enlightenment, smiled. "You're a smart person, not like the Martial Emperor, who is clearly a brute! Opening the Heaven Gate isn't limited to just a few people, but there are strong and weak ones, indicating that everyone's comprehension is different!"

Su Yu nodded and then curiously asked, "Principal, you haven't opened the Heaven Gate, nor have you perfected your divine and source apertures. Why is your strength so formidable?"

"No, it's not that we're strong; it's that you're currently weak," Wan Tiansheng shook his head. "Your potential will certainly surpass mine! There's no doubt about it! At the same level, I shouldn't be your match, but as you said, it's at the same level. You haven't reached that stage yet with your current path integration."

"Oh!" Su Yu chuckled, "The principal is indeed knowledgeable! I was also puzzled. There are so many old antiques among the various races, yet none seem as knowledgeable as the principal, who has only lived for a century."

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "You're only 21. How do you rate your knowledge?"

"Not bad!"

"And compared to your peers?"

"Of course, my knowledge is superior. I've studied the myriad races' techniques, witnessed the strong across the Myriad Realms, explored ancient times, traversed the realms of life and death, and delved into the essence of the great dao. At the same age, others are still striving for the Skysoar Realm, while I've already seen through the essence of the great dao..."

"Isn't that the point?"

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Nowadays, the myriad realms are mostly mediocre! Some old antiques either slumber or spend their days thinking only of slaughter and becoming stronger, focusing solely on strength without pondering why they can become stronger or what they will do after becoming stronger. They simply want to become stronger! Such thoughts are mere wishful thinking!"

"For example, when they integrate with the dao, what do you think their first thought is on how to become stronger?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, "To kill other dao integrators!"

"Exactly!" Wan Tiansheng laughed, "That's the thought of mediocrities!"

Su Yu felt awkward. He had thought the same. Was he being criticized?

"What does the principal think?"

"Me?" Wan Tiansheng pondered and said, "To seize comprehension!"

Su Yu frowned, and Wan Tiansheng explained, "A path shared by ten people, you occupy one-tenth. This doesn't mean others have taken your share; it means the other nine have different comprehensions! This path represents ten kinds of comprehension, and you've only grasped one. At this moment, you should comprehend what others have grasped that you haven't! When your comprehension surpasses others, you can instantly seize everything from them, pushing them out, and your control over the power of laws will be stronger than theirs!"

Su Yu understood, "That's the strength of a master of rules, because they comprehend more. When you compete for the power of laws with them, it's like an egg hitting a rock; they can easily push you out!"

"Exactly!" Wan Tiansheng continued, "Take the pen dao, for instance. If you master it, you might think you're the master of rules, and no one can take your pen dao. However, the Culture King's comprehension might be deeper than yours! He doesn't need to master the pen dao, but he can instantly seize it, taking over your comprehension control... At that time, you'd be a lamb to the slaughter!"

Su Yu nodded again, "Makes sense. So, the principal's suggestion is for me to find an opportunity to get rid of the Culture King? To sow discord between us?"

"..." Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "How could that be!"

"Is the principal still holding a grudge?"

"Impossible!"      Su Yu laughed, "It must be! Otherwise, why bring up the Culture King out of nowhere?"

"Just a reminder!" 

Su Yu chuckled but accepted the advice, "The principal is right. I'll think about it carefully! I don't want to end up like the Martial Emperor, who, despite having exceptional talent and opening the Heaven Gate, met a tragic end!"

"Indeed, the Martial Emperor is somewhat of a failure." Wan Tiansheng nodded.

The two, both with Daofuse-level combat power, were evaluating a master of rules, who might still be quite formidable. Losing to the Martial King didn't mean the Martial Emperor couldn't defeat other masters of rules. After all, he had opened the Heaven Gate.

But in Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng's view, precisely because he opened the Heaven Gate, he shouldn't be so weak, being defeated by juniors.

...

A moment later.

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng tore through the void and emerged from the River of Time. Simultaneously, golden clouds and dark clouds appeared in the sky. Wan Tiansheng looked at Su Yu, wondering if he should avoid them.

Su Yu thought for a moment and shook his head. "Calamities are also a form of comprehension. Principal, don't worry. One punishment isn't enough to deplete anything."

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "Then I'll also comprehend the coexistence of reward and punishment!"

The next moment, he stepped into the void. Golden clouds and blood clouds flew toward him. Wan Tiansheng suppressed the blood clouds with his left hand and absorbed the golden clouds with his right, quietly comprehending. His left hand transformed into a giant palm, suppressing the blood clouds with a rumble!

The punishment of rules targeted those who proved their dao at the Sunmoon Realm. The main target of the punishment was those transitioning from Sunmoon to Eternal, with a killing power at most equivalent to the fourth or fifth stage of Eternal. Of course, Wan Tiansheng was too strong, so this punishment might have the power of the sixth or seventh stage.

However, for Wan Tiansheng, it was too weak! He comprehended the golden clouds, smiled, and with a casual swipe, shattered the blood clouds completely.

Below, the soldiers were dumbfounded. The Eternal experts, however, were quite solemn. The blood clouds were not weak. They were quite powerful! Yet Wan Tiansheng easily shattered them. What was his current strength?

Even the Great Zhou King frowned, looking at Wan Tiansheng, feeling as if he had encountered a rival. Wan Tiansheng had become Eternal! Truly Eternal! He seemed to be opening a path rather than merging with one. Such an existence had no concept of Daofuse; he was simply a pure Eternal expert.

Moments later, Wan Tiansheng descended. Standing beside Su Yu, he looked at the Great Zhou King and smiled gently, "Greetings, Great Zhou King. I was in a hurry earlier and forgot to pay my respects. Please forgive my rudeness."

"You're too kind!" The Great Zhou King nodded slightly. Wan Tiansheng smiled, "It's only right! You've protected the Human Race for many years. Now that Emperor Yu has established the Purification Bureau and entrusted me with important duties, I have many things to consult with you on, including capturing the Upper Realm traitors. You're familiar with the Upper Realm, and I hope you'll assist me in tracking down those traitors soon!"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "I will. I'll tell you everything I know."

Wan Tiansheng nodded again, "Thank you, senior. If Emperor Yu unites the Myriad Realms again, your contributions will be monumental and should be recorded as rules, remembered for ten thousand years, leaving a legacy of honor! Let the Human Race for countless generations know of your contributions."

The Great Zhou King's mouth twitched, "You're exaggerating. I'm just an ordinary member of the Human Race..."

"No, it must be recorded!"

Chapter 700: The Decision of the Fate Emperor

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "The Great Zhou King assisted Emperor Yu in restoring order. It was also the Great Zhou King who supported Emperor Yu's ascension to the position of Holy Lord, suppressing all voices of dissent. Emperor Yu has been diligent and capable, slaying several Daofuse experts on his first day, ushering in a golden age for the Human Race! The Great Zhou King's foresight is unparalleled! Even I never imagined Emperor Yu could achieve so much!"

He continued with a smile, "In the future, should there be any treacherous ministers or thieves attempting to usurp the destiny of the Human Race, we will once again rely on the Great Zhou King to restore order and uphold the orthodoxy of the Human Race!"

Orthodoxy?

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath and nodded after a long pause, "I will."

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "The Great Zhou King naturally understands my words. In times of great chaos, sages must emerge! All that is decayed and backward should be swept into the trash heap, cleansed to reveal a bright new world! This tide is a new beginning; everything is new!"

The Great Zhou King sighed and nodded again, "I understand!"

"Great Zhou King, forgive my outburst; I was merely expressing my feelings!"

Wan Tiansheng beamed, glancing around before bowing slightly, "In the past, when I executed your descendants, it was my mistake. Everything has its rules and laws! I was not an enforcer back then, yet I acted as one... my mistake was overstepping my authority!"

It was merely overstepping; he did not believe he had killed the wrong people.

"According to the laws at the time, overstepping authority should be punished..."

Wan Tiansheng extended his hand, and suddenly, thousands of swords manifested in the void, instantly piercing his body with a continuous sound of slicing flesh. His body was riddled with swords, leaving only his head untouched.

Nearby, some Eternals' expressions changed.

Below, exclamations of shock echoed.

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly, while Su Yu remained silent.

Wan Tiansheng's face turned pale, his body pierced by countless swords, yet he smiled, "I have been punished! I have received the punishment of the law, and this matter no longer weighs on my conscience! In the future, I will not feel guilty or blame myself for this. Whether you are willing or not, public matters are public, and private matters are private! If there are still grievances, settle them privately, without regard to status!"

He had punished himself, casting off his shackles!

He did not believe he had killed wrongly, only that it was not his place to kill.

And now, it was.

Silence reigned.

After a long time, Su Yu spoke, "Director Wan, everyone, let the past be the past! If there is private vengeance, issue a challenge, whether for sparring or a life-and-death duel, I will not interfere!"

"For cultivators, private duels and battles are their own responsibility!"

"Moreover, a new year brings new changes. In just over a month, the Anping Calendar year 352 will end!"

"Next year, the era will change, and the Anping Calendar will finally conclude at 352 years! The world is no longer peaceful, and next year, we will begin the New Yu Era!"

A group of people felt a stir in their hearts at the change of era.

The New Yu Era!

Su Yu said calmly, "A new year brings new changes, a new world, new policies, a new beginning! The old can be cherished, but do not dwell in the past!"

"Long live Emperor Yu!"

Wan Tiansheng bowed, and below, the million soldiers, indifferent to the change of era, now shouted in unison, "Long live Emperor Yu!"

The Anping Calendar was coming to an end!

The era of the prefecture's founding, over 350 years, and nearly a century of warfare before its founding, was about to officially end in a month.

Only a few understood that Su Yu was telling everyone that not only the Anping Calendar but also the ancient and previous nine tides were all ending!

At this moment, the destiny of the Human Race surged!

In the next moment, the destiny of the Human Race grew even stronger, and above the Human Realm, Su Yu's projection suddenly became much clearer, rapidly spreading across the entire Human Realm.

...

At this moment, in the skies of various realms, the projections of powerful figures appeared once more.

What was Su Yu up to again?

Day after day, he never seemed to rest.

...

Human Realm.

Emperor Yu's Palace.

Su Yu no longer lingered in the Eastern Rift Valley.

At this moment, only a few people were in the grand hall. Lan Tian appeared with a playful smile, but upon seeing the dignified Su Yu, the solemn Great Zhou King, and the pale Wan Tiansheng, his smile gradually faded. He cautiously sat beside Wan Tiansheng, sitting upright and proper.

Seeing Lan Tian arrive, Su Yu did not smile, fearing that if he smiled at Lan Tian, Lan Tian would immediately smile back, which he could not bear.

Be serious!

Discuss serious matters!

Su Yu quickly said, "Currently, there are two urgent matters! First, the positioning seal must be swiftly put in place!"

"Second, the Death Realm requires a strong Human Realm expert who can instantly seal the fluctuations of death energy..."

Su Yu briefly explained and continued, "It's best if the aura isn't too strong, or it might easily cause turmoil in the Death Realm. The Great Zhou King's method of shielding is excellent, and he also possesses the power of teleportation, allowing us to quickly intercept any escape!"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "As for the previous plan, where I would seal the small realm..."

"Leave it to the Great Ming King!"

Su Yu replied slowly, "The Great Ming King is about to reach Daofuse; he will seal the realm from the outside! I must go to the Death Realm; otherwise, I cannot open the passage!"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and nodded, "I understand!"

Su Yu said no more and looked at Wan Tiansheng, "After the Great Zhou King leaves, Director Wan will oversee the situation to prevent any unrest!"

"Understood."

Wan Tiansheng remained calm.

Su Yu then turned to Lan Tian, "Deputy Director Lan, be cautious and make sure to hide the Grand Seal of the Prefecture well. It holds significant Human Race destiny! Moreover, it must be buried very close to Daofuse but must not be discovered, and it can only be buried once. Otherwise, if it's used repeatedly, even a fool would know there's a problem!"

Seeing the seriousness of those around him, Lan Tian could only respond seriously, "Understood!"

"Then let's not delay. I'll gather the Hou Race and Iron Devourer Race Daofuse experts to prepare for a covert assault on the Fate Realm! Director Wan, Great Zhou King, this operation is not primarily for killing Daofuse experts. Of course, if we can kill one or two without losses, that's acceptable! Act according to the situation! If there's a risk of casualties, abandon the idea of a forced kill!"

"Everyone, follow my instructions and do not act rashly!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "I hope to lead everyone to the Upper Realm intact, rather than trading the lives of our Daofuse experts for ten of theirs. Even if it's five, three, or even one, it's unacceptable!"

"If I can achieve victory without losses, then there's no need to sacrifice Daofuse lives. The idea of trading one for ten is nonsense in my eyes! Losing even one Daofuse expert now would weaken my strength. How would we conquer the Upper Realm?"

The Great Zhou King hesitated but ultimately remained silent.

He felt Su Yu was overly concerned with these matters.

Is it really possible to avoid casualties?

Su Yu was unconcerned. If his side were weak, there would be no choice, but his side currently dominated the lower realm. As long as the plan was executed smoothly, avoiding casualties was entirely feasible!

"Enough talk. I'll go find people. Once the Daofuse experts of various races are drawn out, Lan Tian, you must act immediately!"

"Understood!"

...

The conversation ended quickly, and Su Yu had no intention of staying longer, as Lan Tian seemed eager to chat with him.

As for taking Lan Tian to see the Great Dao, Su Yu had considered it, but now was not the right time. He was mainly worried that if Lan Tian grew stronger now, it might easily cause fluctuations in his avatars, potentially exposing those hidden among the myriad races.

The possibility was high because Su Yu had discovered that Lan Tian's Dao principles might all be interconnected.

Lan Tian's situation could only be addressed once it stabilized, allowing him to take him to see the Great Dao.

...

Soon.

In the Iron Devourer Realm, the Iron Devourer Emperor met with Su Yu, and three days later, they would jointly launch a surprise attack on the Fate Realm!

Not only the Iron Devourer Realm, but the Hou Realm and Space Ancient Beast Realm also received the message.

Only the Ancient Giant Race was left out, as Su Yu didn't bother with them.

Three Beast Emperors, along with Su Yu himself, and the Great Zhou King would also participate, while Wan Tiansheng would oversee the border of the Human Realm. Su Yu also went to Grand Dream City to call upon the Book Spirit and Tea Plant, and made a trip to the Devourer Ancient Realm.

This time, he planned to deploy ten Daofuse experts, including himself and Wan Tiansheng.

As for the Great Qin King and others, they would remain in Grand Dream City as a precaution, ready to provide support at any time!

The Fate Realm currently had two Daofuse experts on the surface.

Su Yu didn't know if that was true, nor did he care.

He wouldn't attack directly!

Because, apart from the Human Race, others would face suppression. Attacking directly would be foolish.

The assault on the Fate Realm would only occur from the outside.

The myriad races would surely come to its aid!

Even if they didn't, they would threaten the Human Realm, forcing Su Yu and his forces to return.

...

While Su Yu prepared to attack the Fate Realm.

Fate Realm.

Heaven's Fate Mountain.

The Fate Emperor calculated with his fingers, and after a moment, blood marks appeared on his hands. He calmly restored them.

Glancing at the sky, he sighed inwardly.

Trouble seemed to be approaching.

Whether it was the Human Race or the Upper Realm, this tide would not allow the Fate Race to remain neutral!

"It's time to make a decision, the last one!"

The Fate Emperor's heart was heavy. This time, he would make a decision.

The choice of the Fate Race was crucial.

The gate to the Upper Realm was in the Fate Realm, and it suppressed other races. Whoever controlled the Fate Realm would hold the advantage. If the Fate Realm sided with the Human Race, the myriad races would surely attack.

And if they sided with the myriad races, the Human Race would eventually come. It was only a matter of time.
