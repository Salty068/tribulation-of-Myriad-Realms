Chapter 666: Insidious Su Yu!

To Su Yu, who had opened his Heaven Gate, the battles between Great Daos held no secrets.

What the West King's Consort considered a hidden attack, Su Yu saw with perfect clarity.

How your Great Dao fluctuated, where you intended to strike, who you aimed for, whether it was a feint or a hidden burst of power…

The Great Qin King and Great Xia King, currently locked in fierce combat, found it incredibly difficult to perceive these things.

With Great Daos entangled, constantly fluctuating, and bursts of aura erupting everywhere, how could they discern the state of the Great Daos and defend themselves?

Su Yu knew everything like the back of his hand!
