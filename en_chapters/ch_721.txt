Chapter 721: Summoning the Generals to Slay the Heavenly King

The pen dao advanced once more.

At this moment, Su Yu sat cross-legged beneath the torrent, absorbing countless strands of the power of laws, his aura growing stronger with each breath. The benefit of comprehending the Great Dao lay precisely in this: once you grasped it, your realm would rise, allowing you to absorb more of the power of laws and rapidly strengthen yourself.

In Chaos Mountain, Su Yu had encountered those ancient beasts. Their progress was much slower. Without a clear path through the Great Dao, they were a tangled mess, requiring painstaking effort to advance.

"Do I have the strength of a Heavenly King now?"

After a long while, Su Yu opened his eyes, a gleam of sharpness flashing within. Could he now rival a Heavenly King? Without having fought one, it was hard to say. However, he could feel that his control over the power of the Great Dao had increased by another three percent. Though it seemed a small improvement, at the later stages of the pen dao, even a slight advancement was a significant leap.

Su Yu sat in meditation, digesting his recent gains. Soon, he rose and flew toward the passage to the lower realm. The flow of time between the upper and lower realms should be the same, but within the River of Time, it was hard to be certain. He hoped not too much time had passed, as they had agreed to meet in an hour.

...

In the lower realm, some time had indeed passed. Wan Tiansheng had been waiting with a thousand pages for three hours. Su Yu had promised to return in an hour, but he had yet to appear. The Fate Emperor seemed a bit worried, softly asking, "Could Emperor Yu have encountered some trouble?"

After all, the Land of Dao Source was currently under the control of the myriad races. It seemed unlikely that Su Yu could have taken it over. Even though the Fate Emperor didn't know exactly how many powerful beings resided there, he understood that there could be as many as ten Heavenly Kings.

Wan Tiansheng remained calm, saying, "Be patient!" It had only been three hours. If Su Yu hadn't made a move in three days, then he would worry and consider taking people to the upper realm to find him. For now, he could wait. He had weathered many storms; a few hours of absence was nothing.

As they spoke, the space around them fluctuated. Wan Tiansheng grew serious, remaining silent. The Fate Emperor did the same, refraining from making contact in case it wasn't Su Yu but someone else.

After a moment, a face began to form in the void, clearer than before, and Su Yu's features became discernible. In this short time, Su Yu's strength had grown considerably. Of course, neither Wan Tiansheng nor the Fate Emperor thought much of it. They were just relieved that Su Yu had finally appeared.

Sure enough, the next moment, Su Yu's voice came from the void, "Is Director Wan there?"

"I'm here!" Wan Tiansheng responded, quickly producing a compressed book in his hand. He asked solemnly, "Shall I send it up directly?"

"Hold on!" At that moment, the spatial passage began to fluctuate violently. Lightning flickered! Just then, a massive stone seal appeared in the passage, suppressing it. The lightning extinguished, and the fluctuations dissipated.

Su Yu's voice rang out, "Send it up!"

Wan Tiansheng threw the compressed book with force, and it traveled unimpeded along the path. Below, the Fate Emperor watched with flickering eyes. It was suppressed! What was that? He didn't know what the stone seal was, but he knew it must be a treasure. The upper realm passage, which posed a life-threatening danger even to Heavenly Kings descending, was subdued by a mere stone seal!

Boom!

In the next instant, the book vanished, and the small stone disappeared. Lightning erupted swiftly! However, Su Yu's figure was already gone. He had retreated! The passage above gradually calmed down, the speed astonishing.

Soon, the passage vanished. Both Wan Tiansheng and the Fate Emperor breathed a sigh of relief. The Fate Emperor asked softly, "Director Wan, do you think Emperor Yu's claim that the upper realm is filled with treasures is credible?"

He wasn't entirely ignorant of the upper realm's situation. There were treasures, but not to the extent of being everywhere. Even if they were, the human race in the upper realm was hunted by all. How could they seize treasures? Moreover, how had Su Yu reached the vicinity of the upper realm's gate?

At this moment, the Fate Emperor was both surprised and puzzled, with a hint of admiration. Truly impressive! In just half a month, he had even reached the upper realm's gate. Clearly, Su Yu had ventured into the Land of Dao Source, the lair of the myriad races' ancient beings. His own clan's Destiny Marquis was likely there as well.

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "For him, treasures are everywhere. But if we were to go, perhaps danger would be everywhere instead!"

"Indeed." The Fate Emperor nodded slightly, then asked, "Director, what do you think the current situation in the upper realm is?"

"I'm not sure." Wan Tiansheng laughed lightly, "No rush. Since Emperor Yu has gone up and doesn't seem to be planning a quick return, the situation should be manageable. Otherwise, he would have come down already."

Su Yu hadn't reported any bad news, which meant it was likely mostly good news. He just didn't bother to share it now. The Fate Emperor nodded, glancing at the sky and then into the distance. He said softly, "Recently, I've sensed slight changes in the Three Realms. Perhaps some new Daofuse experts have emerged?"

The Three Realms were sealed, but the Fate Emperor, observing the heavenly mechanisms, could sense that the aura of the Three Realms had grown stronger, even without a detailed examination. It had only been half a month since Su Yu left, and the emergence of new Daofuse experts in the Three Realms was not a good sign.

Wan Tiansheng, however, was unconcerned, saying softly, "It's normal. In times of crisis, there are always breakthroughs! When Emperor Yu returns, whether to clear the Three Realms or take other actions, we can decide then. There's no need to provoke them now."

"Then I'll follow Director Wan's lead." The Fate Emperor said no more. Su Yu was thriving in the upper realm, so there was no need to worry excessively about these matters.

...

Meanwhile, in the Human Emperor's River, Su Yu was swiftly integrating the pages into his Mark of Civilization. These pages were of low grade, merely earth-tier, much weaker than the divine weapons Su Yu now wielded. This time, Wan Tiansheng had sent a thousand pages!

Su Yu was in a good mood. After integrating the pages, he quickly headed downstream. Though physically and mentally exhausted, his good spirits masked it all.

"Time to fleece the Human Emperor's wool!" Su Yu's steps were light as he set off to gather more unclaimed power of laws, even the power of attribute Daos. This was faster than extracting from the Great Dao buried in the River of Time, where he had to absorb quietly. Here, he could absorb freely.

Su Yu moved swiftly toward the breach, passing the area where the Hundred Battle King was sealed. The king seemed to sense something and struggled briefly, but the presence vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving him agitated and silent. He even doubted his own senses.

Soon, Su Yu reached the breach and jumped down! Though he might not be able to ascend later, he could tear through the grid to escape when needed!

...

Atop the grid, Su Yu began by using the pages to absorb the power of laws, nurturing them. The power of laws here was abundant, and soon the pages began to strengthen. With the Mark of Civilization as the core, these pages were auxiliary, and as the core grew stronger, so did the potential of the pages.

Gradually, each page began to evolve toward the level of a Heavenly Soldier. Su Yu also started seeking smaller attribute Daos to incorporate into his pages. He avoided the stronger ones, fearing they might overwhelm his Mark of Civilization. The weaker ones sufficed.

Small attribute Daos, resembling little dragons, were devoured by Su Yu's pages. Some were tiny, barely larger than a loach. Such Dao powers, if passed down, could only serve as embryonic forms of the Great Dao. Anyone who fused with such a Dao would likely be the weakest Eternal, and any master of such a Dao would probably be the weakest ruler of laws, possibly even weaker than an Eternal.

Of course, Su Yu didn't mind. He only needed to keep devouring, absorbing them into his Mark of Civilization, crafting a true page for each Dao, a world within each page! When myriad Daos converged, he would merge them into a cosmic civilization Dao, opening his own Great Dao!

At that time, these Dao powers would naturally grow stronger. For now, Su Yu was happily pilfering. If left unattended, the myriad races might wait millennia for new unclaimed rules and Daos to descend. Meanwhile, the Mark of Civilization grew ever stronger.

Currently, Su Yu's weapons of choice were often the Culture Tomb or the Human Lord Seal. However, his own Dao-proving weapon, the Mark of Civilization, had been set aside, partly because it was suppressing powerful beings and partly because it wasn't strong enough. Now, it was rapidly growing!

...

Within the sealed space of the Mark of Civilization, the West King's Consort frowned slightly. What was Su Yu doing? She couldn't sense much, but she felt the space around her growing more stable. If there had been hope of breaking the seal before, now it seemed increasingly solid, and her connection to her Dao power felt more distant, almost beyond reach.

"Has Su Yu's strength improved again, or has the treasure suppressing me grown stronger?" The West King's Consort frowned. And had the black jade been delivered?

"Perhaps the time has been too short, and he hasn't had a chance to act." It hadn't been long since Su Yu last visited her, and he might not have contacted the upper realm yet.

"No rush, I'll wait a bit longer!" She mused, recalling Su Yu's mention of the Immortal Battle Marquis being blocked from descending, possibly due to a powerful clan member sensing something amiss and taking action. She held a faint hope that her clan would come to her rescue!

Who would come, I wonder?

As these thoughts crossed his mind, he couldn't help but sneer inwardly at the confident demeanor of Su Yu. "Su Yu, you're still too naive, too young! This world is far more complex than you imagine. Our race has countless powerful beings. Do you really think that just because I'm a Heavenly King, I'm the strongest in our clan?"

"Well, as long as he doesn't kill himself, there's still a chance!" The West King's Consort decided not to concern herself further. If the space was being reinforced, so be it. She had no immediate plans to escape, and in truth, it would be exceedingly difficult.

...

On the back of the book cover, there was another space. At this moment, two individuals were being suppressed within it. Wen Qi had initially tried to break through the space, but now, feeling the space strengthening, he said despondently, "Marquis, there's no way to break through."

The space was becoming increasingly formidable!

Marquis Zhennan frowned. "What exactly are these people trying to do?"

Without any provocation, they had been captured. Upon entering, he found that Wen Qi had arrived even earlier than he did.

Wen Qi sighed, "I have no idea. They didn't even give me a chance to speak. I thought they would ask me something, but they didn't ask anything and just imprisoned me!"

Marquis Zhennan furrowed his brows and, after a long pause, said in a low voice, "The other side has the Human Lord Seal and can wield the pen dao. It's likely someone from the lower realm, a successor of the Culture King!"

Even if it was a successor of the Culture King, capturing him without a word was infuriating for Marquis Zhennan. How did this Human Lord from the lower realm even get here, and why did they capture him directly? He didn't even know the other party!

The two exchanged a glance, both feeling helpless. There was no escape; they were trapped. Where on earth was this place? If it was a weapon space, it hadn't felt this strong before. Why was it getting stronger?

Now, they could clearly feel the suppression growing more powerful, and their connection to the external Great Dao was becoming weaker and weaker, to the point where they could barely sense it. If it continued, they wouldn't even need to be sealed; they would be reduced to the Sunmoon Realm.

...

Within the small Mark of Civilization, three powerful beings were sealed. Su Yu had often remarked that others liked to seal powerful beings, and he was no different. Sometimes, sealing was more advantageous than killing.

This time, Su Yu truly had no idea how long he had stayed. He had devoured countless powers of laws, strengthening the pages of the book. Many pages had even reached the level of Heavenly Soldiers, and Su Yu continuously integrated numerous treasures to fortify his pages.

He hadn't brought many treasures with him this time. But after killing Daofuse cultivators and destroying Dragon City, he had acquired plenty of treasures. Su Yu had no intention of keeping them, so he threw them into the pages as materials to strengthen them.

The Mark of Civilization was accumulating more and more golden patterns. Gradually, it even began to show 170 golden patterns. Even with 170 golden patterns, the Mark of Civilization still felt lacking in lethality, despite being a top-tier existence among divine weapons. Yet, Su Yu didn't care.

The Mark of Civilization hadn't reached its point of transformation yet. When that day came, Su Yu believed it would be terrifyingly powerful. One page, one world! That would be the day when the Mark of Civilization truly became immensely powerful.

Once he had nearly exhausted the stock on the grid, Su Yu finally took a deep breath, smiled, and prepared to leave. At this moment, a demonic aura emanated from him. With a hint of the Demon Race's scent, his visage blurred as he tore through the grid with a claw and swiftly slipped out!

...

Boom!

When Su Yu emerged, he was momentarily stunned to find that the battle was still ongoing. Moreover, it seemed to be the same people as before! Of course, the Immortal Race seemed to be gone, either killed or fled.

However, the Great Dao power that had previously emerged now seemed to have a new owner, in the hands of the Demon Race. Su Yu sensed it!

At this moment, the Demon Race had two individuals. Opposing them were two from the God Race, one from the Phoenix Race, and one from the Nether Race. A dog-eat-dog situation!

Seeing Su Yu appear, the few individuals were also taken aback. A strong Demon Race member? Just seven or eight hours ago, an Immortal Race expert had come and fled. The two Immortals couldn't defeat them and eventually chose to abandon the Great Dao and escape.

Now, a Demon Race member had arrived. And he seemed very powerful! A top-tier Demon Race expert? Was he also interested in this Great Dao power? But today, only a common, incomplete Great Dao had appeared. Would such a strong individual care about an incomplete Great Dao?

"My lord!" The two Demon Race experts were delighted. Though puzzled about which expert this was, the Dao Source Land was filled with ancient beings, and even their own races found it hard to know how many experts were hidden there.

Just like the Human Race, they didn't know if there were any Human Race experts still slumbering in the Dao Source Land.

"Six..." Su Yu glanced around. Six Daofuse cultivators. If he joined forces with the two Demon Race members now, they might be able to take down the others. But upon closer inspection... Su Yu cursed inwardly.

They all seemed to have some strength left. It wasn't a fight to the death! These guys in the Dao Source Land were just playing house! Su Yu thought it over and roughly understood. There was a lot of unclaimed power of laws here, and Great Daos often appeared. If they fought to the death every time, killing several Daofuse cultivators each time, they would have all died out long ago.

Over the years, the strong ones here probably had some sort of understanding. They called it a struggle, but it was more of a sparring match, with little chance of a deadly fight. Especially today, with only an incomplete Great Dao power, it wasn't worth fighting to the death. A complete, powerful Great Dao might be different.

"If I go all out... that would be unexpected!" Su Yu grumbled to himself, then snorted coldly, "A bunch of ignorant juniors, scram! You're disturbing my rest. For an incomplete Great Dao, go fight somewhere else!"

Sure enough, upon hearing this, although Su Yu didn't join the battle, the Daofuse cultivators didn't seem too surprised. Clearly, this one wasn't interested in getting involved. The two Demon Race experts were a bit disappointed and helpless, but they quickly took the opportunity to escape.

Too bad they didn't recognize him! If they did, they might have asked this expert for help. This one was probably a quasi-king level expert.

Su Yu watched them leave, frowning slightly. They really listened! In a life-and-death struggle, they probably wouldn't be so obedient, leaving just because they were told to. Clearly, these guys were treating it as a normal contest for resources.

"In that case, even if I throw out ten or eight incomplete Great Daos, it would be hard to make these guys fight to the death. The disputes between the races are all kept within certain limits, probably due to some agreements among the higher-ups."

A bit disappointed, Su Yu had indeed planned to do just that. Throw out some incomplete Great Daos and let them fight to the death! Thinking about this, Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate and scanned the surroundings, secretly shocked.

In just this small area, besides the few Daofuse cultivators just now, he could still see traces of two more Daofuse cultivators' Great Daos. He continued scanning, and suddenly, his expression changed.

In the distance, atop a high mountain, a powerful Great Dao power was fluctuating. Just as Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate to investigate, the Great Dao suddenly rippled, and a faint voice spread along the Great Dao power towards Su Yu: "Which fellow Daoist is spying on me? Fellow Daoist, it's quite improper to pry into others' secrets!"

Su Yu quickly vanished from where he stood, his heart pounding with fear. What kind of power was this? Opening the Heaven Gate to spy on Great Dao power, this was the first time someone had sensed him.

That was a high mountain, and on it was a supreme expert. Su Yu hadn't looked closely, but he knew there was an absolute top-tier expert on that mountain!

"Close to a master of rules?" "Or what?"

Su Yu was shocked. So strong! He had reached this level, opened the Heaven Gate to spy, and still got discovered. Luckily, the distance was vast. Otherwise, the other party might have traced him back directly.

"I underestimated the people of the world!" Su Yu had always thought that with his Heaven Gate open, he was invincible. Today, with his strength advancing further, he believed that even in the Upper Realm, he could see whoever he wanted. But now, Su Yu realized he was wrong. Even with the power of a Heavenly King, opening the Heaven Gate could still get him discovered!

...

Just as Su Yu fled, the expert atop the high mountain—who had sensed some disturbance when Su Yu first arrived and entered the River of Time—opened his eyes and looked around.

With a heroic spirit, he appeared young, but his gaze was ancient. His long, purple-red hair trailed on the ground as he sat cross-legged, seemingly growing into the stone, as if it hadn't moved for countless years.

One must know, the Human Race lost control of the Dao Source Land only six thousand years ago. Yet, seeing his hair grown into the stone, he might have been here for more than six thousand years.

"Just entered the quasi-king realm, huh?" "Daring to spy on my Great Dao... quite bold."

The purple-haired expert murmured, "Is it the Fate Clan's Eye of Heaven? Or the God Clan's Three-Eyed Divine Pupil? Or perhaps the Immortal Clan's Eye of the Great Dao?"

The purple-haired expert mused to himself, remaining concealed. Moreover, to make his Great Dao react, it was likely no ordinary technique.

"If one speaks of spying techniques... the Heaven Gate is the best in the world... but alas, no one can open the Heaven Gate anymore."

Murmuring, the purple-haired expert closed his eyes again. Forget it, just entered the quasi-king realm, full of self-importance, thinking no one in the world could restrain him, standing at the pinnacle of the Myriad Realms, with a heart to overlook the world, spying on all sides. It wasn't surprising.

"Quasi-king... ultimately, it's just the Daofuse Realm." Shaking his head slightly, the purple-haired youth fell silent. Eternal, Daofuse, quasi-king... no matter how close to a master of rules, it was still the Daofuse Realm.

After the ancient times, was there really no way to step into the realm of a master of rules? The purple-haired youth pondered in his heart. What was missing for this step?

He looked towards a distant valley. There, before Su Yu entered, another expert had opened his eyes and looked around. Now, the purple-haired youth gazed in that direction, pondering. Did he know what was missing for this step?

...

In the valley, the expert who seemed almost one with the earth suddenly opened his eyes, as if looking at the distant high mountain, without speaking. He merely watched for a moment before closing his eyes again.

Master of rules! Ten thousand years of time, the world turning, the myriad races contending, strong ones coming and going, yet why has no one ever stepped into that realm?

"Why is it that despite having enough comprehension and power of laws, I still can't take that final step?" 

The thought echoed in the mind of the powerful being buried beneath the earth. He felt he was just a hair's breadth away, yet that final step remained elusive. Was it the Human Emperor or someone else who was preventing the emergence of a new master of laws?

A soft sigh reverberated through the valley as he closed his eyes once more. Perhaps when the tides shift and the lower realms open again, he might feel something different. Maybe it was time for him to descend and see for himself. The Upper Realm, though grand, had begun to feel increasingly hollow over the years.

"Like the moon in a mirror, or flowers in water—visible yet unattainable..."

...

"Whoosh!"

Su Yu fled swiftly, heading towards the periphery with a heavy heart. The Source of the Dao was indeed fraught with danger. Just a casual glance had revealed peril.

"Truly ancient relics!"

Su Yu assessed the situation. Judging by the formidable aura of the great dao, it was likely not a pseudo-dao. Pseudo-dao would have been manageable. Even if it were a Heavenly King, Su Yu could suppress them by thirty percent. With his own Heavenly King-level strength, he wouldn't fear them. He could even handle two at once!

But if it were a true dao from the lower realms, Su Yu's only option would be to extract some unclaimed power of laws to prevent the opponent from recovering. Suppressing them would be a different story.

"Against pseudo-dao, this place is my domain. Against true dao... I can only say I have a slight advantage."

Su Yu mused, hoping that everyone here could acquire complete dao rules so he could switch paths. Those who changed paths were lovable; those who didn't, not so much.

Su Yu fled to the edge of the area. Now, he wasn't afraid. He continued to open the Heaven Gate, determined not to look in certain directions. He needed to observe the distribution of powerhouses throughout the Source of the Dao. If he encountered another powerhouse and was discovered, he could always flee the Source of the Dao.

He continued his observations, and soon, many strands of dao power appeared before his eyes.

"There are quite a few Daofuse cultivators!"

After a while, Su Yu inhaled sharply. How many Daofuse cultivators had emerged in this cursed place over the years? There were already plenty of Daofuse cultivators outside. But within the Source of the Dao, a quick glance revealed seven or eight, and including those he had seen in previous battles, there were fifteen or sixteen!

And this was only a small portion of what he had seen.

"Where is the Hundred Battle King?"

Su Yu's main goal was to locate where the Hundred Battle King was sealed. Perhaps he would have to attack that area. Although there were likely many Heavenly Kings there, Su Yu knew of six pseudo-dao powerhouses who were suppressing the Hundred Battle King, which actually constrained their power.

If Su Yu used the Stone Seal to suppress them further, they might not even match top-tier Daofuse cultivators. Killing a Heavenly King would be quite an achievement. Plus, it would show everyone that he was genuinely there to rescue the Hundred Battle King.

Being able to kill several Heavenly Kings while rescuing the Hundred Battle King... that was something the Human Race couldn't achieve.

"Didn't Marquis Giant Bamboo ask me to kill three Daofuse cultivators? I'll show you... and shock you, you big fat cat!"

Killing three Daofuse cultivators wouldn't be too difficult. However, the Iron Devourer Race shouldn't underestimate us!

In front of allies, Su Yu had to maintain absolute dominance!

Su Yu continued his observations. Suddenly, his expression changed again, and he fled swiftly. At the same time, a faint voice echoed, "Which fellow daoist dares to spy on my destiny? Our race is neutral and does not participate in any disputes... I advise you to think twice!"

As Su Yu fled, he realized who it was—Destiny Marquis! A powerhouse who had once even blocked the Hundred Battle King! Another peerless expert capable of detecting the Heaven Gate.

"One on the mountain, one in the sky..."

Destiny Marquis was in the sky. Su Yu saw him; the man seemed to have built a house out of clouds, hidden so deeply that ordinary powerhouses couldn't see it.

Su Yu fled frantically, his face showing a hint of gravity. This cursed place was truly difficult to spy on. The Heaven Gate had already been discovered twice.

Destiny Marquis was also close to the strength of a master of laws, as was the previous powerhouse.

"How many more of such existences are there?"

In a different location, Su Yu continued to open the Heaven Gate, determined to see how many powerhouses were in the Source of the Dao, even if it meant being discovered and pursued. He needed to know the numbers!

Otherwise, he wouldn't even know how he died.

With such powerhouses, sending others to gather intelligence was pointless. They wouldn't even be able to detect such existences! You could stand right in front of them and still not notice them.

"Marquis Zhennan and the others want to rescue someone... rescue my foot!"

Su Yu grumbled and continued his observations. This time, he seemed to see a large mountain. The next moment, his expression froze!

"So many!"

This time, he saw a gathering of powerhouses. Upon closer inspection, there were eight immensely powerful strands of dao power piercing the heavens and earth!

Su Yu looked closely and was shocked.

"The place where the Hundred Battle King is sealed!"

Among them, six strands of dao power were formidable but somewhat hollow in Su Yu's eyes. The other two strands were much more solid. Clearly, there were six pseudo-daos and two true daos.

"Eight powerhouses!"

"They're probably all Heavenly Kings..."

Su Yu exhaled. Impressive! With such a lineup, Marquis Zhennan dared to deceive the Iron Devourer Race into rescuing someone? Courting death!

The dao power of the Hundred Battle King was nowhere to be seen, likely completely sealed.

"Eight Heavenly Kings..."

Su Yu frowned. There were over ten Heavenly Kings in the Source of the Dao! Outside the Source of the Dao, each race had a few, with at least ten outside.

Su Yu's teeth ached. Wasn't it said that there weren't too many Heavenly Kings in the Upper Realm? Where did all these Heavenly Kings come from?

During the Hundred Battle King's era, there didn't seem to be many Heavenly Kings participating in the war.

"Have many people advanced in the past 6,000 years?"

Su Yu pondered, continuing to explore the surroundings. He needed to understand not only the strength of the powerhouses sealing the Hundred Battle King but also the distribution of powerhouses in the vicinity and escape routes. During his escape, he had to avoid top-tier powerhouses.

Otherwise, if he ran into those close to the strength of a master of laws, it would be disastrous.

Without the Heaven Gate, Su Yu felt that even a Heavenly King would fall here!

"Back then, did the Control King's lineage send someone to rescue him? How did they avoid detection? Or was the person they sent incredibly powerful, close to the strength of a master of laws?"

Continuing his exploration, Su Yu found that there were no people near the place where the Hundred Battle King was sealed. He swept through the area, and suddenly, his mouth twitched.

Just as he looked in that direction, everything went black, and a massive bamboo pole came crashing down on him.

Su Yu vanished swiftly!

The bamboo pole descended without a sound and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Silently and without a trace!

Having fled tens of thousands of meters away, Su Yu's face turned slightly pale. Damn! A giant bamboo pole! Seeing such a bamboo pole, he couldn't help but think of the Iron Devourer Race.

Don't tell me this powerhouse close to the strength of a master of laws is March from the Iron Devourer Race?

March seemed to be alive! January and February were both masters of laws, so it wasn't impossible for March to be close to that level!

...

In the distance, atop a large mountain covered in bamboo, a gigantic Iron Devourer Beast was munching on bamboo, looking somewhat clumsy. At this moment, it glanced in a certain direction, continuing to eat while pondering.

"A method of spying? The Fate Clan? The God Clan? The Immortal Clan? Or... the Human Clan?"

The massive Iron Devourer Beast continued eating, too lazy to think further.

If you look at me, I'll hit you!

...

"Impudent! Who dares to spy on me, you scoundrel?"

A furious shout assaulted Su Yu's mind.

Su Yu fled once more!

This was the second powerhouse he had discovered after March.

The Heaven Gate, which had been invincible, had been detected four times today!

Su Yu was helpless, almost in tears.

Could it be that all these guys had reached the level of a master of laws but were stuck at the peak of quasi-king because they couldn't break through?

"I can't keep looking..."

Su Yu had already surveyed the area around the sealed location, covering a thousand miles. The Source of the Dao was vast, and he hadn't finished looking. But he couldn't continue!

He had already encountered four top-tier existences. They might have sensed each other. If he continued, it might cause a commotion, and they might suspect something.

"Fortunately, there seem to be only these four nearby... If that giant bamboo is March, I don't need to worry. Since Destiny Marquis is neutral, he probably won't interfere. As for the remaining two... as long as I avoid them, there shouldn't be a big problem."

"However, if such powerhouses make a move, their speed will surely be extremely fast!"

"If they excel in spatial techniques, they might be even faster!"

...

Su Yu observed for a while, weighed his options, and quickly used the Little Stone to calm the light screen. Then he swiftly flew towards the outside world.

The Source of the Dao was too oppressive.

Too many powerhouses.

Even though Su Yu had just made some progress, he still felt a lingering fear.

This cursed place, though said to be his domain, was occupied by these guys. Reclaiming it wouldn't be easy.

...

Outside the Source of the Dao.

In a valley.

Marquis Yunshui and the others were still waiting.

It had been over a day since Su Yu entered.

And it had been nearly four days since Su Yu's agreement with the Iron Devourer Race.

A third of the ten-day limit had passed.

"Why hasn't he come out yet?"

Marquis Huoyun said impatiently, "I told you it's dangerous inside. What if something happened to him?"

Nearby, Lantian was sucking on a lollipop, glancing at him with a giggle, making Marquis Huoyun feel a bit uneasy. What are you laughing at? I didn't say anything wrong, just voicing a normal complaint.

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "Be patient. There hasn't been any major commotion inside, nor any sign of a Daofuse cultivator falling. There's no big problem."

"What if he's been captured?"

Marquis Huoyun quickly added, "I'm telling you, there are quite a few powerhouses inside, probably more than ten at the quasi-king level!"

"What about Su Yu..."

Lantian glanced at him again, and Marquis Huoyun cursed under his breath before quickly correcting himself, "That Emperor Yu, he's not yet at the quasi-king level. If he encounters a quasi-king... I'm afraid he won't be able to escape."

He spoke with a hint of irritation, "He shouldn't have gone to investigate alone. Even with the Heaven Gate, it's not enough. His strength is lacking, and the Heaven Gate isn't something that can't be detected."

"You're right."

At this moment, a soft laugh echoed in Marquis Huoyun's ear, "Indeed, lacking strength makes one easily detectable!"

Marquis Huoyun was startled, but then he saw Lantian smiling mischievously, "Congratulations, Brother Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu's figure appeared, initially a thousand meters away, but in the blink of an eye, he stood before them. With a faint smile, Su Yu said, "There's nothing to celebrate. The world is vast, and there are countless strong individuals. I've merely taken a small step forward."

Upon hearing this, the Great Zhou King looked at him, his expression shifting slightly, "Emperor Yu... have you stepped into the Heavenly King domain?"

The others were equally shocked.

So soon?

Wasn't he just at the peak of the Daofuse Realm?

In the blink of an eye, he's a quasi-king?

Su Yu chuckled, "Barely, but there are countless strong individuals inside. I'm nothing special. Today, I went in and gained some insights! There are several who are close to the power of laws!"

Shaking his head, he sighed, "I even saw four or five at the level of Marquis Destiny!"

He looked at Marquis Yunshui and the others, slightly puzzled, "Does our Human Race not have anyone at this level? Until Hundred Battle King appeared? If so, how did we match these people before the Ninth Tide?"

At this moment, the others were all in a daze.

General Yingwu struggled to speak, "You... you've become a quasi-king?"

Why is your advancement as simple as eating and drinking!

You weren't even in seclusion for long; you just went in and came out quickly!

Su Yu frowned slightly, "I mentioned before that I might soon reach that level! Understanding the Great Dao is about enlightenment. Once you comprehend it deeply, advancing is naturally simple!"

Simple, he says!

General Yingwu wanted to retort, but he couldn't find the words. Looking at Su Yu, his expression was already peculiar, and he exhaled, "You..."

"Don't change the subject!"

Su Yu frowned slightly, "You haven't answered my question yet!"

Before Hundred Battle King appeared, how did the Human Race match these guys?

Unless these guys never made a move.

But is that possible?

Su Yu felt that someone must have made a move!

If so, the Human Race should have had strong individuals to match them.

Everyone looked at the Great Zhou King, and Su Yu was puzzled. Why look at the Great Zhou King?

The Great Zhou King, seeing Su Yu's gaze, smiled bitterly and said, "If you're talking about the level of Marquis Destiny... the Human Race does have such individuals! Didn't we mention before that among the Torchbearers, there are two quasi-kings? One is Bingku, the other is Danyu. Bingku had the strength of this level, but... he died in the last tide."

Su Yu was surprised, "You mean Bingku was close to the realm of the power of laws, and he died? Who killed him?"

Su Yu was extremely surprised; they hadn't mentioned this before.

They only said these two had quasi-king realms.

The Great Zhou King sighed, "He died during the final breakout. At that time, there were too many besieging him. Being close to the power of laws doesn't make one the master of laws! When Hundred Battle King disappeared, those guys came out, and we needed top-tier experts to cover the retreat, otherwise... how could we escape?"

Su Yu frowned, "Foolish! So, you used Bingku's life to exchange for these six weak Daofuse Realm individuals?"

"......"

Marquis Huoyun and the others had peculiar expressions.

These six weak Daofuse Realm individuals, he must be talking about us, right?

It must be!

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, "At that time, more survived than just these. Later, they died in battle in the Upper Realm. How to put it, it wasn't a loss. After all, they fought in the Upper Realm for many years and held back the Upper Realm. Otherwise, the Upper Realm would be even more dangerous now."

He continued, "Bingku... how to say it, he was a bit reckless and impulsive. He exposed his identity during the Third Tide and was active in the Myriad Realms ever since. When Hundred Battle King rose to power, Bingku contributed a lot... After Hundred Battle King was defeated, Bingku felt ashamed and chose to cover the retreat."

The Great Zhou King sighed, "He chose to cover the retreat. I didn't say anything, didn't participate, didn't stop him. Hundred Battle King's disappearance led to the Human Race's defeat and heavy casualties. Even if Bingku had survived, I feared he would go mad. He was one of the main figures who pushed Hundred Battle King to power..."

"The three of us, Bingku was responsible for military support. Danyu was responsible for resources and logistics..."

Su Yu looked at him, "And you were responsible for planning?"

The Great Zhou King awkwardly said, "Not exactly, I was responsible for... keeping a backup plan."

Su Yu was speechless, what does keeping a backup plan mean?

Alright, it means being patient!

"So, before this, it was Bingku who resisted these top-tier quasi-kings?"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "Yes, it was him. Such individuals are rare, and they rarely make a move! Because everyone knows that if they do, it's likely to end in mutual destruction. So, Bingku's role was more about deterrence! I remember, from the Third Tide to the Ninth Tide, except for the Ninth Tide, he only made a move once... At other times, no strong individuals of this level made a move."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

He quickly said, "Alright, I understand! Individuals of this level are strategic cores and won't easily be deployed! Enough talk..."

Su Yu looked at Marquis Huoyun and the others, his eyes narrowing, "I'm preparing to kill a Heavenly King-level expert. Are you willing to join me?"

The others turned pale.

Marquis Yunshui softly said, "Human Lord... why take such a risk?"

Su Yu frowned, "Without risk, how can there be rewards? Step by step? Wait for the Upper Realm to open and capture the Lower Realm in one fell swoop? Do you know what we need to do now?"

Su Yu said solemnly, "First, weaken the enemy's strength! Second, strengthen ourselves! Third, win over enough allies! Fourth, demonstrate our strength. When our identities are exposed, the Myriad Races must hesitate, wondering if they should fight to the death?"

"The gap in strength between the two sides is still significant. Previously, I thought if the Upper Realm only had seventy or eighty Daofuse Realm individuals, we might be able to match them!"

"As it turns out, the information you provided is all from six thousand years ago!"

Su Yu was somewhat angry, "That's fine, but before this, you didn't tell me that the Myriad Races still have several individuals truly close to the power of laws. I only knew about Marquis Destiny because the Fate Clan mentioned it themselves! You... are useless!"

After speaking, he glanced at the Great Zhou King and snorted lightly, "Great Zhou King, you can't escape responsibility either! Since you knew, why didn't you say anything?"

The Great Zhou King said bitterly, "Such individuals are rare and rarely make a move... Whether they're alive or dead, I'm not sure. I didn't dare to speak rashly, fearing it would unsettle people..."

"Nonsense!"

Su Yu snorted coldly and looked at Lantian, "From now on, you will establish the Human Race's intelligence system! Relying on others is not as good as relying on ourselves. In this world, only our own people can be trusted. Everyone else... is useless!"

With one sentence, he scolded everyone except Lantian!

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly. The little trust he had built was gone again!

It wasn't that he didn't want to say it, but he really wasn't sure who among the top-tier individuals was still alive.

If they were dead, saying they were alive would only cause trouble, wouldn't it?

The Great Zhou King was helpless!

And General Yingwu and the others also had peculiar expressions, having been scolded.

This guy is truly domineering.

Marquis Yunshui looked at General Yingwu again, her eyes moving slightly. Now, do you still think Su Yu is pitiable?

General Yingwu was speechless.

He had no response.

It's not my fault. Before this, he really behaved well.

Su Yu ignored them and said sternly, "Answer my question. If the opponent is a Heavenly King, do you dare to fight?"

Su Yu spoke, his tone icy, "If you don't dare, just say so! At most, I'll have someone watch over you and prevent you from making a move! But if you abandon your post during battle, I'll prioritize killing you over dealing with the Myriad Races! Disrupting our morale will result in death!"

The faces of several people hardened. This killing intent... it was terrifying.

How many people has he killed?

This guy, who looks gentle and refined, is actually a killing machine!

At this point, General Yingwu had to speak, "If we join forces, we can kill a Heavenly King. You and Lantian are both quasi-kings..."

Su Yu said solemnly, "No, Lantian and I don't count!"

"......"

At this moment, Marquis Shadow also spoke up, "The Human Lord speaks of killing a Heavenly King. How many Heavenly Kings are we facing?"

"Seven or eight!"

"......"

The group fell silent instantly.

Even the Great Zhou King couldn't help but look at Su Yu. Are you crazy?

Lantian also bit his lollipop, crunching it with a dazed expression, looking at Su Yu. I thought I was crazy, but compared to you, I'm just a normal person!

A completely normal person!

In this world, if you, Su Yu, claim to be the second craziest, no one dares to claim first!

Su Yu said coldly, "Most likely eight, all quasi-kings. Do you dare?"

Marquis Huoyun, who had a fiery temper, suddenly smiled bitterly, "Are we going to commit suicide? Fine, if the Human Lord insists on committing suicide... then let's go! If the Human Lord isn't afraid, why should we be? I thought this generation's Human Lord seemed more refined and calm than the Hundred Battle King... turns out, he's even crazier!"

He smiled bitterly, "Then let's go crazy once!"

There's simply nothing more to say!

Killing eight Heavenly Kings!

To hell with it, let's just commit suicide. Fine, if you're not afraid of death, do you think we are?

We also want to preserve our usefulness for when the Lower Realm opens, to save it. But you people from the Lower Realm, each one is more arrogant than the last!

Marquis Yunshui also couldn't help but look at Su Yu and softly said, "The Human Lord doesn't seem like someone seeking death. So, do these eight Heavenly Kings have... any unusual characteristics?"

Su Yu looked at her and nodded slightly, "You're right, there are some peculiarities, but... still treat them as eight Heavenly Kings!"

Marquis Yunshui secretly breathed a sigh of relief. She also believed that Su Yu wasn't reckless enough to seek death.

With this approach, there was still hope.

Su Yu spoke in a deep voice, "Even if there aren't eight, we must treat it as if there are five or six!"

After finishing, Su Yu quickly added, "Gather the others. Have Marquis Dingjun and the rest all converge here. I plan to seize the opportunity to strike inside. The target is to kill six Heavenly Kings!"

Only those six mattered; the remaining two were of little concern to Su Yu.

As for whether Hundred Battle King could be unsealed... what did that have to do with him? It would be best if he emerged and fought to mutual destruction with a few top-tier experts in the Source of the Dao!

That way, it would save him a lot of trouble!
