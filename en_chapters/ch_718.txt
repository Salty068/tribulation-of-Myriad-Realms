Chapter 718: This is My Territory! (10,000-word update, please subscribe)

Though it was said there were six Daofuse cultivators, there were actually seven, as Su Yu had previously subdued Wen Qi.

Capturing Marquis Zhennan with such ease was indeed a shock for Yunshui Marquis and the others. It was too swift! Marquis Zhennan was a top-tier Daofuse cultivator, yet he didn't even stir a ripple. The myriad races had hunted human experts for years, and Marquis Zhennan had managed to hold his ground at Tiankuling for so long; capturing him shouldn't have been this easy.

At this moment, General Yingwu recalled the fear Su Yu had instilled in him before. He had almost forgotten about it. Not just him, even Marquis Huoyun frowned slightly.

The group looked at Su Yu, and Yunshui Marquis softly asked, "Has the Human Lord opened the Heaven Gate?"

Su Yu nodded.

As expected!

The group felt a slight tremor in their hearts. Shadow Marquis knew, but the others were learning for the first time that this Human Lord had actually opened the Heaven Gate. This was likely the first since ancient times.

Yunshui Marquis softly continued, "Human Lord, are you a descendant of an ancient powerhouse?"

In the past, Su Yu liked to establish connections. But now, he smiled and said, "Ancient bloodline? I'm curious, why must it be an ancient bloodline? Before the rise of the Human Emperor and others, were they of noble lineage? Were they the direct descendants of the Human Ancestor? If not of ancient bloodline, can one not be powerful?"

"Yunshui means no offense," Yunshui Marquis gently replied. "Yunshui is merely amazed by the Human Lord's talent. To open the Heaven Gate is extraordinary, and I was just curious. Please don't mind."

Su Yu laughed, "I don't mind. I just find it amusing that you all believe noble bloodlines are necessary... And what if they are? How do you even distinguish nobility?"

He continued, "In today's world, if we talk about the noblest bloodline, it might not even belong to the human race! If the River of Time has a master, that would be the most noble. And before that, perhaps the one who opened the heavens, or the master of the River of Time... Are those people necessarily human?"

Su Yu shook his head, "I don't agree with this notion of noble bloodlines!"

He looked at them, "You people think human bloodlines are the noblest, attributing the efforts of predecessors and successors to bloodlines... It's truly laughable and infuriating!"

Su Yu sighed, "After achieving some success, after countless life-and-death struggles, does it all boil down to having a noble bloodline? Such words are disheartening!"

"Countless efforts, countless life-and-death struggles, can't earn a word of hard work, can't compare to a useless bloodline... The plight of the humble... Alas!"

With a sigh, Su Yu shook his head and said as he walked, "Back when I studied at the Human Realm Academy, there was a debate between the humble and the noble! Now, I've grown so powerful, become the lord of the human race, yet I still can't escape the talk of noble bloodlines... It's somewhat disappointing and disheartening."

Beside him, the Great Zhou King softly said, "Emperor Yu need not be troubled. Nobility isn't about bloodlines; it's about the person. If Emperor Yu is noble, then naturally your bloodline is noble, superior, and a cut above the rest! If Emperor Yu has descendants..."

Su Yu calmly replied, "I understand your meaning. If I have descendants, you would support them, even if I die! Just like my teachers once said, 'Su Yu, leave behind your bloodline, and if you die, we'll fight another tide!'"

Su Yu shook his head and sighed, "No, that's not what I want! I cultivate diligently, I kill the myriad races, I battle the Myriad Realms, not to make my descendants superior! It's not about that. It's about changing one's own destiny! Being superior isn't necessary; not being looked down upon is enough! Supporting my descendants to become the Human Lord, the Human Emperor, what does that achieve?"

Su Yu was filled with endless emotion.

Because in the mouths of these elders, it often boiled down to one thing: what bloodline do you inherit? No matter how much effort you put in, they would attribute it to a superior bloodline. No one cared about how much you contributed. A single word about bloodline could erase countless efforts!

It wasn't just one or two; it was almost everyone. Even Hundred Battle King, whom he hadn't met, seemed unable to escape this, believing his own bloodline superior and the myriad races' inferior...

A single word about mixed blood made people like Marquis Dingjun certain that the Control King's lineage was worthless. It was useful, but Su Yu also saw the stubbornness and prejudice of some elders.

The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King worried about being cursed in the future. Why? Because their bloodlines had changed. No matter how great their achievements, they couldn't surpass the change in bloodline. They feared becoming objects of eternal scorn, which was also sad.

It wasn't until Su Yu promised to establish merit within the rules that they felt relieved. These were two unparalleled contributors who had protected the human race for hundreds of years! In the end, they too were troubled by the notion of mixed blood.

Several ancient powerhouses remained silent. Yunshui Marquis had only asked casually, not expecting Su Yu to react so strongly. In truth, they didn't think they were wrong. They didn't understand why Su Yu was so upset.

Bloodlines inherently had distinctions, didn't they? Human bloodlines were noble, as they should be! Deeply ingrained!

At this moment, Lantian, who hadn't left yet, chuckled, "Emperor Yu, let it go. Some things can't be forced! According to their thinking, maybe the first person to be executed after establishing the kingdom would be me."

Impure bloodline!

Lantian wasn't just impure; he was so mixed that it was unimaginable! It was impossible to even tell if he was human.

Lantian laughed, "These old stubborn ones, there's no reasoning with them. But there aren't many of them. Once they're gone, there won't be a problem!"

General Yingwu frowned, "Some things are just so. Human bloodlines are indeed superior to the myriad races! And the bloodlines of top human experts are superior to ordinary human bloodlines. That's a fact. Why is the Human Lord angry about this?"

She didn't understand. She thought there was nothing wrong with it.

She added, "If the Human Lord becomes the master of the rules and grows powerful, your descendants will also have superior bloodlines, a cut above the rest. No one will deny it. It's not discrimination; it's a fact. Why can't it be said?"

She retorted.

The Great Zhou King glanced at her, thinking she was bold. Perhaps she wasn't familiar with Su Yu. If she were, no one would dare to retort at this moment.

Of course, Su Yu gradually calmed down and shook his head, "Forget it. Maybe you're right. Some things are hard to argue about. But if I become the emperor and redefine the rules of the Myriad Realms, I will add one rule... Do not judge heroes by bloodline!"

Su Yu calmly said, "You don't understand, nor do you realize! Some who aren't of pure human bloodline have sacrificed so much for the human race! Your insistence on the supremacy of the human race is laughable to me! Without me, without them, it's hard to say if there would be a human race today!"

"Whether it's the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, Lantian, or me, we... are not of pure human bloodline!"

This statement shocked everyone.

What did he mean?

Others aside, but you... what's your situation?

The Great Zhou King hadn't thought of it at first, but soon realized something, his eyes showing a strange light.

Yes, Su Yu... seemed not to be of pure human bloodline!

Half-dead spirit bloodline!

No wonder Su Yu was so angry!

Because a single statement about the supremacy of human bloodlines might even lead to questioning and denying Su Yu himself. Everything he and the Great Qin King had done might ultimately be dismissed as nothing due to a single word about bloodline!

Marquis Huoyun couldn't help but ask in a deep voice, "What does the Human Lord mean?"

Su Yu calmly replied, "Nothing much. I have a dead spirit bloodline, half-dead spirit! Not purely human! Not only that, but I also have many dead spirit experts under my command, and they aren't considered human either! I've always believed that if one's heart is with the human race, then they are human! Today, after debating with you all, I realize I might have been wrong!"

The expressions of several people changed unpredictably.

Half-dead spirit!

This was the first half-dead spirit Human Lord, unprecedented.

At this moment, Lantian was already itching to act, transmitting to Su Yu, "Emperor Yu, if any of these people show any signs of disobedience... just kill them! These old fools have no idea what you've done for the human race!"

Lantian thought these guys were detestable!

Without Su Yu, would there still be a human race in the lower realm?

That's hard to say!

The Great Zhou King's idea of waiting for decades, could they really wait that long?

Given the current situation in the upper realm, even if Hundred Battle King emerged, he would probably be doomed!

In the end, the Control King's lineage might become the dominant force, and they... well, they weren't pure human blood either. That would be interesting.

Lantian suddenly transmitted with a laugh, "Emperor Yu, according to their thinking, maybe we and the Control King's lineage shouldn't exist."

Su Yu didn't respond.

At this moment, he didn't want to say anything.

As for these ancient relics around him, they could accept it or not. If they didn't oppose him, Su Yu wouldn't care. But if anyone dared to oppose him, he would kill them!

He hadn't paid much attention to his half-dead spirit status before, but today he realized it still mattered.

The current human race might not care, but many people certainly still did.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was also silent.

The group followed Su Yu swiftly forward.

Yunshui Marquis and the others were also deep in thought.

Su Yu wasn't of pure human blood!

Even General Yingwu, who opposed Hundred Battle King, was digesting this fact: Su Yu wasn't purely human; he was half-dead spirit. Could he still be the Human Lord?

No one knew how long it took before General Yingwu spoke, "How did you become half-dead spirit?"

"In a good mood, so I became half-dead spirit."

"......"

Yingwu was speechless, feeling a bit frustrated, and asked, "Can't you sever the dead spirit channel now?"

"I won't sever it!"

Su Yu calmly replied, "Being half-dead spirit suits my mood better."

"But..."

Yingwu felt awkward and said, "But don't you think this will make people oppose you?"

"It won't."

At this moment, Su Yu had come to terms with it and laughed, "How could it? Ask the Great Zhou King, are there any among the hundreds of billions in the lower realm who oppose me?"

"None!"

The Great Zhou King also replied calmly.

Yingwu asked in confusion, "Do they know you're half-dead spirit?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu laughed.

The Great Zhou King chuckled lightly, "Of course I know. How could I not? Emperor Yu's rise didn't start with the Human Race, but with the Thirty-Six Ancient Cities! He began by subduing them, and only then did he return to the Human Race to unify the Myriad Realms!"

The group was taken aback. "He... the Human Lord didn't rise from the Human Race? He wasn't supported by the elders to become the Human Lord?"

"Why would he need support?" Su Yu laughed. "Isn't it more satisfying to seize it yourself? When I ascended, no one dared to oppose me, nor could they! Including the Great Zhou King, who, even if he initially thought of me as a puppet, now has to listen, doesn't he?"

The Great Zhou King agreed, "Naturally, Emperor Yu's abilities far surpass others. Apart from Emperor Yu, not a single soul among the billions can compare!"

"..."

How nauseating!

The ancient marquises were speechless. This Human Emperor's subordinate was utterly shameless!

General Yingwu frowned, "Then... you say no one dares oppose you. Does that mean the three quasi-kings all heed your command?"

"Of course!" Su Yu smiled. "Why wouldn't they? Lantian is a quasi-king. Does Lantian listen to me?"

"Naturally!" Lantian grinned, "I follow Emperor Yu in all things! Any disobedience will be met with death!"

As he spoke, Lantian glanced at Yingwu, smiling, "Why do you have such thoughts? Why would you think anyone dares disobey? The three quasi-kings... are you referring to me, the Culture King's dog, and the South King? We all naturally follow Emperor Yu!"

Yingwu looked helpless, tinged with a bit of sorrow.

Weren't you supposed to be in a dire situation?

Weren't your subordinates supposed to not listen to you?

Weren't the Hundred Battle forces supposed to be formidable?

Yingwu was resigned, while Marquis Yunshui caught onto something else, softly asking, "The Culture King's dog?"

"Yes." Su Yu nodded slightly, "Fat Ball, do you know it?"

"Not well," Yunshui replied softly, "but I've heard of it. So, it has also stepped into the quasi-king realm."

Yunshui didn't bring up the bloodline matter again, gently asking, "Then, aside from the quasi-kings, are there any top-tier Daofuse experts among the Human Race?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course, isn't the Great Zhou King one?"

"And there's Director Wan, whose strength is comparable to the Great Zhou King."

"Additionally, the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King are about the same as you, Marquis Yunshui."

Yunshui and the others listened quietly, taking this opportunity to understand the strength of the Human Race in the lower realm.

Marquis Huoyun raised an eyebrow, "So, the top-tier strength of the Human Race in the lower realm isn't that much?"

Su Yu chuckled, "It's alright! I also have some non-human subordinates, including General Hongmeng, who is close to being a quasi-king, Marquis Lanshan from the Death Realm, and Doubao from the God-Eating Race..."

After mentioning a few, Su Yu laughed, "Overall, the strength is decent. Of course, it can't compare to the Upper Realm. The Upper Realm has many strong experts. There's hope in fighting one of the three major races, but fighting all three would be courting death!"

The group continued to digest the information Su Yu revealed.

After a while, Shadow Marquis suddenly changed his expression, "Human Lord, where are we heading now?"

"The Land of Dao Source!"

"No!" Shadow Marquis's face changed, "That place is too dangerous! A batch of top-tier experts from the myriad races are there. If we enter the Land of Dao Source and are discovered, it would be a path to death!"

General Yingwu was also surprised, "Going there? To unseal Hundred Battle? Didn't you say you don't listen to Hundred Battle?"

Why go there?

Su Yu laughed, "Just to probe. Why panic?"

Can we not panic?

Marquis Huoyun was a bit anxious, "There are more than one or two quasi-kings there, even more than ten! Going there, even if we have quasi-kings, if surrounded, we will surely die!"

"I know."

"Then why go..."

"Just follow me!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Stop asking endless questions. I've opened the Heaven Gate and see more than you!"

These guys, so much nonsense.

If it were Wan Tiansheng and the others, they wouldn't ask anything.

They'd just go!

Only then did the group remember that Su Yu had opened the Heaven Gate. Even so, they were still worried.

Marquis Yunshui looked at General Yingwu again, his eyes speaking volumes, filled with helplessness.

Weren't you supposed to listen to everyone's advice?

And General Yingwu, also responding with his eyes, really, he seemed very receptive to advice before. Look, I asked him to find you and subdue you, and he didn't even argue!

The two exchanged glances, both filled with some helplessness.

It was rash!

Joining this camp early on, with the current situation, leaving... isn't easy.

Marquis Zhennan was directly suppressed!

This one clearly wasn't just about subduing them but also about clearing obstacles to prevent sabotage.

...

Su Yu wouldn't bother with them.

Since they were by his side now, they shouldn't think about causing trouble!

Even if their strength wasn't weak, Su Yu, Lantian, and the Great Zhou King together might not completely suppress them, but this was the Upper Realm, and the myriad races were watching them.

Su Yu could escape; they couldn't!

If Su Yu didn't take them, their whereabouts would be exposed, and they'd surely die!

Su Yu could leave; he could return to the lower realm.

At this moment, Su Yu just wanted things to be perfect, but it didn't mean they couldn't be imperfect. If pushed, Su Yu could kill a few and run, leaving these guys to take the fall. What could they do?

Including framing the Control King's lineage, killing three Daofuse experts...

Su Yu could make mistakes!

He could give up at any time, not pursue perfection. What's the big deal?

At worst, I'll return to the lower realm.

It's that simple!

The lower realm will open, but not now. There are still a few years. The Fate Clan's passage, these people can't go down. If they do, it's seeking death.

...

The Land of Dao Source, located in the extreme east of the Upper Realm.

Vast and mysterious.

On this land, you might encounter unclaimed rule daos at any time, complete ones. If you merge with one, you might become a top-tier Daofuse expert, provided your compatibility with the dao is high.

Becoming a quasi-king isn't impossible either.

However, becoming a master of rules is as hard as ascending to the heavens. Even though there are many rule daos, even complete ones, no one can fully master them now.

This land is shrouded in white light.

Here, is the origin of the dao, the starting point of the dao.

Thus, after ancient times, it was named the Land of Dao Source.

In fact, before this, in ancient times, this place was called Tianhekou.

Of course, after ancient times, many thought the name didn't sound good. Tianhekou, where's the Tianhe?

Is this the mouth of the Tianhe?

But there's no Tianhe to be seen!

Since the Human Race's defeat six thousand years ago, this place has become the territory of the myriad races. A large number of strong experts from the myriad races have poured in, capturing dao rules, competing for the power of dao laws, and comprehending the dao here.

In these six thousand years, many strong experts from the myriad races have been born.

Before this, the Human Race also produced many strong experts. Otherwise, there wouldn't have been over a hundred Daofuse experts to consume.

The Land of Dao Source also has many mysterious places.

For example, the Gate to the Lower Realm, the Sealed Mountain, which is said to seal the Hundred Battle King.

And many other places that might hide or house some ancient beings.

Some truly close to the realm of rule masters!

They have reached the true peak of Daofuse, and one step further would be mastering the rule dao. Unfortunately, there's no path forward.

Here, some of these peerless experts also slumber.

They might be from the myriad races, or... there might still be some from the Human Race.

After all, the Human Race ruled this place for countless years. However, these people might have completely fallen into slumber, never to appear again, because at that level, they are all striving to take that step forward.

...

A massive light curtain covered a piece of heaven and earth.

In stark contrast to the darkness of Chaos Mountain, the Land of Dao Source is perpetually bright.

One east, one west, forming the two most dangerous regions in the Upper Realm.

At this moment, outside the massive light curtain.

Shadow Marquis, as the expert with the most intelligence, transmitted, "The Land of Dao Source is perpetually shrouded by these light curtains, which are actually composed of the power of laws!"

"So if someone enters or exits, it causes quite a commotion. Now, the Human Race doesn't dare to step in. If a strong expert comes to investigate and discovers it's the Human Race... they will surely pursue and kill!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Shadow Marquis continued, "Each race has strong experts within, and there's even a rumor that our Human Race has strong experts slumbering inside!"

Seeing Su Yu looking at him, Shadow Marquis explained, "It's just a rumor. I don't know if it's true. Because it's said that those who have truly reached the peak are only a step away from mastering the rule dao, but they can't take that step. Their strength is too great, consuming too much. Some even have the comprehension of a true rule master... with no other choice, they can only slumber, no longer comprehending the dao!"

Su Yu was puzzled, "Slumber, no longer comprehend the power of the dao?"

Shadow Marquis found it hard to explain, but the Great Zhou King softly said, "It's actually quite simple. For example, if my power of the dao has reached its peak, and I can clearly master this dao, but I can't, yet I keep absorbing the power of laws... the absorption rate is fast, but I can't digest it, then I'll burst myself!"

Su Yu was stunned for a moment, looking at the Great Zhou King, "How do you know?"

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, transmitting, "I've reached the peak of the Endurance Dao, of course, I know."

Su Yu realized, right, that seems to be the case.

Su Yu frowned, "You're saying that because they've comprehended the dao beyond their current strength, their absorption rate is too fast, so they can only choose to slumber to slow down the absorption rate."

"Yes!" The Great Zhou King nodded, "There's no other way! Unless they leave this place, the power of laws here is too dense, but leaving..."

The Great Zhou King chuckled bitterly, "The power of these guys' Great Daos is too strong, and there's no suitable middle ground to maintain it! Either they burst from over-absorption or starve from lack of it! So, they choose to slumber here, sealing themselves to slow down the absorption rate. This way, they neither burst nor starve."

Only those of the same realm could understand such a predicament.

Su Yu looked at him in confusion. The Great Zhou King explained again, "My Great Dao isn't that strong, so it's not much of a problem. Moreover, in the Myriad Realms, the River of Time suppresses it, so it's not a big issue! Only in the Upper Realm is the suppression weak, making the Great Dao power too loose and prone to accidents!"

"The Lower Realm has its advantages. These guys, if they go to the Lower Realm, can also be suppressed. But if they stay in the Upper Realm for too long, they might be repelled back up unless the power of laws dissipates!"

The Great Zhou King continued, "They are repelled because their Great Dao is too loose. Once the power of laws in the Lower Realm spreads again, they can't sustain it and have to go back up, or they'll be crushed!"

Su Yu roughly understood and thought for a moment before saying, "It's not a big problem now, right? The power of laws in the Lower Realm has dissipated quite a bit."

The Great Zhou King nodded, "It should be fine now. When the power of laws spreads in the Lower Realm again, those who came down from the Upper Realm must leave. It's mainly due to the repulsion caused by the Great Dao power, just like how the dead are repelled in the Realm of Living Beings."

Su Yu nodded and didn't ask further. His eyes revealed the Heaven Gate as he looked towards the light screen.

Upon seeing it, Su Yu's eyes trembled slightly. He saw it!

In the depths of the light screen, he saw the River of Time... No, it wasn't. It seemed... not like the River of Time?

Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate to the extreme, continuously observing. He looked far and deep.

In the sky, there seemed to be a broken river, only a small part, or rather, just a beginning without an end.

Su Yu licked his lips.

"The River of Time... No, it's not. It doesn't quite resemble it. It's more like... a tributary... No, it's more like the Death Path... Yes, a bit of the Death Path has been opened!"

At this moment, Su Yu seemed to comprehend what this was.

That crescent-like thing hanging in the sky should be the path opened by the Human Emperor... it should be!

But the Human Emperor might have encountered an issue after opening just a bit.

The Human Emperor had no choice but to abandon it.

"Is that so?"

Su Yu murmured to himself, is that so?

This path, strictly speaking, is similar to a tributary, actually a Great Dao extending from the River of Time, but the difference lies in its vastness!

Moreover, it wasn't completed.

Did the Human Emperor abandon it?

Or did he not abandon it and still retain ownership of this Great Dao?

Su Yu's Heaven Gate was open, continuously consuming his power. He didn't mind and continued to observe.

The benefit of opening the Heaven Gate lies in this.

What the Myriad Realms couldn't understand for countless years, Su Yu could see!

"So, strictly speaking, this counts as a tributary, but it carries different attribute powers!"

"The River of Time is the fusion of myriad paths. The Death Path is a standalone path of death. What attribute does the path opened by the Human Emperor carry?"

"Moreover, was it the Human Emperor who opened it, or was it the Culture King?"

The Culture King also abandoned some Great Daos, like the pen dao.

So, in the Upper Realm, was it the Culture King who opened it, or the Human Emperor?

This, Su Yu wasn't clear about for now.

"If I enter from here, can I enter the true River of Time? I should be able to. There must be a junction point. Otherwise, a half-opened path couldn't continuously spill out the power of laws!"

"Then what about the unclaimed power of laws here?"

In the River of Time, Su Yu hadn't seen unclaimed power of laws... Well, there are countless tributaries, but you can't enter them. Even if you do, you can't suddenly grasp the power of laws!

So, what's the situation with the power of laws here?

One question after another arose in Su Yu's mind.

"Can I tear open the River of Time here and enter it?"

"And, weren't the Hundred Battle King and others fighting in the Lower Realm back then? Why were they sealed here? Where exactly was the Hundred Battle King sealed? They couldn't have been half-dead in the Lower Realm and dragged here to be sealed, right?"

That would be better than killing them outright!

At this moment, Su Yu was extremely interested in this place. He had seen through a bit of Chaos Mountain, but he hadn't reached that level yet, so he didn't continue exploring.

This place, however, intrigued Su Yu greatly!

Because this is the beginning of a path!

Opening a unique Great Dao, opening the path of the heavens!

"Fascinating..."

Su Yu murmured, and General Yingwu and the others looked at him, each with a peculiar expression. Fascinating?

They only felt it was extremely dangerous!

Suddenly, Su Yu tore the void with his bare hands, then frowned slightly, "No, outside the light screen, it seems impossible to open the River of Time."

Shadow Marquis nodded, "It's not possible outside. You can do it inside! The light screen blocks it..."

Su Yu shook his head, "No, it's not blocked. It's just... the coverage area is only that big! Just as big as the Source of the Dao."

Is there a difference?

Shadow Marquis thought to himself.

Of course, Su Yu felt there was a difference. It wasn't that the light screen was strong enough to block it, but that the Human Emperor's river was only that long, not the true River of Time that could cover the heavens!

"Only by going inside can you open the River of Time, and going inside will trigger the light screen. The light screen is composed of the power of laws that have spilled out..."

"Is it the Human Emperor or the Culture King?"

Su Yu fell into contemplation.

He suddenly looked at the Great Zhou King, "Was the Upper Realm still being developed at the end of the ancient times?"

"It was!"

The Great Zhou King nodded.

"Did the Human Emperor leave the Luminous Domain Mansion?"

"No, the Human Emperor was always in the Luminous Domain Mansion."

Su Yu frowned, "What about the Culture King?"

"The Culture King was already missing by the end."

Su Yu inhaled sharply, that doesn't make sense.

The Human Emperor didn't leave, and the Culture King was missing, so how was the Great Dao being opened?

Could it be that without leaving the Myriad Realms, the Great Dao could still be opened here?

Then the Human Emperor was ridiculously strong!

No!

Suddenly, Su Yu's eyes flickered as he looked at the Great Zhou King, "Let me ask you, at the end of the ancient times, was there a fluctuation of time rules on the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion?"

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly, "The rule fluctuation you're talking about... what kind of fluctuation?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Let me put it another way, could you open the River of Time on the ninth floor?"

"No!"

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "There's no River of Time on the ninth floor."

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and thoughts arose one after another.

The Human Emperor never left, but the Great Dao was still being opened here... Was the Human Emperor opening it on the ninth floor?

The ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion might be connected to the Upper Realm!

"The negative first floor connects to the Death Realm, and the ninth floor connects to the Upper Realm. That seems normal!"

"Then this place was definitely opened by the Human Emperor, and the connection point with the River of Time... is on the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

At this moment, Su Yu instantly connected all the clues!

His heart trembled slightly, the Luminous Domain Mansion!

This place, what a place!

It connects to the Death Realm below and the Upper Realm above.

It's a huge transit station!

The Human Emperor sat within, unifying the three realms!

"What boldness!"

Su Yu's heart trembled slightly. In the ancient era, the Human Emperor's boldness was truly remarkable, extending his influence across the three realms!

The Upper Realm, the Myriad Realms, the Death Realm.

He sat on the ninth floor, capable of suppressing everything.

What a pity!

What a pity!

If the Human Emperor had completed the opening of the Upper Realm's Great Dao, who could rival him?

A true sovereign!

Although these were just Su Yu's speculations, he felt they were probably correct. Otherwise, the Human Emperor couldn't have been running around everywhere, opening paths everywhere.

Only by opening a portal to the River of Time in his own Human Emperor's Palace, entering the River of Time, entering the Upper Realm, and stealing power along the path he opened could he open the Upper Realm's path!

"Impressive!"

Su Yu praised, and the others just watched him.

They had no idea what Su Yu was thinking or seeing.

They couldn't understand even if they looked!

General Yingwu transmitted, "What exactly did the Human Lord see?"

Su Yu smiled, "I saw the ambition of the ancient Human Emperor, saw the strength of the ancient Human Emperor, saw his grand plans! What a pity, what a pity! The Culture King was unreliable. If he hadn't left... if the Human Emperor had succeeded, what a pity!"

Su Yu shook his head.

Marquis Yunshui frowned slightly, "The Culture King also had grand plans..."

"You don't understand!"

Su Yu shook his head, you really don't understand!

These people only saw the strength of the Culture King, not the grand plans of the Human Emperor!

This was a true sovereign!

Opening the Upper Realm, opening a path, opening a day, transforming the Upper Realm into his own heaven, breaking free from the control of the River of Time, becoming a true hegemon, with the Human Realm standing independently, from then on, the Human Race in the Upper Realm could suppress the ages!

If the Culture King and Martial King hadn't left, if they had stayed a few more years, if they had given the Human Emperor a few more years, he could have completed his plan!

Marquis Yunshui and the others were all extremely peculiar.

We don't understand?

Well, maybe we really don't.

And the Great Zhou King, at this moment, also sighed, "His Majesty the Human Emperor was indeed a sovereign."

He didn't know what else to say.

A sovereign, missing for a hundred thousand years!

"I've always dealt more with the Culture King. Today, I want to see the path of the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu said excitedly, "I also want to see what makes this emperor, who could suppress the Culture King and become the Human Lord, so remarkable!"

Seeing him about to leave, the Great Zhou King hurriedly said, "The light screen will fluctuate..."

"Nonsense!"

Su Yu sneered, suddenly taking out a small stone, "With this, no problem! If his own seal can't suppress the power of laws spilling from his own Great Dao, then he might as well not live!"

This, Su Yu deduced, was the Human Emperor's seal, an early version.

His own seal would surely suppress the power of laws spilling out.

Year 735 of the New Yu Calendar.

In the midst of a tense atmosphere, the Great Zhou King voiced his concern, "What if something goes wrong?"

"I'll go alone first. What could possibly go wrong? If things get dicey, I'll just force my way in and quickly dive into the River of Time... Don't worry, no one understands the River of Time better than I do!" Su Yu's confidence was palpable.

"Don't follow me. If you do, you'll just be a burden, and your presence will easily expose me!" he added, his tone dismissive.

A group of powerful figures stood around, their expressions a mix of discomfort and disbelief at his words.

Su Yu chuckled, "I'll scout ahead and come back for you later!"

With that, he vanished from sight.

In the ears of the Great Zhou King and Lantian, Su Yu's voice echoed, "Keep a close watch on those guys. If they make any suspicious moves, attack immediately, then retreat to Soul Burying Mountain and wait for me!"

His words were ruthless.

The Great Zhou King remained impassive. Su Yu was as ruthless and cautious as ever, not considering these people as allies. However, it seemed that he considered the Great Zhou King one of his own.

The Great Zhou King felt a pang of bitterness. It was tough being him. Fortunately, with these people from the Upper Realm around, he could finally shake off the label of being a remnant of the Hundred Battle lineage. The folks from the Upper Realm were more fitting for that title.

He glanced at the ancient marquises, silently cursing them. You better not make any moves. If you do, Lantian will surely trap you.

Meanwhile, Su Yu had already approached the light curtain. A small stone appeared, gently slipping into the curtain. As expected, when the stone entered, it did so silently, without disturbing the power of laws within the curtain. Su Yu was ecstatic!

This not only meant he could enter quietly, but also suggested that here, he might be able to suppress the power of laws of the myriad races' experts!

"This place belongs to the Human Emperor!"

"And the Human Emperor's domain is my domain!"

Su Yu's heart was filled with joy. Damn, this place is mine, do you know that?

My home turf!

Even though it was his first time here, it didn't change the fact that this place belonged to him!
