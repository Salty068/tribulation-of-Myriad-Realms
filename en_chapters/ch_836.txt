Chapter 836: Strong Forces, Set Out! (Please Subscribe)

Three months had passed.

For Su Yu and his faction, this was the longest period of seclusion for cultivation. In the past, three months might have seemed insignificant, but under Su Yu's leadership, it felt as if three months were equivalent to three hundred years.

If one couldn't break through in three months, it was as if they hadn't made progress in three hundred years—a serious issue indeed!

Today marked the second year of the New Yu Calendar.

With a resounding voice echoing through the air, everyone knew the moment to decide their fate had arrived.

"The three-month period has ended. Everyone, come see me immediately!"

Boom!

In the dim world, the ground cracked open in various places, and powerful beings swiftly flew towards the direction of the Human Lord Seal.

The time had come!

Those who had broken through were filled with joy, while those who hadn't were dejected, some even despairing.

It was too despairing!

However, those who had already broken through felt no pressure. They had already succeeded and didn't need to worry.

...

Within the Human Lord Seal.

One by one, the strong gathered quickly.

Even the South Heavenly King and others arrived promptly. From the rear, faint laughter could be heard. These past few months had been a period of great harvest for everyone.

Those on the list were tense, while those not on it were more relaxed.

Moments later, whether they had broken through or not, everyone had arrived.

There were many strong individuals!

Su Yu's figure gradually appeared.

As soon as he appeared, everyone bowed, "Greetings, Your Majesty!"

"Rise!"

Su Yu stood with his hands behind his back, surveying the surroundings, feeling somewhat satisfied. Most of those he had named on the list had broken through. Over the past few months, Su Yu's world had advanced several times.

If they still couldn't break through, it meant these individuals would find it hard to catch up!

The further one progressed, the harder it became to grasp the power of laws. As Su Yu continued to perfect his world, the paths grew stronger. The stronger the path, the more difficult it became to master in the later stages.

Now, those who had grasped a path were adding insights to their already mastered paths, which was different from those who hadn't mastered one yet.

Su Yu looked at them and nodded slightly, "Previously, I listed 30 names. Additionally, the Martial Emperor, South Heavenly King, Great Zhou King, Giant Axe, Red Moon, Blood Shadow, Hongmeng, Destiny, Death Spirit King, Consort Qi, Eight-Winged Tiger, and Chaos Dragon—12 powerful beings—have reached the realm of the Ruler of Laws!"

Before this, Su Yu's faction already had these 12 top-tier experts. Including himself, there were 13 top-tier experts.

Su Yu continued, "And most of the 30 have broken through!"

He paused, his expression turning cold, "However, there are still a few who, after three months, have yet to break through!"

Below, some faces were filled with dejection!

Su Yu suddenly looked at a few individuals, "Great Xia King!"

In the crowd, the Great Xia King stepped forward with a despondent expression, head lowered, "Your Majesty!"

Su Yu's gaze was complex, "Great Xia King, I hail from the Great Xia Prefecture. You were one of the earliest top-tier experts to support me! You were also one of the first human experts to stand up for me. Likewise, you and the Great Qin King were among the first to integrate into my world! You wield the Dao of the Blade, a conventional yet immensely powerful path. To help you advance, I spared no effort..."

The crowd's expressions shifted, and Su Yu sighed, "However, I keep my word! The three-month period has ended, and you have not advanced... In that case, Great Xia King, relinquish the Blade Dao and let someone with more potential cultivate it!"

Upon hearing this, the Great Xia King was utterly dejected, saying nothing.

Below, the Great Qin King's expression changed. He stepped forward, "Your Majesty, the Great Xia King is close. Give him a little more time, and he will soon break through..."

Su Yu replied coldly, "Great Qin King! This is a military order! Do you change orders in the military? Precisely because the Great Xia King was one of the earliest to support me and occupied the Blade Dao, no one said anything! But he has been unable to break through for too long. You know the resources he has consumed! The corpse of the Desolate Beast, the Dao, including several path changes, and he was the first to integrate into my world... One could say he has received more than anyone else!"

"Since he cannot break through now and cannot become a strong support for the upper reaches, he must relinquish the Dao!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "I see that Xia Longwu is about to break through, but he does not cultivate the Blade Dao. If the path is relinquished now, perhaps... there will soon be another Ruler of Laws among us!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Xia King and said solemnly, "Great Xia King, if you voluntarily relinquish the path now and leave your insights on the Blade Dao, I will pass this path to your grandson, Xia Longwu. Since you cannot keep up... I believe your grandson will do better!"

In the crowd, Xia Longwu's expression changed slightly.

Su Yu suddenly looked at Xia Longwu, coldly saying, "Do not refuse. If your grandfather cannot fight, will you also avoid battle?"

Xia Longwu's expression changed, and he lowered his head, "No, Xia Longwu is willing to fight!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, looking at the Great Xia King, and said solemnly, "Great Xia King... what do you think?"

The Great Xia King was filled with despondency, sighed, and nodded, "I ask Your Majesty to help me sever the Dao..."

He turned to look at the Great Qin King, forcing a bitter smile, "Qin Spear, Xia Blade... Xia Blade... has passed to Longwu. Old Qin, Qin Spear... you must carry on!"

The once-feared Qin Spear and Xia Blade, now, the Xia Blade had withdrawn from the front lines.

Upon hearing this, the Great Qin King's eyes reddened.

The Great Xia King had been his brother in arms, fighting alongside him until now. It wasn't death, but it was more painful than death. From a frontline warrior, he was retreating to the second line, beginning his retirement... How cruel it was for the Great Xia King!

The Great Qin King gritted his teeth and said loudly, "Your Majesty! If Old Xia changes his path and also becomes a Ruler of Laws, can he continue to fight?"

Su Yu replied indifferently, "I would welcome it! But changing paths to one he is not proficient in... Now that the world is more complete than before, if he can't break through now, it will be even harder in the future! Well, there must be some hope... If the Great Xia King is unwilling to give up, he can find a way to break through... If we haven't returned to the Myriad Realms yet, those who break through to the Ruler of Laws can also actively reverse the flow and come find us..."

The Great Qin King immediately looked at the Great Xia King, speaking solemnly, "Old Xia, don't give up! The Blade Dao is not the only path. Walk another path, and you can still break through. I'll be waiting for you at the front!"

For a moment, the atmosphere was somber.

Everyone felt a pang of sorrow. The Great Xia King had been one of the earliest top-tier experts to support Su Yu, and now, he was actually not far from becoming a Ruler of Laws. Perhaps he could break through soon.

But Su Yu... he chose the Great Xia King as the first to make an example!

With this, those who hadn't broken through were already in despair.

Forget it!

There was no hope!

Su Yu would show no mercy!

If even the Great Xia King faced this outcome, what about them?

Su Yu said indifferently, "Alright, there will be opportunities in the future. It depends on whether you are willing to fight for them! Great Xia King, do not resist. I will sever your Blade Dao. Xia Longwu... since your grandfather cannot succeed, I hope that with the Blade Dao in your hands, you can carry it forward. If you also fail to break through... then the Blade Dao, this conventional path, will eventually have to be relinquished!"

Xia Longwu stepped forward, his expression cold, "The Blade Dao has passed from my grandfather to me. It was initially integrated by my Xia family, and this path... will not be lost from the Xia family!"

With that, he let out a low shout, and his own Dao suddenly broke, his face pale, yet blade energy surged around him. He said in a low voice, "I ask Your Majesty to continue the path for me!"

He was also a fierce person. Before the Great Xia King had relinquished the path, he had already severed his own!

Beside him, the Great Xia King suddenly cursed, "I haven't relinquished it yet, and you're already impatient? You've been waiting for this, haven't you?"

"......"

Everyone was speechless!

At this point, the father and son should stop bickering!

Xia Longwu remained silent.

The Great Xia King was also helpless, reluctantly, he sighed, and finally, he severed his own Dao in an instant. Blade energy instantly dissipated, and in the blink of an eye, the Great Xia King seemed to age significantly, appearing much more desolate.

His face was pale, his aura declined, and he wore a bitter expression.

Su Yu, with a cold expression, inwardly cursed, "You're really putting on a show!"

This was suggested by your great-grandson, and your son also suggested it. Don't you have any idea?

What are you pretending for?

Alright, pretending is good too!

According to Lord Xiahou and the others, the competition between the Great Xia King and Xia Longwu was too intense. Both were on the Blade Dao, but Xia Longwu actually had more potential than the Great Xia King. After all, Xia Longwu was the most outstanding talent of Su Yu's era!

In Xia Longwu's generation, there was almost no one who could compete with him. Xia Longwu, in terms of seniority, was a student of Wan Tiansheng, of the same generation as Liu Wenyan and the others. But now, Liu Wenyan, Hong Tan, and these people had all disappeared.

Everyone knew that Su Yu had probably taken them away.

In this way, Xia Longwu was the most outstanding person of Su Yu's previous generation, without exception!

Others, like Qin Zhen from the Qin family, Liu Wushen from the Liu family, Zhou Polong from the Zhou family...

These people were not as outstanding as Xia Longwu.

Therefore, the Great Xia King giving way to Xia Longwu was actually a good thing. It also served as a deterrent to everyone, and it allowed the Great Xia King to naturally withdraw from the front lines and join the Dark Guard. The Dark Guard still lacked a veteran strong enough to suppress everyone.

The Great Xia King had enough prestige to suppress everyone, including Nan Wujiang, Yun Chen, Liu Hong, Zhu Tiandao... These people, whether they came from the Great Xia Prefecture or grew up hearing stories of the Great Xia King.

With the Great Xia King present, even Liu Hong wouldn't dare to act recklessly.

At this moment, the Great Xia King, who had relinquished the path, looked weak and full of sorrow, making the Great Qin King almost want to cry. My old brother... after today, it's as if he's dead!

An old soldier not on the battlefield, is he still a soldier?

The Great Xia King, after today, is as good as dead!

The Great Qin King was filled with sorrow!

He comforted himself, perhaps it's a good thing. Old Xia might still have a peaceful old age, which is also a good thing.

The Great Qin King was quite dramatic!

Su Yu didn't mind much. The Great Qin King was unaware that his two sons had actually joined the Dark Guards. This was because Su Yu had warned Qin Zhen and Qin Hao not to tell the Great Qin King, advising them to keep their mouths shut. Otherwise, if something happened to the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King showed no reaction, it would be quite inappropriate!

Now... things were just fine!

Look at the Great Ming King; his acting skills are far superior. Zhu Tiandao and Zhu Tianfang, along with Zhu Tiandao's son Zhu Guangshen, had all joined, and the Great Ming King couldn't possibly be unaware of this. Yet, the Great Ming King played his role perfectly, wearing a face of sorrow while enduring the pain...

Here, it was all about who could act better!

Su Yu didn't say much more. With a swift motion, he grabbed a path filled with the aura of a blade and quickly integrated it into Xia Longwu's body. In an instant, Xia Longwu's aura surged, and his comprehension of the path rapidly expanded, covering the entire Blade Dao in the blink of an eye. The sharp blade aura swept across the heavens and earth!

Under the stunned gaze of the Great Xia King, Xia Longwu roared, and the path transformed into a long blade, slashing towards the sky!

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed, shaking the sky!

Xia Longwu's aura soared to its peak in an instant, and with a rumble, the rules of the path trembled. A path was directly absorbed into Xia Longwu's sea of will, leaving the Great Xia King and the others dumbfounded.

The Great Xia King was in a daze!

At this moment, he couldn't keep up the act any longer.

Damn it!

Am I... am I really inferior to my grandson?

I don't believe it!

Although he had been pretending these days, in reality, comprehending the Blade Dao was still challenging, and he increasingly felt that it became more difficult the further he progressed. If he truly put in the effort, he still had some hope of entering the realm of the ruler of laws.

But the Great Xia King couldn't guarantee it with absolute certainty.

Yet now, his grandson had effortlessly stepped into the realm of the ruler of laws, leaving the Great Xia King in genuine pain!

How tragic!

As a powerful figure, the most tragic thing is to be surpassed by your descendants while you're still in your prime.

If he were old and frail, he could sigh and say that the younger generation surpasses the old, which would be a good thing!

But... I'm not old yet!

I'm just over five hundred years old!

In any era, at this level, that's not considered old.

But now, my grandson has surpassed me!

In an instant, the Great Xia King felt disheartened, filled with sorrow. I can't believe I'm inferior to my grandson. My title as the world's number one blade... is a disgrace!

The key is, it seems, I was occupying my grandson's path, preventing him from advancing. Otherwise, he would have advanced long ago?

...

At this moment, Su Yu was also surprised.

He knew Xia Longwu had great talent, strong abilities, and a powerful Blade Dao, but... directly continuing the path to mastery was beyond Su Yu's expectations.

The next moment, Su Yu smiled, "Not bad, very good!"

Very good!

He praised him.

At this moment, beside Xia Longwu stood Marquis Dingjun, who also felt a bit sorrowful. He glanced at the Great Qin King, wondering why the Great Qin King had broken through.

The Great Qin King followed the Gun Dao, just like him...

If the Great Qin King hadn't broken through, would His Majesty have given me a path too, allowing me to become a ruler of laws in an instant?

He glanced at the Great Qin King a few times, but the Great Qin King looked back with an unfriendly gaze!

Why are you looking at me?

I broke through!

Su Yu was no longer so cold. He smiled, praised Xia Longwu, and said with a laugh, "Great Xia King, just enjoy your retirement! Xia Longwu has lived up to the name of the Xia Blade!"

The Great Xia King's face stiffened, and he nodded.

Although he had planned for this, at this moment... it was truly tragic. Su Yu thought he was acting, but he was genuinely heartbroken. The thought of being inferior to his grandson kept echoing in his mind!

Too tragic!

And Su Yu, not dwelling on Xia Longwu, turned his gaze to the second person, showing a hint of regret as he softly said, "Marquis Huoyun!"

Marquis Huoyun stepped out of the line.

Su Yu pondered for a moment and softly said, "You didn't break through... I don't blame you. Initially, because you were a Heavenly King, I didn't let you integrate into my world. It was only later that you did, and the Fire Dao was occupied by Tianhuo. Both you and Tianhuo followed the Fire Dao..."

Marquis Huoyun, in fact, had been with Su Yu longer than Tianhuo. Tianhuo was from the Fire God Race, resurrected from the dead, but at that time, Marquis Huoyun hadn't integrated into the path. The Fire Dao suited Tianhuo, so it was occupied by Tianhuo.

Su Yu paused for a moment before continuing, "You are now following the Path of Burning, which is different from the Fire Dao... You couldn't break through, probably because your comprehension of the Fire Dao is too deep, making it difficult to switch..."

Marquis Huoyun lowered his head and said, "Your Majesty, it's my own fault. The Path of Burning isn't much different from the Fire Dao, but I..."

Su Yu sighed, "You don't need to switch paths. The Path of Burning wasn't your forte to begin with. However, you don't need to go to the front lines this time. If one day, Tianhuo falls in battle... I'll give you his path!"

"......"

In the crowd, Tianhuo from the Fire God Race opened his mouth but was speechless for a long time.

I... have nothing to say!

And Su Yu quickly smiled, "Just kidding, the path of flames isn't limited to one! For example, Topsoil Spirit now cultivates the Five Elemental Art, which includes the path of flames. I will perfect this later!"

Marquis Huoyun, who had entered the Heavenly King level early on, hadn't broken through, which was indeed regrettable.

Su Yu judged that it wasn't necessarily Marquis Huoyun's lack of ability, but rather his insufficient comprehension of the Path of Burning. If he had followed the Fire Dao, he might have broken through.

But sometimes, it really comes down to luck.

Marquis Huoyun was somewhat disappointed, said nothing, and quickly stepped back.

"Grandstar..."

In the crowd, Grandstar stepped forward, also sighing, lowering his head as he said, "Your Majesty, I relinquish the Sword Dao! I wish to give it to Empyrean Cloud... I might really be getting old, my fighting spirit isn't what it used to be, and the Sword Dao is also a path of killing... As a swordsman, my killing intent is insufficient... I'm not as ambitious as Heavendoom, nor as spirited as Empyrean Cloud..."

This was the first guardian who supported Su Yu long ago, yet this time, he couldn't keep up with the team.

When Su Yu went to the Upper Realm, the only guardian he took was Grandstar.

Grandstar had been stronger than Heavendoom before, but after integrating into the Sword Dao, Heavendoom broke through, while Grandstar... remained at the Heavenly King level, unable to take that step.

Su Yu looked at him with some regret. Grandstar... Su Yu had actually given him many private lessons. Su Yu transformed into a half-dead spirit, met Xingyue, and formed an alliance with the ancient city...

It could be said that all of this started with Grandstar.

However, this early supporter, whether tired or lacking talent, had fallen behind even as Heavendoom stepped into the realm of the ruler of laws!

Su Yu was somewhat regretful, nodded slightly, and softly said, "The Sword Dao... then pass it to Empyrean Cloud!"

Below, Empyrean Cloud was both angry and disappointed, unable to help but scold, "If I knew you were so useless, why did you fight for the Sword Dao back then! Grandstar, I look down on you!"

She was somewhat disappointed, not too happy!

As a guardian, with a friendship spanning ten thousand years, sharing life and death, she didn't hope for Grandstar's failure to relinquish the Sword Dao.

Now that Grandstar had truly failed, Empyrean Cloud felt more disappointment and sadness than anything else!

Grandstar relinquishing the Sword Dao this time meant that catching up later was almost hopeless.

He had followed the Sword Dao, his forte, and even with Su Yu's constant help, he hadn't broken through!

This was different from Marquis Huoyun, who had delved too deeply into the Fire Dao and was now struggling to adapt to a similar path. Given time, he might still reach the realm of the ruler of laws with the Path of Burning.

And Su Yu hadn't asked him to relinquish the Path of Burning.

But Grandstar had given up the Sword Dao, and taking a path he wasn't skilled in, did he still have hope?

Grandstar was somewhat regretful, softly saying, "Empyrean Cloud, I may be useless, but... I hope you become stronger than me! Now, Hongmeng has stepped into the realm of the ruler of laws, and Heavendoom has too... I failed, but I hope you... can succeed!"

In the crowd, Hongmeng and Heavendoom both felt regretful.

Heavendoom muttered, "You always had to show off... You're a big fish, yet you insisted on playing with swords! Fine, this time you failed, but I think you'd be better off following the Water Dao. Big fish should play with water!"

Grandstar chuckled, "You, a monkey, calling me a big fish, have some nerve!"

Heavendoom pouted, too lazy to say anything.

And Su Yu, looking at Empyrean Cloud, softly said, "Empyrean Cloud, then the Sword Dao is yours to wield! Previously, Grandstar followed the Sword Dao, and you followed his path, which wasn't your forte, so you didn't break through... But if you follow the Sword Dao, there's still hope!"

Empyrean Cloud hadn't followed the Sword Dao before, and Su Yu hadn't included her in the list.

But now, following the Sword Dao, she might not instantly step into the realm like Xia Longwu, but there was still hope.

Empyrean Cloud nodded, said nothing, her mood indifferent.

Soon, Su Yu extracted Grandstar's Sword Dao and transferred it to Empyrean Cloud. Her aura surged instantly, spreading significantly, but she was still a bit short of the realm of the ruler of laws. However, there was at least a great hope!

At this point, the Great Xia King, Grandstar, and Marquis Huoyun had all failed.

Su Yu looked at the Space Ancient Emperor, a strong figure named Devour Space, who awkwardly said, "Your Majesty... I... I really can't..."

Su Yu smiled, "I understand!"

His Dao companion, Marquis Rift Space, had stepped into the realm of the ruler of laws. The key was that there was only one Space Dao, and it was wielded by Marquis Rift Space, making it difficult for Devour Space.

The key wasn't just that... but that he had secretly exchanged paths with Marquis Rift Space!

Su Yu knew about this and had even assisted a bit, but exchanging paths was something Su Yu didn't support.

Because the Space Ancient Emperor had integrated into Su Yu's world early on, occupying the Space Dao, while Lie Kong Marquis joined later. The Space Ancient Emperor even brought the entire Space Ancient Clan to merge with the Space Dao, seemingly intent on emulating the Five Elemental Race by strengthening a single Dao to an unparalleled level. 

Su Yu didn't fully agree with this approach, but he didn't stop them either. He preferred a hundred flowers to bloom, with everyone choosing their own Dao to merge with. However, some were accustomed to the Space Dao, and asking them to switch might not yield any results.

This was the fourth failure. The Dao didn't need to be changed; it was given to his Dao companion, which was why he felt embarrassed. According to the rules, he wasn't supposed to privately exchange Daos with others.

"Hetu..."

Su Yu looked at someone again. Hetu stepped forward, looking a bit confused. "Your Majesty?"

I've broken through! Why are you calling me?

Su Yu frowned slightly. "Weren't you walking the River Diagram Dao before? Why have you switched to the Petrification Dao?"

Hetu looked embarrassed and coughed lightly. "The Consort Qi integrated the Petrification Dao into the world. I found it quite powerful. I thought about it, and my ancestor, King Gong, also walked the Petrification Dao... it's a lineage... so... ahem, Your Majesty, you knew I switched Daos, right?"

He hadn't walked his previous Dao because Su Yu hadn't deeply comprehended it, and neither had he. So, within three months, he did one thing: he switched Daos! He switched to the Petrification Dao that Consort Qi had integrated!

Consort Qi had a deep understanding of this Dao, and over the past three months, Hetu had consulted her. Coupled with the fact that his ancestor, King Gong, also walked the Petrification Dao, he managed to advance using this Dao by the end of the three months!

Su Yu glared at him. You switched Daos, I know. But this matter still needs to be addressed.

Su Yu said solemnly, "Everyone, if you feel that a Dao doesn't suit you, don't rashly switch Daos! In my world, switching Daos isn't a big issue for now. I'm here to suppress it! But... that doesn't mean I'll always suppress it! Nor does it mean I'll always allow you to switch! Some Daos aren't complete or powerful enough. Switching might lead to your own demise! Next time, such matters must be decided by the Imperial Court. Anyone who dares to switch privately will be severely punished!"

The main issue was that some Daos weren't perfected by Su Yu. Randomly switching Daos could lead to personal ruin, and it could also cause losses and deviations in Su Yu's world.

Hetu quickly smiled and said, "Your Majesty's lesson is right. Next time, I won't act recklessly. I'll definitely report in advance!"

In fact, he was similar to the Space Ancient Emperor, but Hetu didn't mind. Su Yu was using this opportunity to warn others. The Space Ancient Emperor was an outsider, so it wasn't appropriate to reprimand him, but it was suitable to use his own people for this purpose!

Understood! No wonder he called me out; it was to set an example!

Hetu didn't mind and was quite pleased. As a smart person, he knew this meant he was trusted, which was great!

Su Yu ignored him and continued, "Wan Tiansheng, your Dao of the Seven Emotions and Six Desires..."

Su Yu hesitated for a moment and said, "I see that you have dispersed your mastery across multiple Daos, not just one. You've mastered over ten Daos, but none to the extent of complete control. Can your current strength rival some rulers of laws?"

Without waiting for a response, Su Yu addressed the others, "If any of you think you can rival a ruler of laws, you can appeal... Everyone knows Wan Tiansheng and Lantian's situation. They opened their own Daos later on. I look at strength... Don't think I'm biased."

Everyone nodded, not saying much.

Wan Tiansheng and a few others, including Fat Ball, had opened their own Daos. This was indeed the case. Strength had always been the measure, not realm.

Wan Tiansheng smiled and said, "Your Majesty, I can't speak for others... But I see Heavendoom eager to try. How about I spar with Daoist Heavendoom?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, nodded, and smiled, "Sure!"

Below, Heavendoom grinned, baring his teeth. "I'm a ruler of laws! You, Wan Tiansheng, have mastered many Daos... but none to the ruler of laws level. You want to fight me?"

People always said Heavendoom never won a fight. This time, he really wanted to teach Wan Tiansheng a lesson!

"Come fight!"

Heavendoom laughed loudly and charged out. Wan Tiansheng smiled, adjusted his robe, and followed him out.

Su Yu didn't watch. Everyone else wasn't interested either. Since Wan Tiansheng had chosen Heavendoom, the outcome was already decided, no doubt about it.

Su Yu continued to look around, focusing on the Fate Clan. Here, Tianming had become a ruler of laws, achieving this outside. As for the Fate Emperor, Su Yu glanced at him and raised an eyebrow, "Aren't you walking the Divination Dao?"

The Fate Emperor smiled, "Your Majesty, the Fate Clan isn't limited to divination. I'm walking the Path of Fortune Observation!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "You've taken a shortcut. Your combat power isn't impressive, but you've indeed become a ruler of laws. Has Tian Ce given up?"

He looked at Tian Ce, another member of the Fate Clan, who assisted Marquis Destiny in the Upper Realm. When Marquis Destiny wasn't around, Tian Ce managed the Fate Clan.

Hearing Su Yu's words, Tian Ce stepped forward and said softly, "Your Majesty, I'm still walking the conventional path of the Fate Clan. I can merge with Marquis Destiny's path!"

Su Yu nodded, "That's fine too!"

This was the fifth person to voluntarily give up. He hadn't chosen another path but decided to merge with the Divination Dao controlled by Marquis Destiny.

Out of 30 strong individuals, excluding Wan Tiansheng and Lantian, five had failed.

The others, including General Yingwu, had succeeded.

On the Hundred Battle side, those who joined later, like Wu Ji, quickly reached the ruler of laws level, as did Marquis Nanxi and Marquis Zhennan.

Tongtian, similar to Wan Tiansheng, hadn't integrated into Su Yu's world. However, after digesting the portals he had consumed, he vaguely possessed the combat power of a fifth-tier ruler of laws.

In Su Yu's view, this didn't count as a ruler of laws, but he was lenient with Tongtian.

Doubao, Flatbread, and September also reached this level, though they didn't walk the Devouring Dao. The difference wasn't significant.

Topsoil Spirit also benefited, as the entire Five Elemental Race was merging with this Dao, pushing him to the ruler of laws level.

As for the Hou Pseudo Emperor, Su Yu saw his weakness and specifically gave him the Devouring Dao. He felt pressured, but with Su Yu's special guidance, he barely broke through.

By this time, everyone else, including the Tea Plant, had reached the ruler of laws level.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng returned gracefully, and shortly after, Heavendoom came back with a bruised face, looking helpless. Everyone stifled their laughter, and Su Yu smiled too. It wasn't surprising. Wan Tiansheng had likely merged with his past self, mastering over ten Daos. Although he hadn't fully mastered them, defeating Heavendoom wasn't difficult.

Out of 30 people, 5 failed, resulting in 25 who reached the ruler of laws level.

Xia Longwu had just become a ruler of laws, making it 26.

In fact, that was quite a lot!

Su Yu looked at those not on the list, glancing at Marquis Dingjun, who had boasted grandly that day. Marquis Dingjun looked frustrated. He wasn't walking the Spear Dao, so it wasn't easy to advance.

He hadn't managed to advance!

26 strong individuals with ruler of laws strength, plus the previous 12, made a total of 38!

Including Su Yu, that made 39.

Empyrean Cloud had taken the Sword Dao and might soon break through. If Empyrean Cloud could break through, that would make 40.

According to Xingyue, the Human Emperor's side had only a little over 40.

Su Yu took a deep breath and said solemnly, "That's everyone! Has the Martial Emperor returned?"

"Present!"

In the corner, the Martial Emperor, who had been hiding, stood up straight when everyone looked over. He wouldn't admit he almost fell asleep!

Su Yu frowned slightly, nodded, and continued, "Now that everyone is here, let's merge with our past selves one last time to strengthen ourselves. Once everyone is done, we'll head upstream!"

"Of course, we can't leave the Myriad Realms without a single strong individual. That would be too risky!"

Su Yu looked at these people for a long time, then at Wan Tiansheng and the Great Zhou King. Usually, when he left, he would leave one of these two behind.

After glancing at the Great Zhou King, Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Great Zhou King, stay behind to guard the Myriad Realms!"

The Great Zhou King was a bit surprised. Me, stay behind?

Su Yu looked at him and said solemnly, "You stay! I trust that nothing will happen to the Myriad Realms before I return! Even if someone temporarily emerges from the Gate of Hell, you can handle it! Great Zhou King, don't let me down again! I can understand some things, but... if you keep disappointing me, you can leave!"

The Great Zhou King's face tightened, and he said solemnly, "Your Majesty, before your return, I won't let anything happen to the Myriad Realms!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. With the Great Zhou King here, even if a strong individual emerged, it wouldn't be a big problem.

"Great Xia King, Grandstar, Fire Cloud Marquis... although you've switched Daos, your strength isn't weak. Assist the Great Zhou King well and guard the Myriad Realms! There's work to be done even in the rear!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Perhaps the front line will face a crisis, and I'll need reinforcements from the rear! I hope that after I leave, you can all become rulers of laws and come to my aid!"

"Empyrean Cloud, you've taken the Sword Dao and might soon reach the ruler of laws level... but this time, you don't need to follow. Don't rush; don't make mistakes in haste!"

Without the Great Zhou King, not counting Empyrean Cloud, there were exactly 38 strong individuals—a lucky number!

Su Yu hesitated for a moment and added, "Lantian, you stay too!"

In the crowd, Lantian's eyes flickered, and he nodded, "Your Majesty, I understand!"

Chapter 855: Preparations for the Frontline

The Great Zhou King had a peculiar look in his eyes, suspecting that Su Yu was wary of him. In truth, Su Yu intended for Lantian to coordinate with Xia Huyou and the others, ensuring a powerful force was ready to support him at any critical moment.

"The Tea Plant will stay as well!" 

The young girl, who was the embodiment of the Tea Plant, was slightly taken aback. Am I not going either?

Even Fat Ball was puzzled. "The Tea Plant isn't going?"

Su Yu nodded. "The Tea Plant... I might have other significant uses for it later. It's best not to reveal it too much now! The Tea Plant, Lantian, and the Great Zhou King will all stay. Including me, that makes exactly 36!"

Su Yu chuckled, "I prefer the number 36!"

Everyone was speechless. So, you're even choosing a number you like!

Thirty-six powerful figures would head to the frontline!

The forces left behind weren't weak either. Besides a few rulers of laws, there were numerous Daofuse and Heavenly King experts.

Su Yu quickly declared, "Let's go, merge with our past selves for one final enhancement, and then... to the frontline!"

...

This time, everyone followed Su Yu to merge with their past selves.

Su Yu, however, had other tasks to attend to. He needed to fulfill his promises. On one hand, he began assisting Xia Longwu in strengthening his blade dao. On the other, he handed a page of the Book of Time to Xia Longwu. Although Xia Longwu wasn't particularly concerned, since Su Yu offered it, he accepted.

Su Yu also shared the fortune-sharing technique, but as for conferring titles, he hadn't done so yet. There was no rush.

In fact, Su Yu hadn't mentioned that there was another powerful figure truly guarding the rear—Marquis Zhennan.

Su Yu was strong, and so was Marquis Zhennan!

Currently, Su Yu had stepped into the second tier, and Marquis Zhennan, being the embodiment of Su Yu's entire world, was also quite formidable. After breaking the seal's shackles, Marquis Zhennan could now be considered a strong fourth-tier or a weak third-tier expert.

He was even stronger than the Tea Plant and Lantian who stayed behind!

As for the Great Xia King, Su Yu didn't have him merge with his own world. Instead, he quietly took the Great Xia King to the River of Time to choose a dao to merge with.

The Great Xia King was also appointed by Su Yu as the leader of the secret guards!

Lantian was designated as the deputy leader by Su Yu.

The Great Xia King was more suited to be the leader, while Lantian was better at lurking in the shadows, delivering fatal blows to enemies.

As for Liu Hong and a few others, Su Yu didn't make many arrangements.

...

Once everyone had finished merging with their past selves, their strengths had all improved somewhat.

Especially the Martial Emperor, who officially stepped into the second tier.

At this point, Su Yu's forces were truly formidable!

Liu Hong was also responsible for connecting Su Yu's world, the River of Time, and the Celestial River of Death, extending the influence of Su Yu's world into the River of Time.

This allowed Su Yu to draw power from his own world even within the River of Time.

Thus, five more days passed.

Over three months after the end of the Myriad Realms War, Su Yu led a group of people, quietly heading upstream in the River of Time!
