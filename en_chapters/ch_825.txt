Chapter 825: Trust My Words! (Please Subscribe)

Even Su Yu had thought that the Martial Emperor would remain fierce and unyielding, but that wasn't the case!

Su Yu looked disappointed as he gazed at the Martial Emperor and suddenly sighed, "In this world, there are no pure warriors left... just cowards afraid of death!"

The Martial Emperor's expression changed unpredictably! What kind of talk was this? As if warriors aren't afraid of death? Of course, I'm afraid! Damn it, I've been sealed for so long and only just got out. How could I not fear death?

And you, this brat, are not just any emperor. A typical emperor might admire your unparalleled bravery and treat you with respect... but not Su Yu. He truly intends to kill!

Yes, the Martial Emperor could feel it. Su Yu... was preparing to send him off! He genuinely wanted to eliminate him! How could he not be afraid?

At this moment, the Martial Emperor stiffened his neck and remained silent. I've surrendered! If I've surrendered, will you still kill me? I haven't even done anything; I just talked a bit. I haven't killed any of your people, so why are you so eager to kill me? Isn't that excessive?

After a light sigh, Su Yu quickly shifted to a faint smile, "You want to surrender?"

The Martial Emperor glared with his massive eyes, looking fierce and vicious!

"I want to surrender!"

He was extremely fierce! Yes, I want to surrender, so what? Is that not allowed?

"But I see that you might soon step into the realm of a second-tier ruler of laws. Once I'm outside my world, I won't be your match. How can I control someone as powerful as you?"

Su Yu chuckled, "If I let you sever your path and merge into my world, it would be a pity. If you merge now, I could become much stronger, but you would only become a third or fourth-tier ruler of laws at best. That would be too wasteful!"

Indeed, it would be a waste! The Martial Emperor was about to enter the second tier, becoming a true overlord, akin to the Four Extremes Human Kings of ancient times. Severing his path now would make it difficult to quickly cultivate back to the second tier, especially since Su Yu's world was not yet fully developed.

"But if I don't let you merge, and you go outside, my world won't be easy to move. If you backstab me at any time... I can't trust you!"

The Martial Emperor felt awkward. Damn it, am I too strong? Is that my fault? What do you want me to do? I'm helpless too!

Su Yu sighed, "So, I wasn't planning to subdue you. For a formidable enemy like you, the best solution is to kill!"

The Martial Emperor was utterly frustrated! This was why Su Yu was so quick to decide to eliminate him.

Su Yu smiled, "I thought you, as a warrior, wouldn't bow your head. If I sent you to the Gate of Hell, you might not agree, so I didn't bother negotiating with you."

The Martial Emperor remained silent. Damn you! Just like that!

"But now, you want to surrender. If I send you to the Gate of Hell, I feel like I'm losing out. But if I don't send you away, I'm afraid... it's a dilemma!"

Su Yu sighed, "Your surrender has put me in a difficult position!"

The Martial Emperor felt awkward. So, my surrender has made you even more dissatisfied?

These scholars are truly troublesome. They calculate everything, and in the end, they don't even want to accept a surrender!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King suddenly stepped forward and bowed, "Your Majesty, this old minister has an idea!"

"Let's hear it!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King with a meaningful gaze. The Great Zhou King didn't meet Su Yu's eyes and quickly said, "The Martial Emperor is powerful, and Your Majesty is not entirely at ease, fearing the Martial Emperor's rebellion... This old minister has an idea: separate the spirit from the flesh!"

Su Yu smiled, "Tell me, what do you mean by separating the spirit from the flesh?"

"Simply put, separate the sea of will from the physical body!"

The Great Zhou King quickly explained, "This is actually a form of sealing..."

The Martial Emperor's face turned ashen, and he angrily said, "I've surrendered, and I won't accept being sealed!"

If you seal me, I might as well be dead! I've surrendered, but that doesn't mean I want to be sealed. I'd rather fight Su Yu to the death!

The Great Zhou King ignored him and continued, "This is called sealing, but it's not really sealing! It's just artificially dividing a person into two parts! The Martial Emperor's physical body can be suppressed within the Human Lord Seal, while his sea of will can transform into a human form and move freely! Without the power of the physical body, the Martial Emperor is still strong, but he would be downgraded! If he's currently second-tier, after the separation, he would only be third-tier... Then Your Majesty can suppress him at any time!"

"And the Martial Emperor can live freely. If there's a great battle, or when Your Majesty can control the Martial Emperor, he can be allowed to reunite his spirit and flesh, quickly restoring his combat power!"

The Martial Emperor raised his eyebrows and glared, "Spirit and flesh separation... Normally, it can be separated, but even if separated, the physical body is hard to summon, and the sea of will can return to the physical body at any time!"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "The Martial Emperor knows quite a bit, and that's true. However, the method of spirit and flesh separation can artificially create a barrier, preventing the spirit and flesh from combining, thus avoiding a quick restoration of combat power!"

"This also requires Your Majesty's Heaven Gate to assist, delving deep into the River of Time, and creating a barrier before the Great Dao..."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Your method might be feasible, perhaps... you've tried it before?"

Su Yu smiled meaningfully, quickly shifting his gaze from the Great Zhou King to the Martial Emperor, and said lightly, "Martial Emperor, what do you think?"

The Martial Emperor's expression changed unpredictably!

Half-sealed!

This wasn't a full seal, just a seal of the physical body, allowing the sea of will and Great Dao to detach and move freely. He gritted his teeth, "How long do you plan to seal me?"

Su Yu calculated for a moment and smiled, "Seal you until I can kill you outside my world!"

The Martial Emperor felt awkward. So, you need to have at least the combat power of a second-tier ruler of laws outside your world, which means you need to be at least at the peak of the second tier within your world.

"How long will that take?"

Su Yu calculated again and smiled, "From now on, my opportunities for improvement are fewer. I've integrated everything I could. Currently, I'm at the mid to lower second-tier level within my world... I need at least one major opportunity!"

Su Yu smiled, "Whenever the opportunity comes, that's when it'll be about time. It's hard to say."

"No problem!"

This time, the Martial Emperor agreed readily because he calculated that it took Su Yu... a year? Maybe just a year! Damn it, I didn't remember, but when I calculated, it scared me to death. So, the seal might last three months, maybe five months, and at most, it might not exceed a year.

Alright! At most a year, and my sea of will can still move freely. It's like Su Yu didn't unseal me in advance. It would take me at least one or two years to unseal myself. Alright, thinking this way, he felt much more comfortable.

Forced by circumstances!

At this moment, if he refused, Su Yu might still want to kill him.

That's what he thought, but the Martial Emperor still wanted to struggle a bit, "I won't rebel. If you don't seal me, I won't either. I still have credibility!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Credibility? If I were Su Yu, if I were just myself... I could trust you, but I... am not just Su Yu."

It's that simple! If I were Su Yu, I wouldn't bother with you. Do whatever you want! But... I'm a strong person, a Human Lord, a new emperor!

These words were calm, but at this moment, someone sighed in their heart.

Behind him, Wan Tiansheng and others had complex expressions.

He said, if he were Su Yu...

In fact, he is, but he's not just Su Yu.

If it were Su Yu himself, he wouldn't care what happened to the Martial Emperor, but now he's the leader of the human race, the master of the Luminous Domain Mansion.

The day he became the Human Lord, like the Human Emperor, he was shackled!

For peerless experts, sometimes fame and fortune are just shackles.

Su Yu probably desires to pursue the Dao more.

Wasn't the Human Emperor the same?

But in that era, the Human Emperor had no choice. The Culture King was unwilling, the Martial King was unreliable, the Control King had his own ideas, the Radiant King wasn't strong enough... Ultimately, the Human Emperor, a seeker of the Dao, had to take on these responsibilities.

In the eyes of outsiders, the Human Emperor was supreme, but in the Human Emperor's eyes, he probably wished to be like the Culture King, free and unrestrained.

Today's Su Yu is the same.

Wan Tiansheng and the others understood Su Yu very well!

They had truly watched Su Yu step by step reach this point, being forced onto this path. His friends, his mentors, his comrades, all pushed him to shoulder this burden.

So, Su Yu had no choice but to choose this path.

The freedom he longed for, the desire to act without restraint, was ultimately suppressed by responsibility.

He hadn't reached the level of the Human Emperor yet, but he was following in the Human Emperor's footsteps.

The Martial Emperor didn't fully understand, but at this moment, this warrior felt a slight sense of understanding. It was faint, but Su Yu's words just now made him feel that the Su Yu before him was somewhat different.

Different from the Su Yu who used to laugh and joke.

Because he wasn't just Su Yu, he couldn't agree to the Martial Emperor's request.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King spoke with a smile, looking at the Martial Emperor, "Martial Emperor, with His Majesty's progress, I think you'll soon be able to reunite your spirit and flesh! Besides, His Majesty won't hinder you from doing anything. It's just that your physical body needs to rest for a while!"

"You've been sealed for many years, and I see your physical body hasn't fully recovered. At this moment, it's not sealing but nurturing your body, healing old wounds... Once your body recovers, and your spirit and flesh reunite, I think reaching the second tier will be a natural progression!"

Is that so? That makes some sense!

The Martial Emperor thought for a moment, and opposite him, Su Yu looked at the Martial Emperor and said calmly, "Can you accept it? If not... you can self-destruct!"

"..."

The Martial Emperor cursed silently. If I can't accept it, can't you just send me to the Gate of Hell? What's with this self-destruct nonsense?

With a hint of resignation, the Martial Emperor maintained his fierce demeanor, "Nurturing the physical body... it's not impossible! My body indeed has some injuries, all thanks to that bastard Taishan. It's a fight to the death between us! So, I can temporarily place my body in your Human Lord Seal for nurturing!"

What a guy! He made it sound as if Su Yu was begging him to nurture his body, as if he was reluctantly agreeing to it!

Su Yu continued, "You previously mentioned you'd help me kill five rulers of laws. Before, you hadn't promised, so when you said you'd kill three, I pretended not to hear. But now... you've been defeated, so what you said is no longer a negotiation, but a must!"

Su Yu's eyes turned cold, "So, if you can't kill five rulers of laws, I'll eventually find a way to kill you!"

The Martial Emperor cursed inwardly again. Annoying!

"Fine!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Detach your physical body from your sea of consciousness. If you don't want your body anymore, you can go wherever you like, and I'll pretend you don't exist. If you want it, when I summon you, you must return!"

The Martial Emperor felt exhausted! He had lived freely all his life, been sealed all his life, and in the end, he was still being controlled by someone!

However, even if he lost, even if he admitted defeat, the Martial Emperor was still a man of dignity!

With a snort, the Martial Emperor sneered, making everyone think he was about to flip out. Suddenly, it was as if his soul left his body, and another Martial Emperor appeared, leaving his physical body behind.

The newly appeared Martial Emperor had a wild expression, "Then I'll leave my body here for nurturing for a while. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave. Call me if you need anything, but don't bother me if you don't!"

Boom!

The Martial Emperor fled! He ran quickly, not wanting to stay with Su Yu. It was too annoying; Su Yu's gaze was like that of a predator, irritating him. He was leaving!

As for having matters to attend to? Nonsense, he just didn't want to stay with Su Yu, okay? It was too embarrassing here.

Su Yu watched him leave without stopping him. He glanced at the Martial Emperor's body, casually removed the crown, and with a wave of his hand, the crown absorbed the body, disappearing into the world.

Only then did the Great Zhou King breathe a sigh of relief. In the next moment, he loudly proclaimed, "Congratulations, Your Majesty!"

"Emperor Yu has quelled the chaos of the Myriad Realms, a celebration for our Luminous Domain Mansion!"

His voice shook the heavens!

A great victory!

When the Martial Emperor disappeared, when he admitted defeat, when Zhou Ji and the others were driven away, Su Yu had won!

The chaos that had lasted for a hundred thousand years was quelled by Su Yu!

Perhaps there would be a series of troubles and crises in the future, but at this moment, the chaos of the Myriad Realms was completely quelled by Su Yu!

As the tenth Human Lord, Su Yu accomplished what his predecessors could not!

At this moment, cheers resounded, and hundreds of powerful beings shouted loudly.

"Congratulations, Your Majesty, for unifying the heavens and shaking the Three Realms!"

"Congratulations, Your Majesty!"

The cheers continued!

Some of the older generation of powerhouses were even moved to tears.

They had won!

After a hundred thousand years, in this tide led by Su Yu, they had won, a complete victory!

The myriad races were subdued, the Hundred Battle King was slain, Zhou Ji was suppressed, the Martial Emperor was subdued...

The undead submitted, the Myriad Realms submitted, the heavens submitted!

At this moment, Su Yu's achievements were not inferior to those of the Human Emperor.

The Human Emperor and others might have been stronger, but due to the circumstances of the era, the powerhouses of this tide were weaker. However, the overall situation was not much better than in the past. Su Yu spent four years to quell the calamity of the Myriad Realms!

Such achievements marked the official beginning of the New Yu Era!

"We won..."

Su Yu also revealed a faint smile. They had won, although it was only a partial victory, but at this moment, he had indeed won. At this moment, he was the number one in the heavens!

In the world, fortune surged, the fortune left by Zhou Ji, the fortune released by the Heaven Monitoring Marquis, Su Yu's own fortune, the fortune left after the Martial Emperor's submission...

Countless fortunes boiled!

Moments later, amidst some people's shock, the Heaven Monitoring Marquis unexpectedly reappeared in the void.

Many were surprised.

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis... had been resurrected?

Su Yu also looked at the Heaven Monitoring Marquis from afar. At this moment, the Heaven Monitoring Marquis had a complicated expression, while Su Yu was extremely calm, "Are you also afraid of death? Like the Martial Emperor, did you choose to live in disgrace?"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis lowered his head, slightly bowing to Su Yu, "I... just want... to witness a legend once more..."

"Living in disgrace is living in disgrace, why find excuses!"

Su Yu wasn't too concerned, calmly saying, "You were originally formed from the spirit of fortune, and now, you are reborn from the fortune of my world! The Culture King liked to leave things unfinished, not telling you the truth. I don't care about these things, whether unfinished or not, it doesn't matter! You should know, you merge with the fortune of my world, I am strong, you are strong, I am weak, you are weak, if you are killed, I will also be implicated by you..."

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis remained silent.

Su Yu continued, "I should have erased your memory, even not allowing you to be resurrected again... but I trust myself, the concept of fortune is just an aid, I won't consider it everything! Knowing more might also be a good thing, having a sense of awe!"

Knowing more, he knows fear!

Knowing less, he dares to rebel!

Su Yu's expression was cold, "In that case, you shall live in this world. Without my permission, you are not allowed to leave this world! The Martial Emperor can leave, you do not have that qualification. If you leave, I will destroy you!"

"I dare not!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis lowered his head and disappeared into the world.

Su Yu looked at the others, glancing around, revealing a smile, "Everything is quite good, very smooth, we... have won!"

A great victory!

In one battle, the chaos of the Myriad Realms was quelled, without paying too high a price.

However, soon, Su Yu's expression turned serious, "However, such a victory is only temporary! The Gate of Hell has not been sealed, the Human Emperor and others have not returned, the strong of the myriad races have left, Zhou Ji and his mother have left, the Martial Emperor is not truly submissive... much remains to be done!"

"We can be happy, but... this is just the beginning!"

"The future will be even harder!"

Su Yu's voice shook the heavens, even reaching the lower realms, carrying majesty and solemnity.

"We have won! But such a victory is just a small victory! Worth celebrating, worth rejoicing! But the road ahead is just beginning!"

"Everyone, I do not know what the future holds! But as long as I am here, I will continue to lead you, to fight on, to kill all our enemies. Those who are my enemies are my foes, take the heads of the foes, destroy their race, kill their bloodline, sever their roots, annihilate their souls!"

"In these heavens, in this chaos, wherever I reach, invincible! I am invincible, you are invincible, no enemies, no foes!"

As his words fell, there was a moment of silence, and then, the shouts rose again!

"Invincible!"

"Invincible!"

The Human Race would once again give birth to an invincible emperor!

A new emperor!

Only at this moment did Su Yu reveal a smile.

The heavens trembled, some fortune and power of laws once again merged into Su Yu's world.

And in the next moment, Su Yu suddenly reached out and grabbed, a bamboo pole was caught in his hand. The previously solemn scene, the previously solemn atmosphere, suddenly disappeared in an instant.

At this moment, Heavendoom wanted to fly to the sky, suddenly, with a bang, behind him, a large bamboo stick struck, with a bang, knocking Heavendoom unconscious!

Marquis Giant Bamboo looked innocent, holding the bamboo stick, with an innocent look, blinking at Su Yu, with a silly smile, "I... accidentally bumped into him, he... is so weak!"

First unite against the outside!

First take down Heavendoom!

In the next moment, March loudly said, "Your Majesty, I was originally a Heavenly Venerable, but unfortunately, my grandfather is still alive..."

That's called unfortunate!

"So, I couldn't advance to a ruler of laws, Your Majesty, this world of yours, I feel some great paths are too wasteful for me, I might as well walk this bamboo pole path, Your Majesty, if I walk the bamboo pole path, I will surely become one of the strongest under your command, fighting for you everywhere!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo smiled foolishly, "Your Majesty, March walks the path of body forging, actually closer to the path of the physical body, but I, I actually walk the bamboo path, it's still different, this bamboo... I see it, it might be tailor-made for me! I was originally a Heavenly King, and now I'm not weaker than March, Your Majesty, this bamboo pole path is really suitable for me!"

In the corner, September, gathering courage, loudly said, "Your Majesty, I walk the devouring path, but my weapon is bamboo, bamboo is originally a weapon, why take the weapon as the path..."

The Iron Devourer Race was almost fighting!

This bamboo pole, really a good thing.

The object of the Human Ancestor's Dao!

No matter what the Human Ancestor was, it was undeniable that the Human Ancestor was very strong, this was beyond doubt, just look at the scene Su Yu saw, easily knocking a ruler of laws to death with a bamboo pole, that was invincible!

At this moment, the battle was over, and everyone should divide the spoils!

This bamboo pole might be the biggest benefit this time!

And those suitable for this item were actually not many.

The Iron Devourer Race was indeed suitable, Heavendoom... actually barely suitable!

As for others, they didn't fight too much, not that they couldn't use it, but using it might not be able to exert the greatest effect, wasting the bamboo pole, then Su Yu might have trouble.

At this moment, Heavendoom, who had been knocked unconscious, suddenly opened his eyes, cursed loudly, and then shouted, "Your Majesty, I am your loyal subordinate, I was the first eternal to fight for you!"

Did you forget?

Alright, even if not the first, I was among the first!

You can't forget me!

Su Yu laughed, the previous solemnity swept away, seeing their eyes full of desire, he said with a smile, "This item is indeed a treasure, a good thing, but... it may not be suitable for everyone, maybe it will also bear some karma, the karma with the Human Ancestor!"

Su Yu smiled, "The Human Ancestor... if nothing unexpected happens, I will definitely meet him! Such a powerful being, most likely not dead, if not dead, with karma, meeting him is only a matter of time!"

"Encountering him, you have merged his Dao-seeking treasure, which might lead to some entanglement of karma..."

As soon as these words were spoken, many drew a sharp breath. The Human Ancestor was still a terrifying existence!

Su Yu chuckled, "Afraid?"

Heavendoom stiffened his neck, "Not afraid! Your Majesty can defeat him..."

Su Yu laughed, "Nonsense! Is the Human Ancestor necessarily a villain? Don't be misled by Hundred Battle and Yu. Their invitation to the Human Ancestor is just their own agenda. After all, the Human Ancestor was a figure who led humanity to glory in ancient times! He might not even care about being invited; perhaps he's living freely behind the Gate of Hell!"

"Whether to fight or not, we'll decide when we meet him!"

Looking at the crowd, Su Yu smiled, "How about this, Heavendoom, March, Giant Bamboo, let's leave September out of this. Among you three, whoever first masters their own Dao and becomes a ruler of laws in my world, this item... will be yours. I'll help you integrate it into your Dao!"

Upon hearing this, Heavendoom bared his teeth, "But March is a Heavenly Venerable..."

Can I compete with him? March is a Heavenly Venerable and might soon master the integrated Dao. Currently, March has chosen the path of body forging in Su Yu's world, Giant Bamboo follows the path of bamboo transformation, and Heavendoom follows the path of the great club.

He was now considered a Heavenly King, but March was a Heavenly Venerable. Competing with Giant Bamboo was one thing, but how could he compete with March?

March, on the other hand, was smiling so broadly that his eyes were almost white with happiness. It seemed the treasure was his!

Su Yu lightly laughed, "Comprehending the Dao isn't about who is stronger. This is more about using your brain! With a good mind, you might comprehend the Dao in a day. Inspiration can strike at any moment!"

Alright then! Heavendoom could only accept this. Otherwise, his chances were the smallest. Now, at least he had a chance.

Su Yu continued, "Besides this item, there's also the chaotic will!"

Over there, the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger were practically drooling. Give it to us; we're good chaotic beasts. Just give it to us. You don't have anyone else who can use it anyway. We participated in the battle this time too!

Su Yu smiled, "I still have use for it. I need to summon a few more ancient chaotic beasts, defeat them, and integrate them into my world... Of course, I won't summon too many, and the ancient beasts on the other side might not be too foolish. Some might not fear death and come, and then we'll kill them! After we've killed some, half of this chaotic will shall be used to upgrade the Tea Plant, and the rest..."

Su Yu looked at the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger, saying calmly, "You two, your intentions are unclear, your attitudes uncertain. Even if you fought for me, it was under coercion! However, I, Su Yu, owe no one! The remaining half will be split between you two. If you can advance, then advance. If not, don't say anything more!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger hurriedly said, "Thank you, Emperor Yu!"

Not bad at all! At least the two of them still got half, and there was hope for advancement!

At this moment, Su Yu no longer spoke of this and continued, "Those who have advanced to become rulers of laws, I believe you will soon master the Dao you have integrated and become rulers of laws once more. For those who haven't advanced, do so as soon as possible!"

"Now, my world has grown much stronger. Even if you're outside, you can exert about eighty percent of your strength, unlike before when at least half was weakened!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "We have won, but time is not abundant. According to my judgment, in about a year, the Human Emperor and the others might automatically return to the Myriad Realms!"

"Passively waiting for their return... might not be a good thing!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "According to their speed, their return might cause significant fluctuations in the River of Time, leading to the opening of the Gate of Hell, Heaven Gate, and even the unknown Human Gate! At that time, it would be a disaster!"

"Therefore, within a year, we must actively go to their aid and confront the strong of the myriad races!"

"In fact, I won't wait until the last moment to go. For me, once I go upstream and stay too long, the situation will become uncontrollable!"

"Perhaps in three months, maybe five, I might take people up to participate in the battle! Because you can't just go and defeat the myriad races! The myriad races have many rulers of laws. They're not desperate now because they can naturally return... Once we go, it might ignite their fighting spirit, making the battle even more intense!"

"But, is our strength enough?"

Su Yu shook his head, "Not enough, the gap is too large! Even by the standards of the late ancient era, on our side, if I leave my world, I'm only a third-class ruler of laws. Even if the Martial Emperor advances... becoming second-class, relying on him is less reliable than not!"

"Others, once they leave the world, are probably only fourth or fifth-class rulers of laws!"

"In a short time, it's hard to improve, so if strength isn't enough, we make up for it with numbers!"

"When there are many rulers of laws, some strong ones can naturally free up to deal with the strong of the myriad races, without needing to waste energy on the weak!"

Currently, upstream, there must be strong humans who can fight several at once, which is actually very wasteful!

Everyone suddenly became serious. Yes, Su Yu had always been so proactive. If he said a year, he might really go upstream to participate in the battle in three months!

At that time, if you're not a ruler of laws, it would be difficult to participate!

Su Yu continued, "There are still opportunities for everyone to improve!"

Su Yu said loudly, "The unsealed Gate of Hell is an opportunity! And next, since no one is stopping me, I might delve deeper into the River of Time, extracting some power of the Dao to strengthen my world!"

In this way, the Master of Time might really want to kill Su Yu.

Too excessive!

Su Yu laughed again, "If it really doesn't work, I'll break the Human Emperor's Dao and integrate it into my world. It's better than him leaving it there!"

The Great Zhou King was speechless!

This... alright, you're really ruthless!

"Not only that!"

Su Yu continued, "I will strive for more opportunities for everyone to grow stronger! Don't think that I can conquer the heavens alone... If I were truly alone, I wouldn't have won today's battle! So, I need everyone's help, and in fact, this is also self-rescue for everyone!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "Your Majesty, we all understand this..."

Su Yu coldly said, "You understand nothing! If you did, you wouldn't have been so unhelpful all this time!"

The Great Zhou King looked innocent, "Your Majesty, I..."

Su Yu coldly stared at him, "A fine separation of spirit and flesh, are you the spirit or the flesh? Probably the spirit, where's your flesh?"

"......"

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, "Your Majesty truly misunderstood..."

Su Yu snorted, "I can't be bothered to expose you, always showing off! If it weren't for your efforts, I would have killed you today!"

The Great Zhou King was helpless!

Su Yu frowned at him and suddenly said, "Where did most of your power go? Is it fighting upstream? Unlikely!"

The Great Zhou King bared his teeth, afraid Su Yu would continue guessing. At this moment, he had no choice but to quickly transmit his voice, "Your Majesty... I... I really have my difficulties! If I didn't, I would have given everything for Your Majesty and joined the battle long ago!"

I have my difficulties!

He was really afraid Su Yu would keep guessing, especially since there were so many people here, and Su Yu's guesses were always accurate. He was very worried.

Seeing his worried expression, Su Yu frowned and suddenly waved his hand. The world twisted, and he and the Great Zhou King appeared in a deserted place. Su Yu said solemnly, "Speak, what's going on!"

The Great Zhou King looked helpless, "Your Majesty... I..."

"Can't say?"

At this point, what can't be said?

Su Yu frowned!

The Great Zhou King gritted his teeth. At this point, maybe... maybe he could say something. Although he thought this might make Su Yu despair, this madman was much stronger in mentality than Hundred Battle.

He hesitated for a while, then quickly gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, "In fact, the Human Emperor is seriously injured! Very serious! His Majesty has been holding on until now, actually... actually, it's all a facade! Every battle consumes life, consumes foundation! Therefore, His Majesty urgently needs the Myriad Realms to rescue him, and he can't let the myriad races return. Once they return... it will be hard to hide His Majesty's condition!"

"Now, the Human Emperor can still hold on because the myriad races fear him and dare not fight him to the death!"

"They are all worried that if the Human Emperor gets angry, he might go down with a few emperors!"

"So, until now, the human race can persist, but once they return... it will be completely exposed!"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a while and then said, "I did hide some things, but this is what a subject of the Human Emperor must do. I once trusted Hundred Battle, almost... almost buried all of the Human Emperor's foundation. Fortunately, he showed anomalies, and I noticed!"

"Otherwise... the consequences would be unimaginable!"

He said with lingering fear, "If Hundred Battle hadn't changed so quickly, maybe... the human race would have been completely defeated in the last tide!"

Su Yu frowned slightly, "So, you've been hiding things from me, saying half and leaving half, afraid of being tricked by Hundred Battle?"

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, yes, that's about right.

"Then today, there's nothing you want to tell me, the Human Emperor's serious injury is also a secret, right?"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a while, "Not too secret, the myriad races actually know, the human race also knows, but how serious His Majesty's injury is... no one knows! I can only say that the Human Emperor now... is just a facade, if this continues, he might... fall!"

Su Yu frowned, if the Human Emperor died, that would be a huge problem.

The Human Emperor is a belief!

At least for those ancient strong humans, if he falls, Su Yu can say without exaggeration, the entire ancient human strong will collapse instantly!

No matter who dies, the Human Emperor cannot die.

Otherwise, this battle can't be fought!

Even if Su Yu is confident, he understands that at this moment, he absolutely cannot replace the Human Emperor!

Su Yu frowned and suddenly said, "Do you still have contact with the Human Emperor?"

Chapter 844: The Hidden Truth

Great Zhou King fell silent once more, shaking his head, then nodding, and finally shaking his head again. "I... I... I can't say, I shouldn't say. I'm worried..."

Su Yu frowned, "Worried about what?"

With a bitter expression, Great Zhou King replied, "Your Majesty, up until today, I have come to understand you quite well. But as you said, you are not just Su Yu, and I am not just the Great Zhou King. I am the leader of the Human Emperor's secret guards! I must ensure the safety of the Human Emperor, or else there will be catastrophic consequences! The fewer people who know about this, the better. Apart from Your Majesty, no one else knows that the Human Emperor is actually in a critical condition..."

Su Yu inhaled sharply, "Is it that serious?"

"More serious than Your Majesty imagines!"

Great Zhou King spoke bitterly, "With less than half the power of a ruler of laws, he is fighting against hundreds of rulers of laws. The Human Emperor alone is holding back several top-tier rulers of laws, and he hasn't had the chance or time to heal... His persistence until today is due to his unwillingness to give up."

Suddenly, a thought struck Su Yu, and his expression changed, "Are you... guarding the Human Emperor's true body?"

Great Zhou King remained silent.

Su Yu inhaled again, "Spirit and flesh separation... Does this mean the Human Emperor is in such a state? His true body is no longer in the upper reaches, but his willpower is waging war and deterring enemies, while you, also in a state of spirit and flesh separation, have your physical body, which holds most of your power, guarding the Human Emperor's true body?"

Is that the case?

He wasn't entirely sure, but today, Great Zhou King had revealed a lot of information—about the Human Emperor's critical condition, spirit and flesh separation, nurturing the physical body...

It seemed as if he was deliberately guiding Su Yu to think this way!

Great Zhou King remained silent for a moment, then lowered his head, "Your Majesty, please don't ask anymore! If you meet the Human Emperor, everything will become clear! But I can tell you, spirit and flesh separation has a flaw. If the physical body collapses, the willpower will also collapse! So, the fewer people who know about this, the better! Even I don't dare to say that no one would despair enough to betray the Human Emperor!"

He spoke bitterly, "If the Human Emperor falls, Your Majesty, do you think this war can still be fought?"

Su Yu shook his head, "If he dies, then there's no way to fight! So, he's actually holding on, pretending to be strong, playing a bluff with the myriad races, isn't he?"

"More or less!"

Great Zhou King sighed, "I don't know the specifics, but I can guess some of it! So, I'm also anxious, I'm also afraid, and that's why I've been trying to bring out all the remaining resources and good things of the human race over the years, unless there's no way to bring them out, I can only guide some people to take them away!"

As he spoke, Great Zhou King sighed again, "Your Majesty, at this point, perhaps only you can save the Human Emperor, save all beings, save those ancient powerhouses!"

Su Yu frowned, "You really think highly of me. Also, if I go out now and spread the news that the Human Emperor is about to die, what will happen?"

Great Zhou King was silent for a moment, "Everyone will think that Your Majesty wants to seize power from the Human Emperor!"

As for him dying, who would believe that?

Su Yu squinted at him, "Old fox, you're still as cunning as ever! Do you think that since I, Su Yu, speak nine falsehoods for every truth, no one will believe me, so you're confident in telling me this without worrying that I'll spread it?"

Great Zhou King felt awkward. The way Su Yu put it, it sounded like he spoke 99 falsehoods for every truth, not nine!

However, Su Yu didn't continue to nitpick. Instead, he felt a bit heavy-hearted and nodded, "Forget it, I won't argue with you! I understand the situation with the Human Emperor. It's normal for you, as the head of the secret guards, not to dare to invest your power on my side. The Human Emperor might indeed need someone to guard him... As for where his true body is, I won't bother asking!"

Some things are better left unasked.

Great Zhou King breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he had guessed that Su Yu wouldn't ask too many details.

Su Yu chuckled, "No wonder you're so agreeable, giving territory when asked, lending strength when needed, agreeing to revoke titles so readily! You probably think you're about to die, and now there's an opener, so why not offer some benefits to pull me onto the chariot?"

Su Yu sneered, "I knew it, the people around the Culture King are all no good! Just like you, all old and cunning!"

Great Zhou King awkwardly said, "The Human Emperor doesn't have such intentions. He is inherently kind..."

"Heh!"

Su Yu sneered, "Don't kid yourself. No matter how kind he is, he's still an emperor, not an idiot! What if he ends up nurturing a rival? Right now, it's just a desperate measure!"

He roughly understood the Human Emperor's thoughts.

But he still felt heavy-hearted.

The Human Emperor was gravely injured and dying, yet he was forcibly pretending that everything was fine, or at least not too serious. If the myriad races knew about this, a shocking battle would likely erupt in the upper reaches!

Great Zhou King had kept this secret tightly, and perhaps he was the only one who knew.

Now, he was intentionally or unintentionally telling Su Yu, probably thinking that Su Yu might really go to the upper reaches and was giving him a heads-up!

Don't expect too much from the Human Emperor, because right now, he's just an empty shell!

"Just after a great victory, and now receiving bad news, you really are... a buzzkill!"

Su Yu pursed his lips, not wanting to say more.

And Great Zhou King, feeling quite innocent, thought, It's not me being a buzzkill, it's you who insisted on asking today, I had no choice.

Well!

He had kept this secret for too long, not daring to reveal it to anyone. Su Yu, this madman, was indeed crazy. Knowing this, he still acted as if nothing had happened. If it were any other Human Lord, they would probably be scared out of their wits!

The Human Emperor is about to die, which would be a shocking test for any Human Lord, but Su Yu is unfazed.

Great Zhou King couldn't help but admire him. Even madness has its advantages.

Normal people would be afraid, but Su Yu wouldn't.

Indeed, I guessed right, Su Yu will only be more motivated.

And Su Yu, with a wave of his hand, appeared before everyone with Great Zhou King. Seeing everyone looking over, Su Yu smiled, "Great Zhou King says the Human Emperor is about to die and wants me to quickly ascend the throne as the new Human Emperor. Do you all support me?"

"......"

Silence reigned, as everyone looked at each other helplessly.

Another blatant lie!

Forget it, let's just humor him. Everyone raised their voices and shouted, "Support! Long live Your Majesty!"

Flattering doesn't cost anything, so why not say it!

And Great Zhou King, almost scared to death by Su Yu, looked at everyone's reaction... and was speechless. Forget it, it's even more impressive than I thought, not a single person believes it!

Su Yu also laughed heartily, "That's good. When I see the Human Emperor, I'll have him call me boss. If he doesn't listen, we'll beat him up together!"

"Beat up the Human Emperor!"

Someone shouted, but not many echoed. The one who shouted, King Miecan, turned pale. What, I was just flattering!

Earlier, when I said Su Yu was bad, no one responded.

Now Su Yu says to beat up the Human Emperor, I... I just responded, no need to look at me like that!

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Good, King Miecan, well done. If we meet the Human Emperor, you'll be the first to go! Alright, that's it, everyone go back home, cultivate well, and recover!"

With a wave of his hand, the world dissipated, and everyone left.

Su Yu glanced at everyone, shook his head, and looked at Great Zhou King, "Next time I say the Human Emperor is about to die, do you think when the Human Emperor actually dies, everyone will suspect we're just putting on a show?"

"......"

That's possible!

Great Zhou King didn't know what to say, except that Su Yu is impressive!
