Chapter 694: The Arrival of the New Yu Era

The Four Great Realms were successfully captured.

The Iron Devourer Race was tasked with guarding the Phoenix Race, the Hou Race with the Ape Race, and the Ancient Spatial Beast Race with the Kunpeng.

As for the Dragon Race, Heavenly Dragon Hou’s strength was not weak. Even if his physical body had been shattered, he couldn’t be casually handed over to just anyone for safekeeping. Keeping him in the Human Realm was also inappropriate, as the Human Realm lacked the suppressive power, making incidents too likely.

As for killing him, that couldn’t be done yet.

Su Yu still needed these fellows to help him cultivate the Dragon Dao.

After much consideration, Su Yu decided to send the Dragon Race to the Culture King’s Residence and have the White Dog watch over them.

Even if Heavenly Dragon Hou recovered to his peak, he would still be eaten by the White Dog.

After annihilating the Four Great Realms, Su Yu seized many Senatorial Tokens. Coupled with the Senatorial Tokens offered by the Iron Devourer Race and other races, Su Yu now had over thirty Senatorial Tokens in his possession.

As for why he didn’t entrust the Dragon Race to the two God Devourer Race members… he was simply afraid that they would disappear within a few days of being handed over.

Compared to Doubao and the others, the White Dog was more reliable.

***

Human Realm.

Su Yu returned once more. This time, Great Zhou King, Wan Tiansheng, and Great Ming King also came back with him.

The moment they returned to the Human Realm, Wan Tiansheng said, “Didn’t we send people to hunt down Duobao and the others earlier? Duobao ran fast, but we did have a brief encounter. That fellow said he wanted to defect to the human race and stop aiding evil. What do you think?”

“Duobao?”

Su Yu snorted coldly. “He’s someone who won’t shed tears until he sees his coffin! Tell him to kill Jiantian Hou as a pledge of allegiance. Not just anyone can defect!”

Wan Tiansheng was speechless. This was probably hopeless.

Duobao had only recently reached Daofuse and couldn’t possibly contend with Jiantian Hou.

Su Yu didn’t continue the topic and quickly said, “Principal Wan, you and Great Zhou King have only one task recently: to enhance the human race’s strength and continuously produce Eternals! The Three Body Method is enough. There’s no need for them to be too strong in combat; the more, the better!”

Wan Tiansheng pondered this, and Great Zhou King mused, “No need to walk other Daos?”

Su Yu glanced at him and said, “No need. The more Eternals, the better! Once I take care of Hundred Battle King, and the Great Dao opens, perhaps seven or eight Daofuse experts will emerge instantly. Why bother walking other Daos? This will also weaken Hundred Battle King!”

“…”

They were speechless.

Great Zhou King gave a wry smile. Su Yu also smiled and said, “Additionally, Zhao Chuan and the others, speed up your actions over there. First, find and seal off the passage!”

Su Yu chuckled. “The human race will enter a period of development and tranquility soon. Don’t delay the conquest of Minor Realms, but ignore the three major races! We’re not aiming for an increase in the number of Daofuse experts, but we must have more Eternals! With enough vessels and resources, simply fusing with the physical body Dao is the simplest method of enlightenment and the easiest Great Dao to achieve. There’s no reason, with the resources of the Myriad Realms, not to produce Eternals! I wouldn’t dare say too many, but thirty to fifty should be possible, right?”

“I refuse to believe that after hundreds of years of accumulation, the human race doesn’t have thirty to fifty geniuses with the potential to enter Eternal!”

Great Zhou King nodded. “There certainly are. As long as we’re willing to provide vessels and they use the Three Body Method to achieve enlightenment, and with the myriad races not daring to obstruct us now, producing dozens of Eternals isn’t difficult. I’m just worried about future advancement.”

“That’s a problem for later!”

Su Yu didn’t care much. Having more Eternals was enough; at least they would be able to use the power of laws.

Great Zhou King found it difficult to say more. Su Yu then added, “As for the veteran Eternals, they should still focus on reaching Daofuse! Great Han King and the others are all aiming for Daofuse. Those who walked the physical body Dao and haven’t changed their path must also quickly reach Eternal Ninth-stage! Strive to advance to Daofuse as soon as Hundred Battle King dies!”

“You’re treating him as an imaginary enemy?”

Great Zhou King smiled wryly. Su Yu nodded. “Something like that! If he’s disobedient, I’ll find a way to kill him. The human race can gain at least seven or eight Daofuse experts. I have a feeling!”

Great Zhou King sighed helplessly and said no more.

Wan Tiansheng smiled. “What about you then?”

“Me?”

Su Yu chuckled. “I need to improve myself. We’ve taken down the Four Great Realms. Jiantian Hou and Duobao can wait; no rush! But we need to put pressure on them, occasionally launching encirclement campaigns! Lest the myriad races think we’ve done nothing! Don’t give them a chance to enter the Allheaven Battlefield!”

“Alright!”

“Oh, and one more thing. Besides the three major races, other Minor Realms, including some ancient races without Daofuse experts, might have Senatorial Tokens. When you’re conquering, if you find any Senatorial Tokens, hand them all over to me!”

“Understood!”

***

Su Yu said no more. He had to make a trip to the Culture King’s Residence first.

After that, Su Yu planned to travel through the Myriad Realms.

He would plant all his Book of Time pages, like seeds.

Then, he would wait for the Myriad Realms to help him cultivate his Dao!

This was even more potent than absorbing the blood essence of the myriad races. He wanted the myriad races to unknowingly help him cultivate his Dao, and to cultivate it powerfully.

Then, he would reclaim these Daos and merge them into his Mark of Civilization.

After that, he would consider whether to absorb the Book of Time as well.

If successful, Su Yu, wielding the Mark of Civilization, might be able to use these stolen powers to forge his own independent Dao, perhaps even bypassing the River of Time and creating a Dao separate from it, much like the Dao of Death.

He had to avoid the River of Time!

Lest it cause trouble.

Of course, Su Yu would continue to comprehend and master the pen dao. The Mark of Civilization was his trump card.

Should anything unexpected occur, and someone gain control of his pen dao, heh… he could still unleash even greater power without using the pen dao.

At this moment, Su Yu was already preparing for the unforeseen.

He had to cultivate the pen dao.

From now on, it would be best to treat it as his alternate identity, simply a powerful pen dao expert.

As long as there were no changes in the River of Time, Su Yu would be the sole master of this Dao.

Should anything unexpected occur, he would be a master of his own self-forged Dao.

As a scholar, if he didn’t leave himself a fallback, could he still be called a scholar?

He even considered the Culture King as an imaginary enemy. If the Culture King could still control the pen dao and suddenly withdraw its power from him, what would he do?

If he could treat others as fish to be farmed, then Su Yu worried that others might treat him the same way.

As something that could be harvested at any time!

***

Culture King’s Residence.

As Su Yu entered, he laughed heartily. “Fatty, I’ve brought you a gift!”

As his words fell, a group of giant dragons was thrown out by him.

At this moment, Heavenly Dragon Hou, having recovered a frail physical body, looked at this place with a hint of horror in his eyes.

A house within the River of Time!

The Culture King’s territory?

Fatty quickly ran out. Seeing these dragons, he had a headache. “Should I roast them? There are too many!”

Heavenly Dragon Hou’s face was grim.

Su Yu chuckled. “No roasting. For now, we’ll imprison them here. There’s really nowhere else to keep them! If I kept them in the God Devourer Realm, I’m afraid Maoqiu’s parents would eat them all very quickly!”

From afar, Maoqiu also flew over, sniffed, and said with dissatisfaction, “No Tiangu Incense, not tasty!”

Su Yu was speechless. Can you even eat it?

And you’re being picky!

This little fellow’s aura had grown stronger recently, showing faint signs of reaching the peak of Sunmoon Realm. Had it found its own Dao?

Or was it forcibly enhanced by eating too many good things?

Fatty was also speechless, but quickly said, “That’s fine, but they must be locked up. Otherwise, I’m afraid they’ll damage my flowers. Little Master built an underground prison before, which would be perfect for them. Little Master used to catch some food and keep it there too.”

At this moment
