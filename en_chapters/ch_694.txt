Chapter 694: Arrival of the New Yu (Please Subscribe)

The Four Kings’ Domains were successfully conquered.

The Iron Devourer Race was tasked with overseeing the Phoenix Realm, the Hou Race with the Ape Realm, and the Space Ancient Beast Race with the Kunpeng. As for the Dragon Realm, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis was not weak. Even though his physical body had been destroyed, it was not suitable to leave him under just anyone's watch, nor was it appropriate to place him in the Human Realm, where there was no suppression force, making it too easy for incidents to occur.

As for killing him, that was not an option for now. Su Yu still hoped these beings could help him cultivate the Dragon Dao.

After much consideration, Su Yu decided to send the Dragon Race to the Culture King's Residence, under the watch of the White Dog. Even if the Heavenly Dragon Marquis returned to his peak, he would still be at the mercy of the White Dog.

Having destroyed the Four Kings’ Domains, Su Yu acquired numerous councilor tokens. With additional tokens offered by the Iron Devourer Race, Su Yu now held over thirty councilor tokens.

As for why he didn’t entrust the Dragon Race to the Devourer Race, it was simply because he feared that within a few days, they would vanish without a trace. Compared to Doubao and the others, the White Dog was more reliable.

...

Human Realm.

Su Yu returned once more, this time accompanied by the Great Zhou King, Wan Tiansheng, and the Great Ming King.

Upon their return to the Human Realm, Wan Tiansheng remarked, “Weren’t we supposed to hunt down Duobao and his group? Duobao managed to escape quickly, but we did encounter him briefly. He claimed he wants to join the Human Race and no longer aid the wicked. What do you think?”

“Duobao?” Su Yu snorted coldly. “A man who won’t cry until he sees the coffin! Tell him to kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis as a pledge of allegiance. Not just anyone can join us!”

Wan Tiansheng was speechless; that was likely impossible. Duobao had only recently reached Daofuse and couldn’t possibly match the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

Su Yu didn’t dwell on the topic and quickly said, “Director Wan, you and the Great Zhou King have no other tasks for now. Your sole mission is to enhance the strength of the Human Race, continuously producing Eternals! The Three Body Method will suffice; we don’t need overwhelming combat power, just as many as possible!”

Wan Tiansheng seemed thoughtful, while the Great Zhou King pondered, “No need to follow his path?”

Su Yu glanced at him and replied, “No need. The more Eternals, the better! Once I take down the Hundred Battle King and the Great Dao opens, perhaps seven or eight Daofuse experts will emerge instantly. Why bother with his path? Besides, it weakens the Hundred Battle King!”

“...”

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, and Su Yu continued, “Also, Zhao Chuan and the others need to speed up their actions. Find the passage first and seal it!”

Su Yu chuckled, “In the coming period, the Human Race will experience a phase of development and peace. Don’t let the small races’ wars delay us. Ignore the Three Great Races! We’re not aiming to increase the number of Daofuse experts, but we must increase the number of Eternals! With sufficient carriers and resources, simply merging with the physical Dao is the easiest path to proving the Dao. There’s no reason why, with the resources of the Myriad Realms, we can’t produce Eternals! I dare say, we should have at least thirty to fifty!”

“I refuse to believe that after hundreds of years of accumulation, the Human Race doesn’t have thirty to fifty geniuses capable of stepping into the Eternal realm.”

The Great Zhou King nodded, “There are certainly some. As long as we’re willing to use carriers, proving the Dao with the Three Body Method is feasible. The Myriad Races won’t dare to obstruct us now. Producing dozens of Eternals isn’t difficult, though future advancements might be.”

“That’s a problem for the future!”

Su Yu wasn’t too concerned. Producing more Eternals was enough for now; at least they could wield the power of laws.

The Great Zhou King had nothing more to say, and Su Yu added, “The veteran Eternals should still focus on Daofuse! The Great Han King and others should prioritize Daofuse, and those who haven’t switched paths should quickly reach the ninth stage of the Eternal realm! Strive to advance to Daofuse as soon as the Hundred Battle King falls!”

“Are you treating him as an imaginary enemy?”

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, and Su Yu nodded, “In a way! If he doesn’t cooperate, we’ll find a way to eliminate him. The Human Race could gain at least seven or eight Daofuse experts, I feel it!”

The Great Zhou King was helpless but said no more.

Wan Tiansheng laughed, “What about you next?”

“Me?” Su Yu smiled, “I need to improve myself. Having conquered the Four Kings’ Domains, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao can wait. But we need to keep the pressure on them, occasionally surrounding them! We can’t let the Myriad Races think we’re doing nothing! Don’t give them a chance to enter the Allheaven Battlefield!”

“Alright!”

“Oh, and one more thing. Besides the Three Great Races, other small races, including some ancient races without Daofuse experts, might have councilor tokens. During battles, if you find any, hand them over to me!”

“Understood!”

...

Su Yu said no more. He needed to visit the Culture King's Residence first.

Afterward, Su Yu planned to traverse the Myriad Realms, planting his book page seeds everywhere.

Then, he would wait for the Myriad Realms to help him cultivate his Dao!

This was more potent than absorbing the blood essence of the Myriad Races. He wanted the Myriad Races to unknowingly help him cultivate his Dao, making it formidable.

When the time came, he would reclaim these Daos and merge them into the Mark of Civilization.

Then, he would consider whether to absorb the Book of Time as well.

If successful, there was no guarantee, but with the Mark of Civilization, Su Yu might use the stolen power to open his own Dao, possibly even bypassing the River of Time and creating a separate Dao like the Death Dao.

He needed to avoid the River of Time!

To prevent any trouble.

Of course, Su Yu would continue to comprehend and master the pen dao, keeping the Mark of Civilization as a trump card.

If any changes occurred, and someone controlled his pen dao, well... he wouldn’t need the pen dao to unleash even greater power.

At this moment, Su Yu was already preparing for the unexpected.

He had to cultivate the pen dao.

From now on, it was best to treat it as his alias, a pure pen dao expert.

As long as the River of Time remained unchanged, Su Yu would be a unique Dao expert.

If any changes occurred, he would be an expert who opened his own Dao.

As a scholar, if he didn’t leave himself a way out, could he still call himself a scholar?

He even considered the Culture King as an imaginary enemy. If the Culture King could still control the pen dao and withdrew his pen dao power, what would he do then?

If he could treat others as fish to be raised, Su Yu worried that others might treat him the same way, ready to harvest at any time!

...

Culture King's Residence.

As Su Yu entered, he laughed heartily, “Senior White Dog, I’ve brought you a gift!”

With those words, he released a group of giant dragons.

At this moment, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, having regained a frail physical form, was shocked upon seeing this place.

A house in the River of Time!

The Culture King's domain?

The White Dog quickly emerged, looking at the dragons with some headache, “Are we roasting them? There are too many!”

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis wore a grim expression.

Su Yu chuckled, “No roasting, just temporarily imprison them here. There’s really no other place to keep them! If I leave them in the Devourer Realm, I fear Maoqiu’s parents will soon devour them!”

In the distance, Maoqiu also flew over, sniffing and expressing dissatisfaction, “No Tiangu scent, not tasty!”

Su Yu was speechless. Could you even eat them?

And you’re being picky!

This little fellow had recently grown stronger, seemingly on the verge of reaching the peak of the Sunmoon Realm. Had it found its own Dao? Or had it simply consumed too many good things, forcibly enhancing its strength?

The White Dog was also speechless but quickly said, “That’s fine, but they must be confined. Otherwise, I fear they’ll damage my flowers. The young master once built an underground cage, which can be used to confine them. The young master used to capture some food and keep it there.”

At this moment, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis couldn’t hold back any longer and said in a low voice, “Su Yu, either kill me or stop humiliating me!”

Capturing food and keeping it in the basement?

What do you take me for!

Su Yu smiled, while the White Dog was surprised, “What’s wrong? Isn’t it okay? That place is great for keeping dragons. I remember many years ago, the young master captured a dragon named Longji and kept it there. He didn’t complain.”

“Longji?”

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis was stunned, his expression shifting. After a long pause, he said in a deep voice, “Your young master... the Time Sage?”

“Yes.”

“The Time Sage... and the Culture King are indeed one!”

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis gritted his teeth. As expected!

Longji, a top-tier expert of the Dragon Race, was powerful. By today’s standards, he was a Heavenly King-level existence.

In the end, he was taken by the Time Sage and never heard from again, later perishing.

So, he was captured and brought here.

“The master is the master, the young master is the young master, they’re not the same person!”

The White Dog explained, not caring whether the Heavenly Dragon Marquis listened or not.

At this moment, the White Dog wasn’t interested in dealing with them and only wanted to find Su Yu to retrieve its little stone before Su Yu realized its value.

“Big Tree, take them to the basement!”

“Okay!”

In the courtyard, the big tree extended numerous branches, grabbing the Dragon Race experts. Su Yu smiled, “Heavenly Dragon Marquis, rest and recover your physical form. As long as your Dragon Race behaves, I won’t harm you!”

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis remained silent.

The Dragon Realm had already fallen to Su Yu. Struggling was futile; he could only wait for an opportunity to rise again.

Soon, the big tree’s branches locked them up and swiftly moved them to the basement in the backyard.

Su Yu didn’t care. In this place, if the Heavenly Dragon Marquis could escape, he’d be truly impressive.

The Time Waterfall made it impossible for him to leave.

If he tried to traverse the River of Time, this segment was sealed, even severed. It would be a miracle if he could escape.

...

After the dragons were taken away, the White Dog feigned calmness and said, “Su Yu, the little stone you took last time, you haven’t used it. Give it back to me. The furniture in the master’s house is broken, and I need the stone to prop it up.”

“Fragrant...”

“Big Tree!”

The big tree wrapped around Maoqiu, muttering, “Time to study! It’s time!”

“I don’t want to...”

It was useless to refuse. Soon, Maoqiu, filled with grief and indignation, was still taken away to study.

Su Yu chuckled, “Taking the stone didn’t cause any problems, right?”

“No...”

“Then I’ll keep using it for now!”

Su Yu smiled, “This stone is a treasure with the effect of suppressing rules. If you urgently need it, I’ll give it to you. If not, I’ll keep using it.”

Chapter 1: The White Dog's Dilemma

The White Dog looked dejected. "You already know there's a benefit?"

It sighed, "I don't have to use it, but if you don't give it to me, I can't easily leave. The master's house has been here for too long; it's about to collapse! That stone can help stabilize it. Right now, I can still keep it steady, but if I leave, it won't hold. The Big Wood alone can't keep it stable."

This house was the White Dog's spiritual anchor.

Su Yu pondered for a moment and said, "I'll use it for now. If you need to go out, I'll use this to suppress it! If it doesn't work, we'll wait until the Human Race's fortune improves, and I'll use the Human Lord Seal to suppress it for a while."

The Human Lord Seal was now a divine weapon. Although its attack power wasn't strong, it was effective for suppressing fortune and rules, somewhat similar to the little stone.

"Alright then!"

The White Dog had no objections this time. It glanced at Su Yu, sniffed him, and remarked curiously, "You have a lot of different scents on you."

Su Yu nodded. "Yes, I'm contemplating my own path."

He continued with a smile, "Fat Ball, let me ask you something. Why did the Culture King separate his pen dao in his later years instead of strengthening his own great dao?"

"I don't know."

The White Dog shook its head. "I rarely ask about these unimportant matters."

"Unimportant?"

"Yes!" The White Dog nodded. "What's more important is what to eat for lunch, dinner, and when to go home."

Alright, you win!

Su Yu didn't mind. He was just asking out of curiosity, and it didn't matter if he didn't get an answer.

After some thought, Su Yu said, "There's another matter I need to discuss with you."

"What is it?"

The White Dog looked at him curiously, wondering what could require a discussion.

Su Yu thought for a moment before saying, "It's about the Book of Time! It's your little master's book, and it's currently with me."

The White Dog nodded, aware of the situation.

Su Yu continued, "I want to forge my own path, but it requires a lot of time and effort! The Book of Time is already a semi-finished product and quite powerful, but I don't want to spend too much time on it. So, if my path takes shape, I want to merge the Book of Time into my Mark of Civilization."

Su Yu said seriously, "The Book of Time was crafted by the Time Sage over countless years! It's actually much stronger than my Mark of Civilization right now, but ultimately, it's not mine, nor is it my path. There's still a difference!"

"I want to forge my own weapon of proof, so I want to merge this book into my Mark of Civilization. Do you think that's okay?"

The White Dog stared at him for a long time before saying, "You... without this, can you still find the little master and the others?"

"Probably. The Time Sage left a tear, which serves as a coordinate!"

Su Yu explained, "The Book of Time is also a coordinate, but merging it won't affect that."

"As long as you can find the little master and the others, then merge it."

The White Dog didn't have much of an opinion. "The book isn't important; the people are! The little master discarded the book and doesn't use it anymore! If you can improve yourself, then merge it, as long as you can find the people."

Su Yu smiled, "Fat Ball, you're quite understanding."

Fat Ball bared its teeth and wagged its tail. "Of course, books aren't as important as people! If you become stronger, you can find the little master sooner and faster."

"Wise!"

Su Yu gave a thumbs-up, praising it.

He laughed, "Alright, with your approval, I'm relieved. Once my Mark of Civilization takes shape, I'll find a way to extract the Book of Time and merge it."

If Fat Ball hadn't agreed, Su Yu would have had to reconsider. After all, it had helped him a lot. Even though his forces were stronger now, and Fat Ball had only intervened once, he still had to consider its attitude.

With the Book of Time, Su Yu could save himself countless hours. The Time Sage had forged it over countless years, and the virtual daos within were not weak. They would inevitably overlap with Su Yu's Mark of Civilization, allowing for mutual integration.

As for those that didn't overlap, they were likely from some extinct ancient races. Given their extinction, there was probably no one left to claim those daos, so he might be able to directly seize the power of those daos. After all, there were no people left.

Over the years, it's likely that no one has taken charge or merged with those daos.

Seeing Su Yu deep in thought, Fat Ball wagged its tail and asked when Su Yu returned to his senses, "The Big Wood has gained intelligence. Do you need it to help you?"

"Not for now."

Su Yu smiled. "We have enough people for now! Is the Big Wood powerful?"

"It's quite powerful, stronger than the Book Spirit and Tea Plant!"

Su Yu nodded. That was good. The tree had existed for a long time, even longer than the White Dog. Now that it had gained intelligence, its combat power wasn't weak.

According to Su Yu's classification, the Book Spirit and Tea Plant were around the fourth tier. The Big Wood was stronger, possibly possessing third-tier Daofuse strength.

After chatting with Fat Ball for a bit, Su Yu stood up and said, "I'll be off then. I still need to prepare for opening my path! It's quite troublesome."

"Mm!"

Fat Ball watched Su Yu leave, feeling a bit down. Su Yu was going to merge the Book of Time, which made it a little sad. But thinking about how Su Yu was doing it to strengthen himself and find the little master and the others, it came to terms with it.

If Su Yu wasn't strong, finding them would be pointless. The little master and the others were very powerful, and even they were in danger. If Su Yu went now and found them, he'd be blown away with a single breath.

...

Emperor Yu's Mansion.

Weapon Forging Department.

In front of Su Yu lay over a thousand pages. At this moment, Zhao Li and the others looked exhausted.

It hadn't been long since Su Yu gave the order, and they had already forged over a thousand pages, an enormous amount.

All were at the Earth Weapon level!

"Thank you for your hard work, Teacher!"

Su Yu smiled at Zhao Li, who returned the smile, "It's nothing, just Earth Weapons. It's a bit tedious, that's all."

It hadn't been long since the last order.

Su Yu chuckled and quickly turned to the Heavenly Casting King and the others, saying, "The rest need to be forged with overtime!"

Su Yu was quite serious. "The Human Race is now waging war across the Myriad Realms. We can recruit weapon forgers from the myriad races. As long as we ensure they don't play any tricks, there won't be a problem! Speed up the forging; there aren't many Human Race forgers, but there are plenty among the myriad races!"

The Heavenly Casting King nodded, tired. "Alright! I'll have Xia Longwu capture some forgers and bring them back."

He then smiled, "I've advanced!"

"Divine Weapon Forger?"

"No, seventh stage!"

The Heavenly Casting King was delighted. "Eternal Seventh Stage!"

"Oh, congratulations!"

Su Yu replied perfunctorily.

Seventh stage, I thought you had reached Daofuse.

What's the use of the seventh stage?

The Heavenly Casting King felt weary. This arrogant guy, I'm already at the seventh stage, okay? Recently, while forging weapons, he hadn't been without gains. Now, it was harvest time. He had switched daos and stepped onto the weapon forging dao.

Now, he had quickly reached the seventh stage, and perhaps he really had a chance at Daofuse!

Zhao Li and Zhao Tianbing were still at the Sunmoon Realm, with Zhao Tianbing at the peak of the Sunmoon Realm and Zhao Li at the sixth level of the Sunmoon Realm, still some distance from proving the dao.

These days, they had been tirelessly forging weapons, and both had made significant gains.

Su Yu hadn't helped them much, unless they reached the point of advancing, then he would lend a hand.

He hadn't shown much favoritism to his teachers, like Liu Wenyan and the others.

Their strength was still at the Sunmoon stage.

Bai Feng was still at the Mountainsea stage.

With greater strength came more tasks and dangers. Su Yu preferred that they not participate in the great battles if possible. In the event of a major war, the Eternals would definitely have to join the fight.

Zhao Li and the others didn't say much, and Su Yu wasn't sure what they were thinking.

Having obtained over a thousand pages, Su Yu smiled.

For now, it's enough!

The myriad races, though called myriad, were not that many after the opening of the heavens. Many races had perished.

Over a thousand pages, if not enough, more could be forged later.

"I'll first merge these into my Mark of Civilization, and more can be forged later..."

Su Yu said, taking out the Mark of Civilization, which was missing a few pages, but it didn't affect the whole.

Soon, one blank page after another was forged into the Mark of Civilization.

The main structure had long been completed, so integrating them wasn't difficult.

Su Yu could complete the forging alone.

As these pages were continuously integrated into the Mark of Civilization, it grew stronger.

Golden patterns increased one by one.

Originally on the verge of breaking into the divine weapon stage, when Su Yu integrated the eight-hundredth page, a thunderous sound erupted, and the Mark of Civilization finally broke through the barrier, advancing more difficultly than the Human Lord Seal.

A divine weapon!

145 solid golden patterns, though the virtual patterns had long been frighteningly numerous!

It officially stepped into the divine weapon stage!

With the Mark of Civilization entering the divine weapon stage, instead of a reward, a tribulation descended. However, Su Yu didn't resist it, quickly making a trip to the Culture King's Residence.

The White Dog hadn't even seen clearly before Su Yu disappeared in a blink.

Avoiding the punishment of the rules!

In the past, Su Yu would have taken advantage of it, but now he refrained, fearing that excessive exploitation would lead to the premature opening of the Upper Realm's gate, which would be counterproductive.

...

This time, the weapon forging took quite a bit of time.

It took a full seven days for Su Yu to forge all the pages into the Mark of Civilization, totaling 1,480 pages.

The golden patterns reached 155.

Of course, a divine weapon is a divine weapon, but it wasn't yet stronger than the Hunting Heaven List. The Hunting Heaven List, when briefly gathered last time, had vaguely reached 170 or 180 golden patterns.

The fusion wasn't the end but just the beginning.

Soon, Su Yu spent a large amount of treasures, even treasures at the carrier level, to integrate into those new pages.

Su Yu began transcribing a multitude of cultivation techniques and racial abilities from various races, recording them meticulously. Not only that, but the corpses of powerful beings slain in the Allheaven Battlefield were continuously transported back, only to be devoured by Su Yu's Mark of Civilization. Although he no longer relied on devouring the myriad races to enhance the Mark, it would be wasteful not to consume them once they were killed. First, he would construct a rudimentary form of the virtual dao on the pages.

This time, Su Yu's stay at the Luminous Domain Mansion was the longest yet. In the blink of an eye, the year 352 of the Anping Calendar was nearing its end. Soon, it would be the year 353, which would henceforth be known as the New Yu Calendar.

...

A new year heralds new beginnings!

The Anping Calendar was witnessing its final moments. This year, the Human Race achieved a grand victory, their name resounding across the Myriad Realms. Celebrations were organized throughout the Human Realm to welcome the new calendar and the first year of the New Yu Calendar. Every prefecture was immersed in festivity.

The various races of gods and demons sealed their realms, while the Human Race swept across the Myriad Realms, subduing or annihilating those who resisted. Countless resources were transported back to the Human Realm, leading to the rapid rise of numerous human geniuses.

In the battles of the small realms, Xia Longwu and his peers were not in a hurry to deploy large armies. Instead, they sent young talents to conquer those small realms that refused to submit or needed to be destroyed. Xia Longwu and Qin Zhen themselves had carved their paths with their own hands and weapons, and they did not wish for the younger generation to simply reap the benefits without effort.

Even Qin Fang and Xia Huyou were dispatched to the Allheaven Battlefield, continuously participating in the battles of the small realms to hone their skills. However, among the younger generation, the one who shone the brightest was not Qin Fang but Zhou Hao. This fierce warrior, who had opened 360 acupoints, had completed 60 body castings and was still continuing. His combat prowess was formidable. Although he was still at the Skysoar Realm, like Su Yu once was, he could nearly contend with some Sunmoon Realm experts.

Zhou Hao was not alone. Many of Su Yu's contemporaries were also beginning to shine brightly. As long as one had merit and dared to kill, surviving would mean a wealth of resources would be directed their way. The treasures Su Yu once risked his life for, such as the Heaven and Earth Profound Light and the Sunmoon Profound Yellow Liquid, were still hard to obtain, but the difficulty had decreased significantly. As long as one dared to battle across the Myriad Realms, there was hope for rapid ascension.

...

Great Xia Prefecture.

As the new year approached, the atmosphere was lively and bustling. On the front lines of the Allheaven Battlefield, many soldiers returned home for the new year. Even the myriad races breathed a sigh of relief as the Human Race's campaign slowed down. Apart from necessary battles, most conflicts had temporarily ceased.

At this moment, at the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy, the once-glorious academy had gradually declined after Su Yu's departure. When Wan Tiansheng killed numerous Eternal disciples and fled the Human Realm, the academy fell into further decline. However, with Su Yu's rise to prominence, Wan Tiansheng's return, and the emergence of figures like Liu Wenyan, Nan Wujiang, and Yun Chen, the academy was revitalized once more.

The first generation Xia Chen, the third generation Nan Wujiang, the sixth generation Wan Tiansheng, and even Yun Chen were all top-tier experts. Even Lan Tian, who had once defected, was now a figure feared by all.

As the new year approached and with the return of many academy talents, the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy was bustling with activity. Yet, amidst the excitement, there was a sense of tension. Countless students, instructors, and researchers moved with utmost caution, fearful of making any noise.

Early in the morning, news had spread that Su Yu and many powerful figures who had once emerged from the academy might return today, or at least revisit their old haunts. The mention of these familiar names, which struck fear across the Myriad Realms, filled every student with excitement.

The New Yu Calendar! This was Su Yu's creation. The only regret among the students was that when Su Yu was mentioned, those from the Great Ming Prefecture liked to argue that Su Yu belonged to the Great Ming Cultural Research Academy. This was irrefutable, as Su Yu had indeed gone there. Fortunately, today Su Yu was visiting the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy, not the Great Ming Cultural Research Academy.

...

In front of the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy.

Marquis Xia stood tall, accompanied by Xia Huyou, Ji Hong, and other strong or talented individuals from the Great Xia Prefecture. Huang Teng and others were also present, including Zhou Hao, who had recently made a name for himself on the Allheaven Battlefield. There was a mix of excitement and reflection among the crowd.

Who could have imagined that Su Yu would return as the Lord of the Myriad Realms?

After a moment, Marquis Xia spoke in a deep voice, "Silence!"

The murmurs ceased quickly. A beam of light appeared, and Xia Longwu, clad in military attire, swiftly arrived, speaking in a solemn tone, "His Majesty Emperor Yu and Chief Wan will be arriving soon! Remember, their visit to the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy is purely for reminiscing. Do not bring up anything else!"

Everyone nodded in agreement. Marquis Xia added, "Keep your eyes sharp. I had quite the tussle with Zhu Tiandao next door to bring Emperor Yu here. Don't embarrass me!"

He wasn't exaggerating. He and Zhu Tiandao had nearly come to blows over this. In the end, he won. Zhu Tiandao had no choice, not because he lost to Marquis Xia, but because Wan Tiansheng, Zhao Li, Liu Wenyan, Nan Wujiang, and many other powerful figures hailed from the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy. Even if Su Yu wanted to visit the Great Ming Prefecture, he had to consider whether it was appropriate. After all, Su Yu himself originated from the Great Xia Prefecture, with his roots here.

Everyone was quite serious.

...

However, Su Yu's side was anything but serious. He had just finished forging weapons and was persuaded by the Great Xia King and others, with Zhao Li's support, to return to the Great Xia Prefecture during this transitional period. In truth, Su Yu was more eager to venture into the Myriad Realms. With the Mark of Civilization completed, he was eager to reap its benefits.

Yet, with Wan Tiansheng's persuasion, Su Yu had no choice but to come along. His presence wasn't the main issue; it was Lan Tian! He was also from the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy. Wherever Lan Tian was, there was never a dull moment, and there were always crowds!

Su Yu was on the verge of a breakdown. Not just him, but the Great Xia King and Wan Tiansheng were also at their wits' end. They had had enough! What should have been a simple return trip was turned into a chaotic mess by Lan Tian!

Su Yu watched as Lan Tian's countless avatars busied themselves, even clashing with each other to disperse onlookers who got too close. He couldn't help but ask through a voice transmission, "Principal, has he gone mad?"

Wan Tiansheng was equally speechless and helplessly replied, "No, this guy has been researching how to control over ten thousand avatars simultaneously! It's your fault for suggesting it. Previously, he had many avatars, but not this many. Recently, it's gotten out of hand! He's split over a thousand avatars here, hoping we can help suppress them a bit."

Su Yu felt awkward. He had merely mentioned it in passing, not expecting Lan Tian to actually pursue it. The excessive number of avatars was becoming uncontrollable. Su Yu sighed and said, "If it doesn't work out, I'll take him on a trip through the River of Time. I don't even know what path he's on! From my perspective, his path might be somewhat similar to mine."

Indeed, it was somewhat similar. Su Yu's idea was to reopen the myriad daos, unify them, and create a new path. Lan Tian, on the other hand, was merging myriad races, forming myriad bodies, unifying them, and unifying the myriad daos, which was somewhat akin to Su Yu's approach.

Su Yu was a page in a book, representing a dao. The difference with Lan Tian was that Lan Tian's path involved truly splitting himself, unlike Su Yu, who used book pages as substitutes. Perhaps top-tier geniuses and prodigies were all like this. In the end, their paths might converge.

The unification of the dao!

Currently, Su Yu saw glimpses of this in the Time Sage, Lan Tian, and Wan Tiansheng. As for others, he hadn't seen it yet. What exactly was Lan Tian's path? Su Yu was genuinely curious!

Wan Tiansheng transmitted, "Lan Tian's path is different from yours! I have a general understanding of your ideas. As for Lan Tian, fundamentally, it's not really the myriad daos. He might have some thoughts of merging the myriad daos, but at its core, I believe it's still the path of avatars!"

The path of avatars seemed somewhat low-tier. Of course, that was Su Yu's opinion. In reality, such a path, even if not the unification of the myriad daos, was still quite formidable.

"We'll see later!"

Su Yu smiled and glanced at the little girl beside him, around seven or eight years old, sucking on a lollipop and curiously watching him and Wan Tiansheng. He felt even more helpless. You really are something.

He didn't say much more. Once he helped Lan Tian traverse the River of Time, everything would become clear.

This return to the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy was not driven by any particular agenda for Su Yu. It was simply a chance to gather with old acquaintances, including members of the Mutual Aid Association and teachers who had helped him, such as Elder Nie, Elder Huang, and Wu Yuehua. It was a simple reunion.

In the future, there might not be many opportunities for such gatherings. After this visit, Su Yu might not return for a long time. He had too many things to do, and time was of the essence.

...

On this day, Su Yu didn't meet too many people. He simply hosted a few tables at the former Lan Tian Research Institute, now the Primordial Spirit Research Institute, to entertain some old friends. They toasted, discussed the dao, and spoke freely.

They talked about cultivation, research, and the future.

Su Yu rarely drank. He hadn't reached the point of needing to drown his sorrows in alcohol, so he didn't need it.

Year 711 of the New Yu Calendar.

Today, Su Yu indulged in a heavy drinking session, allowing the alcohol to wash over him without using any source qi to dispel it. Yet, even so, he found it hard to get truly drunk. Through his hazy vision, familiar figures appeared before him.

...

After the feast, the table was left in disarray. Liu Wenyan, slightly tipsy, approached Su Yu, draping an arm over his shoulder, shedding his usual graceful demeanor. Dragging Su Yu to a corner, Liu Wenyan smiled bitterly, "Your teacher here, who has been strong all his life, is actually a coward! I've let down many people, including you!"

"When I first encouraged you to join the Multi-Character Department, I had my own selfish reasons... Some things, I spoke of grandly later, but in truth, I never had the courage to say them outright. When you told me about your dreams of being hunted by the myriad races, I knew you were destined for great opportunities!"

He wasn't a fool; he had long noticed something. Later, he even informed Xia Longwu and the others that Su Yu must have encountered a fortuitous event or even a relic in Nanyuan. He had known this for a while.

"So, I was determined to bring you into the Multi-Character Department, and in the end, you did join as I wished!"

Liu Wenyan sighed, "Now, the situation across the Myriad Realms is promising, but I know the Upper Realm is even more perilous! Every step is fraught with danger, yet I can't help you bear the burden. You're constantly busy, rushing around, surrounded by crises... Perhaps the root of all this lies with me!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Teacher, you're mistaken. Ever since I obtained the Book of Time, I've been caught up in all this. Now, at least my fate is in my own hands. You're overthinking it. I actually see it as a good thing. The Multi-Character Department has spurred my growth; otherwise, I wouldn't be where I am today."

Liu Wenyan smiled wryly, "Perhaps! Since entering the academy, you've been struggling, fighting, battling... And I, for decades, have achieved nothing, enjoying fifty years of peace!"

At this, Liu Wenyan said bitterly, "That's not the point. The point is, you were too influenced by me as a child. Teacher has let you down! I'm not worried about anything else, but I'm concerned that you, boy, might die in battle without ever having been with a woman! Little Yu, my mistake was in leading you astray... Even if you die in battle, I can accept it, but I can't accept you dying without ever holding a woman's hand..."

He winked and said, "This is truly my fault. Why not make a mistake tonight? There are many excellent women here, like Wu Lan, Wu Qi, Xia Chan from the Xia family, Ji Xiaomeng from the Ji family, and your senior sister Wu Jia..."

As he winked, Su Yu turned his head and found the hall extremely quiet, as if everyone was watching them.

Liu Wenyan lowered his voice, "At least leave a bloodline, waiting for a comeback! If you can't do it, and if we survive, we'll support your descendants in the next tide, helping them rise again..."

"Even the Hundred Battle King, that brute, knows to leave some bloodline behind. Are you going to be worse than a brute?"

"..."

Su Yu was speechless. What the heck!

So, this was their plan?

What were they all up to?

I wondered why everyone was pushing drinks on me tonight, urging me not to use source qi to sober up.

What were they thinking!

Women are terrifying, especially with that lunatic Lantian around. Who knows if any of these people are his avatars.

Su Yu shivered!

He immediately said, "No need, I can win. Teacher, just handle your own troubles!"

With that, Su Yu loudly declared, "I've had my fill tonight, but I have important matters to attend to. Everyone, farewell!"

In an instant, Su Yu stepped into the River of Time and vanished from the spot.

The entire hall fell silent.

After a long while, some of the women muttered, "I told you, this guy is a freak who doesn't like women, but you didn't believe me!"

Despite saying this, at that moment, those women who were named felt a bit disappointed.

Even Wu Lan, who seemed indifferent, pouted and said to Bai Feng, "Teacher Bai, he's gone to do research!"

Soon, everyone gradually dispersed, feeling utterly helpless.

The Great Xia King and others shook their heads repeatedly.

They truly wanted Su Yu to leave behind descendants. If this tide ended with Su Yu's defeat and any of them survived, they would still be willing to support Su Yu's descendants, helping them rise to the position of Human Lord again and fight another tide!

Many glared at Liu Wenyan with anger!

Scoundrel!

This was all his doing. Otherwise, with Su Yu's youthful vigor, how could things have turned out like this!

Looking at Lantian again, there was a deep sense of helplessness. These two had scared Su Yu out of his wits, leaving everyone at a loss!

"Disperse, disperse. If there's no next tide, then we'll just fight this one!"

The Great Xia King laughed heartily, downed his drink in one gulp, and smashed the cup, "Emperor Yu's unwillingness to leave behind a bloodline is also to tell everyone to fight this tide alone, with no retreat!"

Everyone gave a thumbs up, agreeing with this interpretation.

They could only think of it this way!

"Gentlemen, fight this tide alone. If the Human Race doesn't win, then we'll be annihilated!"

Everyone drank up, feeling a sense of indescribable helplessness, and gradually dispersed. As for Su Yu, they couldn't count on him to leave behind descendants.

Outside, fireworks lit up the sky.

The first year of the New Yu Calendar had officially begun.
