Chapter 819: Breaking the Seal, Ruler of Laws

For the past few days, Su Yu had been focused on moving the heavens to cover the Human Mountain.

Seven days!

Each day, he dispatched a powerful expert. Every time an expert appeared, the fluctuations in their aura provided the perfect cover for Su Yu to shift the heavens.

As for oppressing the myriad races or forcing them into submission... who had the time for that?

If I charge out with full force, you'll still be trembling in fear.

This strategy had a benefit: moving the heavens caused quite a commotion. But with a Heavenly Venerable appearing, no one would notice the disturbance, or they would simply attribute it to the aura fluctuations of the Heavenly Venerable.

In seven days, Su Yu had successfully moved the heavens above the Human Mountain!

This was a classic case of "stealing the beams and replacing the pillars."

And now, the harvest was here.

The Human Mountain was originally a Chaos Mountain, but it was part of the Human Emperor's domain. Normally, no one could occupy it. However, Su Yu had no such issue, as his main foundation was the Human Lord Seal!

Thus, the Human Emperor ceded the territory to him.

And so, today's scene unfolded.

Su Yu's heavens descended directly, covering the Human Mountain.

In that instant, everyone on Su Yu's side, even those who hadn't merged with the Dao, experienced a surge in power, granted by Su Yu. Meanwhile, the myriad races found their strength instantly diminished.

This was a zero-sum game!

The gap widened instantly!

Su Yu's voice reverberated through the universe, cold and commanding, "Kill! Kill until the myriad races take the initiative to attack, until the Ruler of Laws of the Sin Clan is slain! Slaughter! Slaughter until the myriad races' foundations in the Upper Realm are eradicated! If they don't want the Lower Realm, then they shouldn't have the Upper Realm either! Exterminate the myriad races first!"

Su Yu's voice was cold and boundless.

"Chaos Dragon, Eight-Winged Tiger, if you continue to stall and fish in troubled waters... Great Zhou King, kill them!"

In the heavens, the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger's expressions changed drastically!

This bastard was truly terrifying.

"Kill!"

The two Chaos Ancient Beasts erupted instantly. With a thunderous roar, the Chaos Dragon's tail coiled around the Nether Heavenly Venerable, and in the blink of an eye, the Nether Heavenly Venerable was torn apart!

His physical body was shattered!

His sea of will had just appeared when it was incinerated to ashes by the Chaos Dragon's dragon flame!

Here, everyone was suppressed!

The first Heavenly Venerable was killed almost instantly. The gap was too vast, and the Nether Heavenly Venerable wasn't strong to begin with, not to mention facing the Chaos Dragon while being suppressed!

By now, even the Chaos Dragon knew that if he didn't go all out, Su Yu would find out about his and the Eight-Winged Tiger's half-hearted efforts, and they would die!

They would really die!

At this moment, in the crowd behind, Tiangu felt a sense of relief.

He had guessed it!

He hadn't guessed the specifics, but he had guessed that Su Yu must have been prepared. Indeed, he never intended to lose; everything he did was with preparation!

The Nether Heavenly Venerable was dead!

Not only that, but in the distance, the Desolate Heavenly Venerable roared, but his opponent was the Eight-Winged Tiger, who was also going all out, its eight wings frantically tearing through the void.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was also going all out now!

Su Yu was truly insidious!

He couldn't afford to provoke him!

Even if injured, he had to take down a Heavenly Venerable!

Further away, the Moon Heavenly Venerable and others were being beaten to the point of vomiting blood, constantly being knocked back. A large number of Daofuse cultivators were being rapidly slaughtered. The Great Qin King, a decisive killer, led Xia Longwu and others, charging directly towards the Human Mountain!

Killing everyone in sight!

Massacre!

The Great Qin King's spear danced, and at this moment, with the Heavenly Venerables and Heavenly Kings blocked, no one could match the Great Qin King. One spear, one kill, as Eternal experts charged out in suicidal attacks, only to be instantly slain!

Tiangu's face was filled with sorrow!

Over there, the Divine Empress was actually being held back by the South Heavenly King alone. Not only that, but the South Heavenly King was currently exuding a powerful aura, his Dao manifesting as a whip, lashing the Divine Empress until she was covered in blood!

Defeated!

Utterly defeated!

Cries of despair, pain, and wailing erupted throughout the entire Human Mountain...

Tiangu had already seen it. He saw the Great Xia King leading people towards the Immortal Clan's territory.

The people of the Lower Realm were in Su Yu's hands.

If the Upper Realm's Immortal Clan was exterminated, then the Immortal Clan... would be completely annihilated!

Tiangu suddenly aged significantly, his hair turning gray. For the first time, he felt the threat of annihilation looming before him. They were on the brink of extinction!

In all the battles against Su Yu, they had never gained an advantage!

Not even a little!

Tiangu's back hunched over significantly. I knew... I should have known, but unfortunately, this world is not under my control. I cannot persuade everyone among the myriad races. With a sorrowful expression, he ignored the Heavenly Venerables, ignored the Heavenly Kings...

He turned back and saw the Great Qin King and Great Xia King slaughtering!

These people had fought for five hundred years, killing countless enemies. Why would they care about such things?

This was a war of races!

Any race that lost would face this outcome, and now, the Human Race had won!

Five hundred years ago, the myriad races invaded the Human Realm, causing untold suffering and nearly wiping out all life. A group of founders stood up, accepted the legacy, became Eternals, fought in all directions, and preserved the Human Realm.

For five hundred years, wars had been constant, with countless small battles... too many had died!

The Devil Subduing Army of the Great Xia Prefecture had recalled veterans five times because they had suffered heavy losses in the myriad realms, with countless experts dying in battle.

Manpower was scarce!

It was all very brutal.

Today, a great victory!

The Great Xia King and others were commanding generals, showing no mercy, slaughtering rivers of blood. The Upper Realm's various races, totaling only about fifty million, were being slaughtered in the blink of an eye, leaving corpses strewn everywhere!

Countless people wailed!

Tiangu, with a sorrowful expression, his voice echoing through the heavens, "Our Immortal Clan... surrenders! Emperor Yu, I beseech you to grant our Immortal Clan a path to survival... Tiangu... bows in gratitude to Your Majesty!"

His knees, unable to bend.

For a hundred thousand years after the ancient times, he had led the Immortal Clan, warring against the Human Race for a hundred thousand years, never feeling such despair, such pain as today.

The Immortal Clan, if they continued to fight, would be exterminated!

His knees couldn't bend... but at this moment, he had to bend!

With a thunderous crash, Tiangu knelt on the ground, kowtowing in the direction of Su Yu, "The Emperor of the Immortal Clan, Tiangu, submits! I hope my Emperor... grants my Immortal Clan a path to survival!"

He submitted!

Whether he was willing or not, at this moment, he bowed to this new Human Emperor, something that had never happened in ancient times!

Su Yu's cold voice came, "Go kill the Dragon Consort, kill Yue Zhan, kill Yu Qing! Only those above Daofuse are allowed to go, everyone else, continue the slaughter, slaughter until they kill those people, if they can't, slaughter them all! After killing those, slaughter the myriad races of the Lower Realm!"

At this moment, Su Yu was ruthless beyond measure!

You go kill, if you can't, I'll slaughter all your people, the faster you kill, the more can survive, if you kill slowly... then slaughter them all!

Killing the Ruler of Laws wasn't that simple.

Even with many experts on Su Yu's side, killing the Ruler of Laws could result in heavy losses!

At this moment, borrowing a knife to kill... no, it was snatching a knife to kill!

You must go kill!

If you don't, your race will be exterminated!

Tiangu's face was full of sorrow, and the next moment, he roared fiercely, "Kill! Kill the Sin Clan! Those who don't want to be exterminated, follow me to kill!"

Boom!

A powerful aura erupted, and Tiangu instantly unleashed a powerful aura, vaguely approaching the level of a Heavenly Venerable, even reaching it, roaring as he charged out!

"Don't stop them!"

Su Yu's voice reverberated again, "Let them go, even if they play tricks halfway, it doesn't matter!"

Su Yu remained cold.

Even if these people turned their weapons halfway, so what?

At this point, even if they couldn't completely annihilate the three factions this time, they could severely weaken them, and soon, Su Yu could completely pacify them!

The myriad races... their last chance!

Su Yu hesitated at this moment, whether to completely annihilate the three races or not?

If completely annihilated, he feared the Human Emperor and others wouldn't be able to withstand the myriad races' madness.

But if Tiangu and others really turned their weapons again... Su Yu wouldn't give them any chance to survive!

At this moment, Tiangu, Dao Heavenly Venerable, Sun Corona, Saint Marquis, Divine Empress, and others, all abandoned their opponents, ignoring everything else, quickly charging into the distance, Saint Marquis and Sun Corona's faces full of sorrow.

Perhaps we... should have listened to Tiangu from the start!

In the rear, the slaughter continued.

The people of the Human Race continued to massacre the myriad races.

Tiangu roared fiercely, "Hurry up!"

Faster!

Faster, every second, a large number of people would be slaughtered, they still had to kill Yue Zhan and others, if they couldn't, if they were too slow, once those fifty million people in the rear were slaughtered, Su Yu would slaughter the Lower Realm!

He could do it!

Su Yu was ruthless, black-hearted, everyone knew that!

...

At this moment, Su Yu stood in the void, looking at Hundred Battles who had stopped, and said calmly, "Brother Hundred Battles, you don't seem very bright. Since you know I've opened the heavens, why are you comparing your butt with me, someone who hasn't opened the heavens?"

Hundred Battles' face was icy.

Su Yu was no longer the playful, smiling figure from before, now he was filled with contempt, coldness, disdain, "How many trump cards do you have left? Show them all! Someone like you, even if you cooperate with the Sin Clan, wouldn't have too few means, wouldn't be unprepared against them, is there only Zhou Ji?"

Hundred Battles looked at him coldly, "Do you think... you've won?"

Su Yu laughed, "Many people have said that to me, and in the end... they were right, I really won, thank you!"

The next moment, Su Yu's cold voice rose again, "South Heavenly King, Great Zhou King... go, capture Changqing and the others alive, I want to see them alive, in front of the myriad realms, give them a thousand cuts, dismember them piece by piece, I don't want traitors to die too quickly!"

"Understood!"

A loud shout, and the next moment, five or six supreme experts quickly flew towards Changqing and the others. Changqing and Changmei's group, who had been flying towards the Gate of Hell, suddenly changed their expressions!

South Heavenly King!

Not just the South Heavenly King, but also the Great Zhou King, Lantian, Wan Tiansheng.

When the people of the myriad races went to fight the Prison King lineage, they had no opponents!

At this moment, the situation had completely changed!

Hundred Battles took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and instantly opened them, divine light flashing in his eyes, "You want to beat me, it's not enough!"

Not enough!

That was Hundred Battles' response.

"Kill you, and everything will naturally come to an end!"

Killing Su Yu would bring an end to everything.

"Your world will collapse, and they will all die. Su Yu, you actually let them all merge into your world. This is the path to your own destruction!"

The stronger you become, the faster you will collapse. The core is Su Yu alone! Kill Su Yu, and everything will be over.

He shouted, "Prison Green, Po Long, break free from your opponents and come kill Su Yu!"

Killing Su Yu would end everything, no need to waste more energy.

He shouted again, "Tiangu, they just need to wait a little longer, and everything can end... Do you really want to be Su Yu's pawns? Fools! He doesn't dare to kill you all. If he does, the Human Emperor and the others will surely face the impact of the Myriad Races' rulers of laws!"

These words caused those from the Myriad Races who had rushed out to hesitate slightly.

At that moment, Su Yu waved his hand, and in an instant, more than ten Eternal experts appeared, exploded, and vanished without a trace!

Su Yu's face was cold and indifferent, saying nothing more. The Myriad Races could try if they dared!

These more than ten Eternals were some of the strong ones left in the lower realm by various races, and now, they were easily reduced to dust by Su Yu. His expression was icy as he reached out and grabbed, causing more Eternals to appear in the void, only to be crushed to pieces by his grasp!

Tiangu's eyes turned red as he roared, "Emperor Yu, we did not hesitate... Kill, what are you waiting for, stop Po Long and Prison Green!"

Su Yu was truly ruthless!

Hundred Battle spoke lightly, saying to wait a little longer, but if they waited any longer, Su Yu would kill all the people of the Myriad Races!

Hundred Battle was just standing there talking without feeling the pain!

Su Yu sneered coldly, "Hundred Battle, you are a heartless person, a beast without a race. Do you think the strong ones of the Myriad Races are like you? Although the Myriad Races are enemies of the Human Race, both the Human Race and the Myriad Races fight for their races, not just for survival... Hundred Battle, you don't understand people's hearts. You tell them to wait, and they must be prepared for extinction. You, a heartless beast, dare to compete with me in understanding people's hearts?"

He reached out again, and a large number of Sun and Moon Myriad Races appeared. Su Yu's cold voice rose again, "First kill the Eternals, then the Sun and Moon. Tiangu, the opportunity won't last forever, hurry up, otherwise... soon, you might see all the Sun and Moon fall!"

"Kill!"

Tiangu roared, and the next moment, a group of people rushed into the Chaos Mountain at the fastest speed.

Over there, Po Long Beast bit Wu Ji into two halves, chewing on Wu Ji. At this moment, however, it showed a hint of coldness, looking at the approaching Tiangu and the others, "You..."

Boom!

Just as it opened its mouth, a thunderous explosion sounded!

Dao Heavenly Venerable, with incomparably powerful strength, instantly rushed to its front, self-destructing his great path, his body, everything, and at the last moment, with some sorrow, "Sorry... I'm sorry... Maybe... I should have believed you from the beginning..."

He and Desolate Heavenly Venerable had previously agreed to immediately stop Su Yu, but in just a short while, it led to the current crisis of extinction for the Myriad Races.

It was his fault! All his fault!

Since he chose Tiangu, he should have believed in Tiangu, not doubted.

At this moment, Dao Heavenly Venerable, with a resolute heart, knew that Po Long was difficult to deal with, knew that killing Po Long was hard and would take a long time, and if it took too long, the Myriad Races might be destroyed!

So, in the moment of rushing forward, he had the thought, maybe... I should repent!

"The struggle of the Myriad Races..."

The last image of Dao Heavenly Venerable appeared, with some sorrow, some helplessness, "Actually... isn't it just the struggle of the Human Race? Whether it's the Immortal Race, the God Race, or the Demon Race... actually... they were all one... It's just... like Hundred Battle... a supreme one emerged, and they left the Human Race... In the end, the Human Race is still the strongest..."

This world is still the world of the Human Race.

The struggle of the great paths, not to mention the River of Time, in the Myriad Realms, the Myriad Races were defeated!

Boom!

A violent sound rang out, a top-tier Heavenly Venerable, coming up with a self-destruction, without any hesitation, this time, it shattered much of Po Long's body.

He didn't expect that these people of the Myriad Races, who were timid when fighting Su Yu and his group, would be so decisive when facing him. He was a ruler of laws, Po Long's strength was not weak, even stronger than Prison Green!

Prison Green was considered fourth-class, while Po Long was almost third-class, a top-tier fourth-class expert, close to a weak third-class existence.

However, enduring the self-destruction of a top-tier Heavenly Venerable was no small matter.

In an instant, he was heavily injured.

At this moment, the Consort of the God Emperor roared madly, with a resolute heart, pulling out the hairpin from her head, instantly transforming it into a long sword. Not only that, but in the void, the shadow of the River of Time suddenly appeared!

The Consort of the God Emperor shouted fiercely, raising the long sword to the sky, and in an instant, a powerful force of the great path surged into her long sword!

Drawing upon the power of laws!

The power of the great path was forcibly extracted by her, even to the point of draining the pond to catch the fish, but at this moment, what did she care about that?

She could only gamble, hoping that Su Yu would really keep his promise, that even if they died in battle, he would give the Myriad Races a chance.

The Consort of the God Emperor roared fiercely!

Sun Corona Heavenly Venerable glanced at the Consort of the God Emperor, with some apology, some sorrow, and looked back towards the direction of the Human Mountain, "Consort... if the God Emperor returns... tell him... I... did my best!"

Sun Corona smiled!

The next moment, in the void, a great sun suddenly appeared!

As this great sun appeared, Sun Corona's voice echoed in all directions, "Brother, lend me the power of the moon, the sun and moon illuminate the universe!"

In the distance, Moon Eclipse Heavenly Venerable had not escaped from the Human Mountain, because Su Yu said to kill some, and Moon Eclipse was among those to be killed. At this moment, Moon Eclipse Heavenly Venerable suddenly launched a full-force attack, repelling the Eight-Winged Tiger that wanted to kill him!

He smiled bitterly, "I still don't believe... that we, who have dominated for a hundred thousand years... can be defeated just like that!"

Unbelievable!

But, I know, this is just a fantasy.

The next moment, a bright moon appeared, instantly merging with the great sun in the sky. As the sun and moon merged, a terrifying power surged!

At this moment, this power truly possessed the strength of a ruler of laws!

"Consort... find a safe place for our God Race!"

The giant sun swallowed the bright moon, and in the blink of an eye, the aura became extremely violent, filled with madness, filled with determination. In an instant, actually just after Dao Heavenly Venerable's self-destruction, while Po Long was still roaring, the sun and moon merged, instantly appearing before him!

Po Long's face changed, wanting to escape, but it was too late, because at this moment, the void around him had solidified!

Boom!

A thunderous explosion rang out!

Much stronger than Dao Heavenly Venerable's previous self-destruction!

A blinding light covered all directions, radiating everywhere, causing some weaker ones to close their eyes and scream in pain, while at the center of the light, Po Long let out a miserable scream!

This was equivalent to a ruler of laws self-destructing!

With a loud boom, half of his body was blown to pieces, and at this moment, the Consort of the God Emperor, with blood-red eyes and tears, drew upon the power of the great path with a mad determination, slashing down with a sword!

"Divine Sword Splits the Sky!"

Boom!

The giant sword fell instantly, with a loud boom, this sword shone across the Myriad Realms, splitting the Chaos Mountain.

Silence reigned for a moment!

The Consort of the God Emperor's previously fallen and blackened hair instantly turned completely white, and opposite her, Po Long, who had just been blown apart by Sun Corona and the others, now had a blood mark appearing on his head.

He was filled with disbelief, confusion, and doubt, his huge mouth opening slightly, uttering a bewildered voice, "So strong... why not dare to fight Su Yu?"

He was bewildered!

So fierce, so strong, so powerful, why not go all out against Su Yu's side?

If you really went all out, not to mention destroying Su Yu's side, you could kill five or six Heavenly Venerables on his side!

You are so powerful, you can even kill me, why not dare to kill Su Yu?

We could cooperate!

Sun Corona and Moon Eclipse, two Heavenly Venerables working together, could actually unleash the power of a ruler of laws, and the Consort of the God Emperor was one herself. Since you are not afraid of death, why still listen to Su Yu?

This, he couldn't understand!

Tiangu and the others remained silent.

Why?

Because... Su Yu, you never know what other tricks he has up his sleeve, because you never know where Su Yu is waiting for you, but you, everything about you is out in the open!

Killing you is hopeful, killing Su Yu... might only bring despair!

Po Long Beast gradually cracked, shattered, with some unwillingness, and soon, with some fierceness, "You kill me here... more Chaos Ancient Clan will appear... they... are about to come out!"

Killing him here, all the power was being devoured, being swallowed by the Gate of Hell!

Summoning those behind the Gate of Hell!

Moreover, it wasn't just him who died, there were also Sun Corona, Dao Heavenly Venerable, and many strong ones...

More strong ones will come out!

Here, the distance to the Gate of Hell is not far.

And at this moment, Su Yu's cold voice echoed, "I hope a few more come out, otherwise... I will be disappointed! I could have covered this area with my world, devouring everything of yours, but I didn't... you are always so foolish! If not more come out, how can I perfect my world? One or two, how could that be enough?"

Su Yu's icy voice sent a shock through Po Long Beast's heart.

"You..."

Su Yu had ambition, great ambition!

He wanted to attract more ancient clans to appear!

Let them become the nourishment for his world, now he was not stopping the Gate of Hell from absorbing these, because the number was too few now, Su Yu wanted more rulers of laws!

"Well done!"

Su Yu's laughter echoed, and the next moment, Su Yu's voice was like a great bell, "Monitor Heaven, it's time to be conscious!"

Su Yu's voice was incredibly loud!

In his world, within the Human Lord Seal, Monitor Heaven Marquis suddenly opened his eyes, and Su Yu's voice echoed, "Either commit suicide, or merge all your fortune into my world, your choice!"

Either way, the ancient fortune would dissipate.

The seal would also be lifted.

It's about time!

Many Heavenly Venerables have fallen!

Among the myriad races, the Nether Heavenly Venerable, Dao Heavenly Venerable, Sun Corona Heavenly Venerable, and Moon Heavenly Venerable have perished. Under the command of the Hundred Battle King, Wujie seems to have survived, but Su Yu paid no mind. Red Moon and Blood Shadow were swiftly dealing with Yue Xiao and Yue Luo. Regardless, on the Hundred Battle King's side, apart from Changqing and Changmei, the others who advanced were of no consequence.

It was time to unseal!

As long as the number of enemies decreased, even if the myriad races produced more rulers of laws, they wouldn't dare act rashly.

At this moment, within Su Yu's world, the face of the Heaven Monitoring Marquis shifted. "You're not coming to kill me yourself?"

"Do you think you're worthy?"

Su Yu's cold voice echoed, "You have two choices. Quickly, either you voluntarily integrate into my world, and I'll bear the fortune, taking on the ancient grievances, or I simply need to unseal!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis sighed, remained silent for a moment, and then rapidly disintegrated himself. A torrent of overwhelming fortune power spread throughout Su Yu's world.

At this moment, a group of ancient powerhouses suddenly felt a sense of unease!

The sky was falling!

No, it seemed like something was missing, yet it also seemed like nothing was.

In the lower realm, the River of Time trembled slightly. In the upper realm, the Human Emperor's Great Dao suddenly erupted with a formidable power, extracting some power from the River of Time—the power of the seal!

The ancient seal could now disappear!

...

In the River of Time, there was a section that had always been shrouded by a thin membrane, unnoticed by anyone. However, whenever a Heavenly Venerable attempted to break through, they would find themselves obstructed!

But today, this thin membrane shattered bit by bit, and the Human Emperor's Great Dao swiftly absorbed the sealing power.

The previously stable river waters began to flow turbulently!

There had always been a gap between the tributary and the main path, but now, the tributary and the main path suddenly began to merge!

The seal, which had bound the myriad realms for a hundred thousand years, was completely shattered!

...

In Su Yu's world, a vast amount of fortune power merged!

Su Yu's world rapidly expanded and grew!

Within the world, the powerhouses who were still slaughtering suddenly sensed something. In the blink of an eye, some people's auras grew stronger.

At this moment, from all directions, the auras of numerous powerhouses began to fluctuate!

The Giant Axe Marquis was about to chop down Yue Luo and the others when suddenly, halfway there, his aura violently fluctuated. In an instant, a massive axe appeared in the void, and the Giant Axe Marquis was momentarily stunned.

Heavenly Venerables are essentially rulers of laws, but they haven't fully mastered the Great Dao.

Because they couldn't!

At this moment, the Giant Axe Marquis was momentarily bewildered and muttered, "The Axe Dao... wasn't it controlled by the Axe King before?"

He's dead!

The Giant Axe Marquis suddenly realized this, feeling a bit sorrowful. The Axe King, one of the thirty-six Human Kings, was dead!

Otherwise, even if the seal was broken, it wouldn't have concerned him!

Gritting his teeth, the next moment, the Giant Axe Marquis roared, instantly merging into the world. A powerful force of comprehension spread upward along the Axe Dao, and in an instant, he gained control over the entire Axe Dao!

Boom!

A surge of overwhelming aura erupted in an instant, and the Giant Axe Marquis was the first to step into the realm of a ruler of laws.

At this moment, the Human Lord Seal of Su Yu surged with fortune.

In the River of Time, the river waters fluctuated, and a large amount of river water was devoured by the Giant Axe Marquis, extracting the power of the river water, instantly making him much stronger!

The aura of the Giant Axe Marquis rose sharply, and he laughed maniacally!

He had broken through!

He officially stepped into the realm of a ruler of laws, and at this moment, he didn't even have time to mourn for the Axe King. After all, they hadn't seen each other for many years. If the Axe King hadn't died, he wouldn't have had the chance to step into the realm of a ruler of laws!

Meanwhile, on the side of the myriad races, the Desolate Heavenly Venerable roared, his aura changed, and boom!

A giant earth titan appeared!

On the side of the myriad races, the Desolate Heavenly Venerable was the first to step into the realm of a ruler of laws after the unsealing, and it was almost effortless.

However, on the side of the Immortal Race's Origin Saint, there was no movement.

No one was surprised because the Origin Saint... walked the Immortal Emperor's Great Dao, and the Immortal Emperor was still alive!

The next moment, a giant dragon and a phoenix both began to roar.

Both sides seemed to be advancing!

But this might not be a good thing. The paths they walked were once walked by someone from the Dragon and Phoenix races. Now that they could advance, it meant that the rulers of laws of those paths had fallen!

Otherwise, it would be impossible to become rulers of laws!

On one side of the world, March looked sorrowful, "January isn't dead!"

"......"

Around him, a group of people looked at him, dumbfounded.

That's your grandfather!

How could you say that!

March was helpless and sorrowful. February, his father, had died.

But the Great Dao had been inherited by September.

And he walked the path of January, but since January was still alive, he had no reaction!

How sorrowful!

He couldn't become a ruler of laws!

January was still alive!

The Giant Axe had advanced, but he hadn't. Wasn't that sorrowful?

Moreover, he hadn't integrated into Su Yu's world, so those who had integrated into Su Yu's world also grew stronger, but he hadn't. The more he thought about it, the more sorrowful he became!

In the distance, Su Yu avoided the Hundred Battle King and was surprised, "January is still alive?"

What a pity!

March couldn't advance!

This was truly a sad thing!

On the side of the myriad races, even the Saint Marquis was about to advance!

Once successful, on the side of the myriad races, the Saint Marquis, Dragon, Phoenix, Desolate, and the Divine Emperor's Consort, except for the unlucky Origin Saint, seemed to have all advanced. Five rulers of laws, wasn't that a bit of a loss for me?

On my side, apart from the Giant Axe advancing, was there no one else who could advance?

The more Su Yu thought about it, the more he felt at a loss!

Just as he was thinking, a booming sound erupted on his side, Hongmeng!

Yes, Hongmeng, who had just advanced to Heavenly Venerable not long ago, suddenly had his Great Dao tremble. Yes, his path was opened by his Dao companion, who had long since died. A Heavenly Venerable is a ruler of laws!

It had nothing to do with just having advanced.

A great mountain floated above Hongmeng, and at this moment, a sigh full of emotion came from Hongmeng.

After countless years, he had also stepped into the realm of a ruler of laws!

As this ended, further away, the Great Zhou King also had a complex expression, his aura surging, two forces of the Great Dao clashing within him, and in an instant, his aura soared!

The Great Zhou King had genuinely advanced to the Heavenly Venerable realm, not just in strength.

At this moment, he also advanced!

Su Yu was surprised. This guy wasn't self-sealing his cultivation, but genuinely hadn't reached the realm of a ruler of laws?

He only reached it now?

Strange!

I always thought you were self-sealing your realm, like the Divine Emperor's Consort, but you weren't?

On Su Yu's side, the third ruler of laws appeared!

At this moment, on the side of the myriad races, the Desolate, Dragon, Phoenix, and Saint Marquis became rulers of laws, while on Su Yu's side, only the Great Zhou King, Giant Axe, and Hongmeng had advanced.

On the other side, in the midst of battle, Red Moon's aura suddenly surged, instantly advancing to the realm of a ruler of laws!

Not just her, Blood Shadow too!

The Hundred Battle King knew some of the circumstances, so he also knew which people could become rulers of laws after the unsealing. The people he left behind, those who became Heavenly Venerables, seemed to have walked paths that no one else had walked.

In the blink of an eye, over there, Changqing and Changmei also instantly advanced!

In the midst of battle, Thunderstorm's power of thunder flickered, and he advanced!

Yue Luo also followed, the Bewitching Great Dao erupting, and he advanced!

However, Yue Xiao's expression changed slightly. He hadn't advanced because he walked the path of chaos, and at this moment, he couldn't advance. Yue Luo walked the chaotic physical path, but primarily the path of bewitching.

In the blink of an eye, Changqing, Changmei, Yue Luo, Thunderstorm, Red Moon, and Blood Shadow, a total of six powerhouses, advanced to the realm of a ruler of laws. As for Wujie, who knew if he had died, his shadow wasn't seen.

On this side, six were born, and with Su Yu and the myriad races, a total of 13 rulers of laws emerged in the blink of an eye!

The myriad realms, after accumulating for many years, erupted all at once at this moment!

And this wasn't the end. Over there, the Destiny Marquis suddenly sighed, with some helplessness and sorrow, genuine sorrow: "Calculated everything, but not myself, the Fate Emperor... has passed!"

His aura surged!

But there was no joy!

The emperor of the Fate Clan had died!

He had actually died!

Destiny was sorrowful, unlike March, who should be laughing because his grandfather was still alive.

But the emperor of the Fate Clan was truly gone.

Destiny didn't know how the Fate Emperor died, but he had died, that was a fact. Unless he changed his path, he couldn't advance at this moment!

Destiny couldn't be happy!

Maybe it was a good thing for him, but for the Fate Clan... even if Su Yu brought back the Human Emperor, his Fate Clan no longer had that Fate Emperor!

This was the fourteenth ruler of laws!

Not far away, March was envious, "Your uncle died, how delightful!"

Damn your ancestors!

Destiny's gaze was unfriendly, but March was indifferent, "They've been missing for a hundred thousand years, you should have been prepared, stop pretending!"

Well, that's also true!

When those people disappeared back then, everyone assumed they were dead, and indeed, there was some preparation.

Including when they truly perished, the Great Dao trembled... there was actually some psychological preparation.

But knowing they were truly dead was still somewhat sorrowful.

The fourteenth ruler of laws appeared, and it seemed to have reached its limit.

Wan Tiansheng and Lantian were both path openers, possessing Heavenly Venerable combat power, but they didn't have the ability to directly grasp the Great Dao. Their paths weren't fully opened, so this unsealing didn't help them!

The Tongtian Great Dao was special, requiring the consumption of gates, so it didn't advance.

Fat Ball also opened its own path and didn't advance.

The South King, Lanshan, and others had integrated into Su Yu's world, so the unsealing didn't affect them either.

The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger were the same, walking the path of chaos. Their only hope was to break through behind the gate or kill Yu Qing and devour the chaotic will to break through.

On Su Yu's side, the powerhouses who had integrated into the path all advanced by a notch.

Those who hadn't integrated, after the unsealing, four Heavenly Venerables advanced.

The myriad races also had four!

Chapter 838: The Unraveling

Among the subordinates of the Hundred Battle King, aside from Yue Xiao who couldn't break through and Wu Ji who disappeared, the remaining six had all advanced. Clearly, the Hundred Battle King had been preparing for this, calculating who to keep around. He had also planned to unseal, but his intention was to ensure all his subordinates advanced.

Unlike Su Yu, who had no choice but to accept whoever came to him, the Hundred Battle King might have eliminated those without hope of advancement long ago.

Now, there were fourteen rulers of laws!

Including the Divine Empress, the Hundred Battle King, Su Yu, Martial Emperor, Zhou Ji, Control King, Po Long, Undead Emperor, and South Heavenly King...

At this moment, the number of rulers of laws in the Myriad Realms exceeded twenty!

A hundred thousand years of accumulation had finally blossomed today!

Powerful auras surged across the heavens and earth!

However, it was a pity that Po Long couldn't witness it. As everyone completed their advancements, Po Long's half-body suddenly collapsed, exploded, and fell!

The Gate of Hell trembled violently!

It seemed as if another powerful being was about to emerge!

In the distance, South Heavenly King suddenly cursed, "Fool, can't you wait?"

She was scolding Su Yu!

Changqing and Changmei hadn't been killed yet, so why unseal now?

Just wait a moment!

She was about to lead people to kill them!

They had just encountered them... and now they advanced. Wasn't Su Yu digging his own grave?

Alright, even South Heavenly King was thinking of herself as a mother now.

She was indeed furious!

Su Yu was too impulsive. Couldn't he wait a bit longer? She was almost driven mad by Su Yu!

The leap from Heavenly Venerable to ruler of laws was significant. A ruler of laws could fight several Heavenly Venerables, so what was she supposed to do now?

Killing them was possible.

But it would clearly lead to greater losses!

Didn't Su Yu calculate this?

Didn't he see that many Heavenly Venerables of the myriad races had died, and he was eager to act?

...

Opposite Su Yu, the Hundred Battle King also laughed, "You seem to have unsealed a bit early!"

On his side, several rulers of laws had also emerged.

This reduced Su Yu's advantage.

Moreover, the myriad races suddenly had five rulers of laws appear. Apart from Yuan Sheng and a few deceased ones, the rest had advanced. Would these people still listen to Su Yu?

Five rulers of laws were enough to turn the tide!

Wasn't Su Yu worried?

"Idiot!"

Su Yu suddenly cursed, and the Hundred Battle King was slightly taken aback. The next moment, Su Yu roared, "By the decree of Emperor Yu, I strip Changqing, Changmei, and Leiba of their ancient marquis titles! Weaken their fortune, strip their fortune! Traitors of the Human Race, unforgivable sins, condemned by heaven and earth, plagued by misfortune!"

Boom!

A thunderous explosion resounded, and in the void, lightning flickered. In Su Yu's world, the Human Lord Seal trembled violently!

A powerful force of fortune swept towards several people!

In the distance, within the Human Emperor's path, a resonant tremor erupted, and the next moment, a voice could faintly be heard, "Approved!"

After speaking, it seemed that the person wanted to say more, "What are you doing..."

Stripping this and that every day, what are you up to?

It's making me very frustrated!

At this moment, along with Su Yu's force of fortune, the ancient fortune entangled, and the honest Human Emperor seemed to transmit a will over, stripping the marquis titles again!

Do you think my enfeoffments are for play?

Yet, the Human Emperor still agreed.

Thus, a thunderous explosion echoed across the heavens and earth, and the sound of breaking resounded. Changqing and the others suddenly screamed, the path backfired, and the power of the path they had just mastered backfired on themselves!

Boom!

Several people couldn't withstand this backlash and exploded. Su Yu shouted, "Quick, drag them into my world... Letting them advance was for profit!"

Without their advancement, what was the point of integrating Heavenly Venerables?

Only by integrating rulers of laws could one profit!

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King's face turned completely dark!

He had calculated everything... but didn't expect Su Yu to collude with the Human Emperor across space!

Taking advantage of the moment they advanced, he stripped all their Human Race fortune. These people were different from the Control King, who was too strong and unaffected.

But they were different!

They were originally part of the Human Race, inheriting a large amount of Human Race fortune. Their marquis titles were a form of strength enhancement and talent enhancement. When Su Yu stripped everything away... naturally, they would be extremely unlucky!

And this was within Su Yu's calculations.

When he stripped the Control King's fortune, it didn't affect the Control King and his lineage much because the Control King was inherently terrifyingly strong, enough to support his race!

Only now did everyone realize the terror of fortune!

The path of fortune was elusive!

However, when Su Yu devoured the Monitor Heaven Marquis, the bearer of ancient fortune, his fortune became absurdly strong!

Completely suppressing the Hundred Battle King's side!

Yet, Changqing and the others all had marquis titles!

At this moment, who else would be unlucky if not them?

South Heavenly King was overjoyed, "Well done, good son..."

"......"

Silence fell all around, and Su Yu's face stiffened. Who was she calling?
