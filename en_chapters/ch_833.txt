Chapter 833: Memories at Age Six (Subscription Request)

The Three Body Method, the fusion of three bodies.

Extracting the past and future from the River of Time is essentially drawing upon the power of origin.

...

"The Three Body Method requires a vessel, a medium that connects to the River of Time and serves as a conduit for the origin. A powerful physical body might not need a vessel and can directly connect."

At this moment, Su Yu fell into deep thought.

He had returned to his own world, contemplating whether he needed a vessel to draw upon the past and future from the River of Time. Could his physical body bear the three bodies?

"The vessel is needed because the physical body isn't strong enough to bear the excess power, requiring another medium to support it. If my three bodies are weak, I can bear them, but once they become powerful..."

Su Yu's physical body might not keep up.

His body wasn't as strong as Hundred Battle King’s, but after the severance of the paths by Hundred Battle King and Zhou Ji, Su Yu's world accommodated the path of the physical body, making it quite strong.

Perhaps he could give it a try!

Integrating the three bodies into one is the better choice.

Using a vessel always adds a layer of separation.

"Now, I need to consider how to draw upon the three bodies. Will there be any unexpected consequences?"

Thoughts flickered through his mind, and soon, Su Yu's lips moved slightly.

...

Moments later, several people appeared.

The Great Zhou King, Wan Tiansheng, Consort Qi, and the South Heavenly King were present. Su Yu hadn't called anyone else, as they might not have any useful suggestions.

The group entered, exchanging glances, somewhat surprised.

Su Yu usually only sought them out when he encountered a problem.

They entered the room.

Before anyone could speak, Su Yu directly asked, "What do you know about the Three Body Method?"

"The Three Body Method?"

They looked at each other. Before the Great Zhou King could speak, Consort Qi said, "Your Majesty, are you referring to the Three Body Method that wasn't very popular back then?"

She knew quite a bit and quickly continued, "During the third tide, not many practiced the Three Body Method, but after the third tide, it seemed to become more common..."

She had gone into seclusion during the mid-third tide, but she had asked around and knew that the Three Body Method later became mainstream.

Hearing Su Yu's question, she quickly added, "In my opinion, the Three Body Method is quite unique. It grants two extra lives and later became a mandatory part of the rules..."

Su Yu interrupted, "Wasn't the Three Body Method mandatory during the third tide?"

Was there no rule punishment?

Not following the Three Body Method would result in rule punishment.

Consort Qi explained, "It wasn't that severe back then. Not following the Three Body Method only resulted in mild rule punishment. Later, I heard that not following it would often lead to death, which was different from the third tide."

Su Yu fell into contemplation and slowly asked, "When did the Three Body Method start to become popular?"

The Great Zhou King knew and replied, "After the sixth tide, the Three Body Method became mainstream! Rule punishment became increasingly severe, posing a massive threat to those who didn't follow it!"

Su Yu frowned, "So, it only became mainstream after the sixth tide. But according to our understanding, the rules were set by the council and the Human Emperor back then. Does that mean they were gradually tightening the paths for other methods? Why?"

He looked at the Great Zhou King, "Do you know why they forced everyone to practice the Three Body Method?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and said, "It might be related to the source qi of the world, or perhaps the increase in Daofuse cultivators across the Myriad Realms, or the growing number of rulers of laws, leading to excessive consumption. The Three Body Method reduces consumption significantly!"

"You don't know more?"

The Great Zhou King was puzzled, "Which aspect is Your Majesty referring to?"

This time, he truly didn't understand what Su Yu meant. What more did he need to know?

Su Yu frowned, "The Three Body Method grants three lives. Shouldn't that be highly valued?"

"But the Three Body Method is very weak..."

The Great Zhou King murmured. Such a weak technique would only be practiced when there was no other choice. Even with three lives, what could one do?

Why did Su Yu suddenly bring this up?

But Su Yu frowned again, "Isn't resurrection worth valuing?"

Previously, I didn't pay much attention. Now, it seems the Great Zhou King and others didn't either. Isn't resurrection worth valuing?

Not to mention myself, logically, during the era of the Human Emperor and others, the Three Body Method already existed. Why didn't they care either?

Practicing the Three Body Method grants three lives!

Resurrection!

Others might not know, but the Human Emperor and Culture King should understand the difficulty of resurrecting Xingyue, right?

Why didn't they care about this technique?

Hearing this, the Great Zhou King and others were slightly stunned. Indeed, three bodies and three lives were worth valuing, but... the Great Zhou King still said solemnly, "But this method is very weak, and the so-called three lives seem to have little effect..."

What nonsense!

How could it be useless?

Practitioners of the Three Body Method were inherently better at preserving their lives!

Su Yu looked at them, falling into contemplation again, and said, "Is it because you think it's useless that you don't care?"

This doesn't match the character of these powerful beings.

Under normal circumstances, even if Su Yu didn't care, he would investigate. But previously, Su Yu didn't seem to care much and hadn't studied the Three Body Method deeply.

Su Yu thought of a possibility... rule influence!

Now, having opened his own world and broken the rule influence, could it be because of this?

Just like the Great Zhou Heavenly Method, it couldn't be fully spread because of influence.

Could it be that some powerful being had set such a rule influence?

Clearly important, yet no one cared about it.

During the era of the Human Emperor, since the Three Body Method had just emerged and few practiced it, no one cared. According to the Great Zhou King and others, it wasn't until after the sixth tide that it was fully valued!

At this moment, Su Yu was also somewhat confused.

And the Great Zhou King and others were all lost in thought. After a while, Wan Tiansheng spoke, "Your Majesty, did you mention the Three Body Method because it has some special aspect? The Three Body Method can save lives; I've personally experienced resurrection. But it's also true that its strength is lacking."

Su Yu smiled, "That's for the ordinary Three Body Method! I'm thinking, if we can still draw upon the three bodies now, what would be the result?"

Wan Tiansheng was slightly taken aback. Now?

None of them followed the Three Body Method anymore. Could they still draw upon the three bodies?

That would naturally be icing on the cake, elevating them to a higher level!

The Great Zhou King was also internally shaken, "Your Majesty means we can still draw upon the three bodies now?"

That can't be possible!

Su Yu smiled, "Just a trial. Moreover, in my view, the Three Body Method is about drawing the origin back, similar to the resurrection of the dead! Merging with the power of origin to strengthen oneself!"

"Of course, this would lead to the River of Time being drained of its origin. If the Master of Time is like the Master of Death, we'd be in trouble... But the Master of Time, whether truly dead or indifferent, has never cared. Everyone practicing the Three Body Method is depriving the origin, yet the River of Time has never cared, right?"

At this moment, Su Yu didn't know what the situation with the Master of Time was.

But he knew that drawing upon the past and future from the River of Time had never been hindered by the Master of Time, which was curious.

The group’s eyes flickered. If what Su Yu said was true, and they could draw upon the three bodies, everyone could become significantly stronger.

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Your Majesty, the Three Body Method involves drawing upon the past and future, which is only possible at the peak of the Sunmoon Realm when first contacting the River of Time and the power of laws. How can we draw upon it now?"

How to draw upon it now?

Wan Tiansheng also spoke, "We've all merged with Your Majesty's path. Can we still draw upon the origin from the River of Time?"

This was also a problem!

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Let's try! I observed earlier that we've always lived in the Myriad Realms, leaving many traces! That's the origin!"

"I called you here to refine the method of drawing upon it and to see if everyone is suitable... The last point is... how to open different Rivers of Time?"

Everyone was stunned. Different rivers?

Su Yu said softly, "Have you forgotten? When we open the River of Time, it's different. The current river doesn't include memories! But the river opened by the Three Body Method is a personal memory..."

Hearing this, the South Heavenly King and Consort Qi were both stunned. Consort Qi asked in surprise, "What memories?"

The Great Zhou King was also taken aback, looking at the two, "Haven't you opened such a river?"

"......"

Suddenly, everyone was confused.

Su Yu wasn't too concerned, "I haven't opened such a river either! I've always opened the main path, seeing the current river. It seems that without practicing the Three Body Method, it can't be opened!"

Wan Tiansheng had opened it before and even showed it to Su Yu.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng was also surprised, "Is it possible that everyone opens the River of Time differently?"

Increasingly strange!

He thought everyone had seen it.

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King again, "When you merged with the path before, did you open the river like this? Did you see the memory river or the mainstream river?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and said, "I... I haven't opened the memory river myself, but someone showed it to me. Besides, last time I went with Your Majesty to see Wang Hu's memory river... So I think maybe I merged with the path early, so I don't have that experience... But I know the Three Body Method has it!"

He explained, "I thought it was a technique issue, but I figured the South Heavenly King and others should know. Now it seems they don't, which means they didn't have it before?"

Strange!

He pondered for a moment, comparing it to ancient times. Unfortunately, during that era, there were too few cultivators, and he hadn't heard of such things.

At this point, Wan Tiansheng was also puzzled. "Has no one ever activated it?"

"I did activate such a river of memories... Is there something different about it?" he continued. "Later, I thought I had grown stronger, so I couldn't activate it anymore. I didn't pay much attention, assuming that some illusions of past and future in the river had disappeared..."

He had defined these as illusions! In his weaker days, that was what he believed.

But Su Yu quickly began to think. Illusions? His own river of memories...

He closed his eyes and fell into deep thought. After a while, Su Yu suddenly asked, "Do you think the Three Body Method is about cultivating oneself or cultivating the Great Dao?"

What did he mean?

Everyone looked at him again, even more confused.

Su Yu explained, "I mean, is the Three Body Method about cultivating one's own river of time, or is it about cultivating the power of the Great Dao within the river of time?"

Nonsense!

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "All cultivation is naturally about cultivating the Great Dao of time!"

How could it be about cultivating oneself? Wouldn't that be the path of chaos?

But Su Yu shook his head. "Not necessarily. The Three Body Method is becoming increasingly peculiar. I actually think it's a bit like cultivating one's own river, then drawing power from the river of time. Simply put, it's like creating one's own path, borrowing the power of the river, and then strengthening one's own Great Dao, eventually breaking away from the river of time!"

Su Yu spoke softly, "The river of memories... and the river of time might not be the same!"

Everyone was confused by his words, but they could grasp some of the general idea.

Wan Tiansheng pondered for a moment and said, "Your Majesty means that every practitioner of the Three Body Method has their own river of memories, but we draw power from the river of time through this river of memories, eventually extracting the original power and then breaking away from the river of time to create our own world?"

If that's the case, then the Three Body Method is terrifying!

Wan Tiansheng shook his head. "Wouldn't that mean everyone could create their own world? Wouldn't this be the method of creation rather than the Three Body Method?"

Such a terrifying technique was considered the most worthless method of proving the Dao. Could that be possible?

Su Yu didn't know either!

"Let's give it a try!"

Su Yu smiled. "Regardless of whether it's true or false, we'll know once we try! The Three Body Method connects one's past and future... Perhaps the river of memories is just another form, not necessarily a separate river..."

At this point, Su Yu wasn't entirely sure either.

He had to experiment personally!

As long as it could make him stronger, who cared?

Whatever issues the Three Body Method had, whatever its origins, he would eventually find out. It might have been developed by some great power, or perhaps by an ordinary person who inadvertently created something that could absorb the original power.

The Myriad Realms are vast, filled with countless extraordinary individuals!

If it was a technique born by accident, then it was nothing.

If it was created by some great power... then that person was quite extraordinary!

As for the purpose, it might be for personal cultivation, or perhaps to prepare for breaking away from the river of time, denying it the chance to continue growing.

Suppressing the Master of Time?

It's possible!

If everyone practiced the Three Body Method and absorbed their own original power, how could the river of time continue to grow?

If that's the case... the war across the Myriad Realms might have some underlying issues!

At this moment, Su Yu thought of this possibility.

The Three Body Method, being so weak, wasn't practiced by many. The Human Emperor and others in the Myriad Realms actually suppressed the growth of the Three Body Method. A group of ancient powerhouses didn't think much of it.

Their descendants, friends, relatives, subordinates... none of them would practice the Three Body Method!

It was too worthless!

However, when the powerhouses of the Myriad Realms left, the Three Body Method quickly became mainstream.

If that's the case, it indicates there might be some issues.

"The departure of the Time Sage was the root cause of the Myriad Realms' turmoil... The Culture King and Martial King left with him! These unexpected events might have been caused by the Human Ancestor's faction, but what did they use to plot against the Culture King and others? Yu? She doesn't have the strength or the brains for that!"

"But when I mentioned this last time, Hundred Battle didn't deny it... Does that mean the Three Body Method is also related to the Human Ancestor?"

The purpose, naturally, was to weaken the river of time.

Things were getting more complicated!

So complicated that Su Yu couldn't see through it all yet.

Forget it!

Su Yu stopped thinking deeply. The urgent task was to increase his strength. He had seen through the essence of the Three Body Method, and for him, it wasn't very dangerous. It was mainly about extracting the original power from the river of time.

"Weaken the river of time..."

In the depths of his mind, Su Yu suddenly felt that some conspiracy or grand plan was underway!

"Master of Death... Master of Time... Three Gates... Opportunities..."

One term after another surfaced, and Su Yu suddenly called out, "Death Emperor!"

In the void, the Undead Emperor appeared.

Su Yu said solemnly, "You mentioned before that the Three Body Method might be related to something the Master of Death said. What did he say?"

The Undead Emperor was somewhat uncertain, but he still spoke, "The Master of Death said that if someone wants to devour the river of time, it's actually very difficult. You must find three powerful beings, separate into three bodies, support the front, middle, and back sections, compress the river, and only then is there hope to devour the river!"

"That's roughly what he meant!"

He repeated it once more.

And Su Yu's eyes suddenly flickered. "Three bodies, three gates, devour!"

He thought of something and suddenly took a deep breath.

Not only him, but at this moment, because of his words, the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng also suddenly showed expressions of shock and uncertainty.

The South Heavenly King didn't think too much, but seeing their expressions, he asked in surprise, "What's wrong?"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Didn't the South Heavenly King hear His Majesty's words? Three bodies, three gates, devour the river!"

What?

The South Heavenly King was still a bit puzzled. At this moment, the Undead Emperor seemed to understand something and said incredulously, "Your Majesty means that now there are powerful beings using the Three Body Method to weaken the entire river? Then, perhaps three powerful beings have entered the three gates, and these three gates might be the three nodes of the river. Now someone wants to devour this river of time?"

He was again shocked. "The Master of Death is one of them?"

Is that so?

Because this was an idea proposed by the Master of Death long ago.

And the Master of Death had also said that the Master of Time had seized some great opportunity, and if he had come first, he could have done it too!

Su Yu was silent for a while, uncertain. "I don't know, but if the judgment is correct, there are three supreme beings in each of the three gates! Heaven, Earth, and Human Gates, with the Earth Gate in the Myriad Realms, the Heaven and Human Gates should be on the left and right of the river. The three gates support the entire river! Now, the Earth Gate might have the Human Ancestor, the Heaven Gate might have the Master of Death, and the Human Gate... I don't know if there's someone there, or... is the Human Ancestor actually in the Human Gate? Is there someone else in the Earth Gate?"

Su Yu said solemnly, "The spread of the Three Body Method might be to weaken the river of time, and the appearance of the three gates might be for a grand plan... to devour the river!"

Saying this, Su Yu suppressed the unease in his heart and said solemnly, "Let's not discuss this matter further. Stripping the original power might not be a good thing, and weakening the river of time might... also not be a good thing! Whether the Human Emperor and others know about this is also a question!"

Are there three supreme beings preparing to devour the river?

Is that why countless changes have occurred?

Su Yu couldn't determine this.

However, he couldn't continue to speculate. Further speculation might cause some trouble and touch on the interests of some big figures.

The Human Emperor and others might not have been simply plotted against, but rather, they might have hindered the actions of some big figures, which is why they were targeted and set up!

"The situation... is getting more and more complicated!"

Su Yu sighed in his heart, and Wan Tiansheng and the others' expressions changed several times, but they didn't speak further.

Su Yu didn't say much either and directly said, "I'll try to connect with the power of the past and future! You all watch closely to see if there are any issues. If not, perhaps everyone can give it a try!"

...

Su Yu didn't speak further about those matters, only asking a few people to observe.

This time, he didn't tear through the river of time. In a dizzying moment, Su Yu returned to the Allheaven Battlefield. The others hardly felt any fluctuations, and Su Yu appeared on the Allheaven Battlefield.

"Tracing the Three Bodies..."

Su Yu murmured, having some understanding of how to open the river of memories.

The source!

At this moment, it seemed that others heard the sound of waves, a great wave surging!

Boom!

Their vision blurred, and suddenly, it seemed they appeared in a place different from the river of time, yet similar and different.

Waves surged!

There were no tributaries, or rather, no tributaries existed. This was a dark river, with waves rising and falling.

Here, it was very similar to the river Wan Tiansheng had taken Su Yu through!

Su Yu's voice echoed, "The Three Body Method, the river of memories, are all ways of tracing the source!"

Everyone didn't quite understand, but they noted it down, having no time to think deeply.

And Su Yu's figure suddenly appeared in front of them, looking ahead, "The front is the past, the back is the future. Each wave is an important memory left in your life. The unification of the three bodies is about retrieving a powerful one from the past or future to strengthen oneself!"

This is the essence of the Three Body Method!

"And each wave is actually an important original source in your life... The true convergence of the original source is to incorporate the entire past and future into the body, uniting all sources!"

"Of course, you may not be able to retrieve them all. Normally, retrieving one is enough!"

At this moment, Su Yu led everyone forward, looking at the waves, smiling, "This is my past and future! When do you think, if I retrieve from the past or future, would I be at my strongest?"

Which moment from the past should he retrieve to make himself stronger?

The Great Zhou King spoke in a deep voice, "The strongest moment in His Majesty's past is naturally just now!"

Only just now was Su Yu at his strongest, wasn't he? Could Su Yu have an even stronger past? The future is unpredictable; it might be weak, dead, or perhaps very strong—who knows! But as for the past, there's no doubt!

Su Yu replied softly, "Perhaps! But I'm thinking, within the heavens and earth, I'm only second-tier. Outside of it, I'm just third-tier... My past, existing in the River of Time, is probably only third-tier. Can two third-tiers combine to make me second-tier?"

The Great Zhou King pondered. This... not necessarily! In other words, even if Su Yu retrieves it, he might not be able to become second-tier outside the heavens, let alone first-tier!

Su Yu continued, "Retrieving power requires a strong vessel and body. With my current strength, if I want to retrieve it, my body might withstand it once. As for a vessel strong enough... unless I use the Human Lord Seal, but that might only give me one chance!"

"So, either I don't retrieve it, or I retrieve the strongest!"

"When exactly was my past at its strongest?"

The crowd exchanged glances. Wasn't it just now? Su Yu asked several times, did he think there was a time when he was stronger than just now? Impossible!

Su Yu wasn't some ancient relic, immensely powerful from long ago!

"Your Majesty... do you think it's not the past?" Wan Tiansheng was puzzled. "I've watched you grow stronger, and you've never been weak."

Su Yu smiled, "Not necessarily! I have indeed been growing stronger, but... I'm considering the moment when I was six years old, when I fused with the Book of Time... could that have been stronger?"

Everyone was stunned.

Su Yu said softly, "When the Book of Time first appeared, did it carry some of the Time Sage's power? The Time Sage should be stronger than I am now. At that moment, when the Book of Time erupted with power, could it have made me, for an instant, stronger than I am now?"

Impossible, right?

Everyone was shocked. Could six-year-old Su Yu have surpassed his current strength? Even if only for a moment!

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "Unlikely. If Your Majesty was that strong back then... you would have exploded!"

Su Yu shook his head, "Not necessarily. Maybe... I did die, and the Book of Time brought me back. Who knows? When I got the Book of Time, my energy was almost depleted... I want to see what really happened when I was six."

That moment might truly have been his strongest.

Regardless, he'll find out by looking.

"Let's go. I still have the ability to go against the current, back to 16 years ago, to see how I fused with the Book of Time!"

Su Yu was curious about this. The Book of Time, as his father said, fused with him easily? Such a powerful treasure, even when Su Yu fused with it recently, it greatly enhanced him. Could his six-year-old self, with no strength to bind a chicken, have fused with the Book of Time? Just a day of fever, and that was it? Su Yu didn't believe it!

Perhaps there was more to it. Su Yu always felt it wasn't that simple! Previously, he couldn't open the River of Memory, nor had the chance to look. Today, understanding the essence of the Three Body Method opened the River of Memory. So, he decided to see what really happened when he was six!

...

A group of people moved against the current.

Su Yu knew that even if he didn't remember, returning to when he was six would allow him to see, just like Heavendoom did. Heavendoom, when in seclusion, didn't know what happened, but in memory, Su Yu saw that the Silk Destroying King's father changed his bloodline. Heavendoom himself was completely unaware!

So now, by tracing back his memory, Su Yu could also be an observer of that moment.

As for bringing the Great Zhou King and others, it was partly to let them see if there were any issues, and partly because he needed them to identify things.

Su Yu didn't look at the big waves along the way; it was meaningless. He knew those were scenes of his battles, no need to watch them again.

As he walked, he laughed, "My Book of Time was given to me by my father. Do you think my father... is a hidden peerless expert?"

He had speculated once before, but... his father didn't seem like a peerless expert!

The others were equally surprised. Even the South Heavenly King was astonished, "Your Book of Time was given to you by your father?"

This was quite unexpected!

Su Yu nodded, "That's right! Not only that, my father got the treasure at Xingluo Mountain. He also told me that Xingluo Mountain seemed to have relics, and he heard a sound... Now it seems, it should be the sound of the Time Waterfall, the sound of the Time Waterfall crashing down in front of the Culture King's Residence. Can ordinary people hear this sound?"

"No!"

The Great Zhou King was surprised, "Even I can't hear it!"

Su Yu squinted, "Wasn't it you guiding my father?"

He thought it was the Great Zhou King guiding him!

The Great Zhou King swore to the heavens, almost cursing, "It really wasn't me! I know where the Culture King's Residence is and thought about guiding someone there, but... I can't go there, nor can I open the Time Waterfall! I swear, it really wasn't me."

"I thought it was you!"

The Great Zhou King was helpless, "It really wasn't. Your Majesty, if it were me, I'd admit it! Let me put it this way, the emergence of the pen dao was actually guided by me... I knew where Xia Chen was hiding back then. When trouble arose with Hundred Battle, I deliberately suppressed Xia Chen, pressing him into the Human Realm... So when he revived, he found himself alone in the Human Realm, and eventually, he had to bring out the Culture Tomb and create the Multi-Character Academy!"

Su Yu laughed, and the Great Zhou King was helpless, "Really, the emergence of the pen dao is related to me! The ink dao... is also related! The ink dao inheritance was initially in the Death Realm. Later, I went there and brought out the ink dao inheritance... and gave it to Liu Hong. Actually, it wasn't given to him; he himself resonated with the ink dao. I chose him, and the dao also chose him!"

"As for the paper dao, it's slightly related... but I didn't initially choose Lantian. That pervert Lantian was driven mad by accident, split into countless personalities... Initially, I wanted Wan Tiansheng..."

Wan Tiansheng said quietly, "Really? So, my Seven Emotions and Six Desires Dao is somewhat related to you? The influence is quite deep, and the one who influenced me greatly was my senior brother! My senior brother treated me very well, but later fell, making me feel the warmth and coldness of human relationships, the ups and downs of emotions... My life has been greatly influenced by my senior brother!"

The senior brother he spoke of was Ye Batian.

Wan Tiansheng didn't follow the Three Body Method but later chose the current Human Dao, also known as the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Dao, which was actually inseparable from Ye Batian!

The Great Zhou King was speechless, indeed, Wan Tiansheng was still here!

He had no choice but to say, "I really don't know about that... Anyway, Your Majesty's case was truly an accident, unrelated to me! I didn't expect Your Majesty to inherit the pen dao, nor did I expect Your Majesty to inherit the Time Sage's dao lineage!"

Su Yu frowned, "Really not you?"

"Really not!"

The Great Zhou King felt wronged. If he had known Su Yu was so amazing, he would have nurtured him long ago. These things were actually beyond his calculations, "I didn't expect the Book of Time to return to the Myriad Realms!"

The Great Zhou King explained, "For this thing to return, without opening the Heaven Gate, how could it return? So, I'm actually puzzled as to who brought the Book of Time back? If the Time Sage could really open the Heaven Gate and let the Book of Time return, wouldn't it have returned to the Myriad Realms long ago?"

Indeed!

Su Yu's heart trembled slightly, and he said in a low voice, "You mean... there might be a strong person who opened the Heaven Gate, transmitting the Book of Time back from within?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "But as far as I know, the time I got the Book of Time and the time Liu Hong inherited the ink dao were around the same period!"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and explained, "This... I'm really not too sure! The reason I chose that time was because, during that period, there was a tremor in the dao, the River of Time shook, and the Death Path seemed to be shaking too... I saw the timing was right and guided Liu Hong to inherit the ink dao!"

He merely provided Liu Hong with the best timing to inherit the dao.

"Otherwise, under normal circumstances, inheriting the ink dao is very difficult due to the suppression of the Death Path..."

Su Yu nodded and said no more.

The Great Zhou King repeatedly denied it was him, so the probability wasn't high.

Otherwise, there was no need to deny it. At this moment, Su Yu was about to see it, and this guy should take the opportunity to claim credit, saying, "Your Majesty, see, I gave you the opportunity..." But now, the Great Zhou King didn't admit it, so this possibility was actually not high!

The group continued forward, and soon, Su Yu's eyes moved slightly.

Ahead, a huge wave, larger than any before, was surging!

At this moment, even the Great Zhou King and others changed color slightly. Such a large wave, it felt even bigger than when Su Yu killed Hundred Battle!

Su Yu was right!

When he was six, he might have been really strong, or strong for an instant!

Su Yu looked at the wave ahead, took a deep breath, and smiled, "Let's go, see what happened when I was six!"

The wave was so large, even more turbulent than when Heavendoom discovered Lantian's true identity, which was very unusual!

Su Yu no longer hesitated and quickly led the group into the wave.

Boom!

The world spun, and they seemed to return to 16 years ago.

Nanyuan appeared before their eyes.

The ancient city of Nanyuan, 16 years ago!

And before them, a child appeared, a small child, looking somewhat frail.

"A-Yu, your dad hasn't come back yet?"

Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.

A voice, youthful yet brash, echoed through the air. Even at such a young age, the speaker's tone was already somewhat reckless. Su Yu instantly recognized the voice—it was Chen Hao, someone he had known for many years. When they were younger, they had been neighbors until Chen Hao's father got a promotion and moved away.

"Not yet!"

The little boy, who had been seen earlier, sniffled, his voice still carrying a hint of innocence. "Haozi, my dad said he'd be back soon and would bring me some treats... I'll share half with you..."

"Treats?"

Beside him stood a larger child, much sturdier than Su Yu had been at that age—like a little bull calf! He was drooling slightly. "What kind of treats? When can we eat them?"

The young Su Yu sniffled again. "If you go and beat up Wu Ah San, I'll share them with you..."

"Beat him up again? I can't do that. Last time, his dad complained to my dad..."

"Do you want the treats or not?" The young Su Yu sniffled once more. "At worst, your dad will give you a beating. But he's your real dad, he won't kill you... You beat up Wu Ah San, and you'll get to eat something good. Once Wu Ah San is scared of you, he'll have to share his treats with you next time. You could get treats several times over..."

"That's true!"

The sturdy boy nodded, a hint of anticipation in his eyes. "Ah Yu, if I take a beating, I can get treats several times?"

"Yeah!"

"Then I'm going to beat up Wu Ah San!"

"Go ahead!"

"......"

For a moment, everyone looked at Su Yu in surprise. Wow! You're just a kid, and you're already inciting others to fight? Were you always like this?

Su Yu, however, was lost in his memories. After a while, he said, "I don't remember much... Wu Ah San... I vaguely recall him. When I was little, he often bullied me when my dad was away. My mom passed away early, and there was no one to protect me... When my dad came home, he couldn't even argue with Wu Ah San's mom, who was a fierce woman..."

Su Yu smiled. "That guy used to snatch my food a lot, so I do remember him somewhat. Haozi often fought him when we were kids... That's probably how it was!"

Su Yu's smile was bright. "Wu Ah San... I wonder if he's still alive? I had forgotten about this until now. Yeah, that guy bullied me a lot. Later, he joined the army... I'll check on him later. He left at sixteen, so it's been six or seven years. I wonder if he's dead... If not, I'll settle the score with him!"

"......"

Everyone was speechless! Wow! You're the Emperor Yu! This happened over a decade ago. The guy might just be in the Skysoar Realm or even the Infinite Strength Realm now. Do you really have the heart to settle old scores with him?

As everyone was caught between laughter and tears, they suddenly heard the young Su Yu exclaim in delight, "Dad, you're back!"

At that moment, everyone turned to look in that direction. What they saw made their expressions change!

Su Yu's face also changed!

He looked over to where Su Long was. Su Long seemed to have suffered some injuries—nothing serious—but he was smiling. That wasn't the scary part. The terrifying thing was that behind Su Long stood a figure, its presence so overwhelming it seemed to blot out the sky and sun!

The waves of memory from Su Yu's childhood were massive, likely due to this presence!

Su Yu's expression changed instantly. He quickly grabbed the others and deployed the power of myriad paths to conceal their presence!

A powerful existence might detect if they were being spied on, even if it was something from over a decade ago!

Indeed, there was something wrong!

Su Yu was shocked, not daring to look too closely at the shadow behind Su Long. Who was this?

He was utterly terrified. Just then, another presence stirred!

A figure appeared, also immensely powerful... Of course, that was back then. Now, it wasn't much.

That was... the gatekeeper at Su Yu's school. Well, later he found out that it was the Great Xia King!

He had been guarding Liu Wenyan all along!

The Great Xia King seemed to sense something as well. He quickly arrived, looked around, and, finding nothing, was about to leave when a sturdy little fellow bumped into him.

It was Chen Hao. He bumped into the Great Xia King, then quickly ran off, shouting as he went, "Wu Ah San, my grandpa's here. He'll avenge me..."

Behind him, a few kids were chasing after him. Seeing the Great Xia King, they exchanged glances, intimidated by his robust appearance, and quickly turned to flee.

The Great Xia King seemed momentarily stunned. He looked around, chuckled, and shook his head.

Clearly, he had no interest in meddling in children's squabbles.

He glanced again in the direction where Su Long had appeared, looking puzzled. He muttered, "No one infiltrated here?"

With that, he shook his head and sighed, "Forget it. If that brat, the Great Zhou King, were here, maybe he could find something... I definitely sensed something unusual... Or could it be... that brat Wan Tiansheng running around again? Just stay hidden, why run around?"

"......"

The Great Zhou King glanced at Wan Tiansheng, and Wan Tiansheng looked back at him. They both laughed.

Sixteen years ago, someone had cursed them here!

Of course, they weren't interested in settling scores with the Great Xia King now. The two of them instantly grew serious, not daring to look back. Over there, Su Long was leading young Su Yu home.

Faintly, they could hear Su Long's joyful voice.

"Good son, we're rich!"

"Your dad got lucky this time... hit the jackpot!"

"Dad, Wu Ah San bullied me..."

"Oh... good son, bear with it. Once we're rich, we'll move to a bigger house. His mom is a fierce woman. A good man doesn't fight with women. If we go to settle scores, that woman could curse us for ten days and nights... Before we move, watch your dad punch through their roof..."

"That'll cost money... Dad, when we leave, let's trick Uncle Wu. Let's say Aunt Wu found a new dad for Wu Ah San... so Uncle Wu and Aunt Wu will fight every day..."

"Son, that's not very nice. At your young age... you should trick Uncle Wu into thinking Wu Ah San isn't his real son!"

"Oh, I get it!"

"Good boy!"

"......"

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng and the others felt even more peculiar. Teaching by example, indeed!

Who would have thought that Su Long, with his thick eyebrows and big eyes, was teaching his son to be so mischievous from a young age? No wonder he grew up to be so cunning!

Su Yu wore a blank expression. What are you looking at? My dad was just worried I'd be bullied. He was often away, and kids need to defend themselves if they're bullied, right?

Of course, none of that mattered.

What mattered was, who was that shadow?

The Great Xia King, an Eternal Peak powerhouse, hadn't noticed anything unusual, yet they had all felt that incredibly powerful force.

At this moment, Su Yu took a deep breath and suddenly closed his eyes. "Let's go, let's check out my house. My dad probably got the Book of Time this time. I want to see how this Book of Time ended up merging with me."

My dad isn't a powerhouse, but there was someone following him. Was this person always with him, or did they come because of the Book of Time?

That's what Su Yu was concerned about!

And who was this person?
