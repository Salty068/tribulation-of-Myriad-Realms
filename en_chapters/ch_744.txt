Chapter 744: The End of the Human Race (Subscription Requested)

Su Yu certainly wouldn't let her go. Regardless of whether she could repair or merge the Great Dao, she was a Heavenly King-level existence. If Su Yu let her go and she became an enemy, what then?

Qi Rong had given up hope on these matters. She quickly said, "Human Lord, I previously advised you not to kill pseudo-dao experts because pseudo-dao can be stripped away. Whether used for true dao or strengthening, they have significant value!"

"A pseudo-dao can devour a true dao, so naturally, a true dao can also devour a pseudo-dao!"

Su Yu was taken aback, suddenly realizing something. He nodded, "You mean if a true dao expert devours a pseudo-dao expert with the same Great Dao rules, the true dao expert will become stronger?"

"Yes!"

Qi Rong said solemnly, "Exactly! When the Human Emperor established the Land of Dao Source, I believe it was to strengthen true dao experts! As for pseudo-dao, I don't think the Human Emperor was interested in controlling weaker beings... but rather in better empowering his subordinates!"

This was a base for strengthening the Great Dao! What use did the Human Emperor have for controlling the weak?

Qi Rong continued, "Also, as I mentioned before, when more experts cultivate pseudo-dao, I believe there is hope to guide the Human Emperor back! The Dao in the Land of Dao Source is actually a marker, but now the Human Emperor can't find it or can't return. When this Dao becomes powerful, perhaps the Human Emperor can directly traverse back."

Clearly, Qi Rong had done extensive and thorough research on these matters.

Su Yu stroked his chin, lost in thought. Pseudo-dao could strengthen true dao. Su Yu knew this; he had previously allowed the Great Ming King and others to devour some of the small golden dragons he had taken. However, he hadn't let them devour those already controlled by the rules of the Dao. He had simply killed them, breaking the pseudo-dao.

Now, he was considering why pseudo-dao could devour the strong, but true dao could not?

"In other words, if I have an Eternal who cultivates the Dao of Fire, I can let him devour a Daofuse who cultivates the pseudo-dao of fire. Perhaps my subordinate can become Daofuse Realm?"

Su Yu asked, and Qi Rong thought for a moment before saying, "If the gap is too large, the devouring efficiency won't be high, and the power of the Great Dao may easily dissipate! If the gap isn't large, the devouring effect should be optimal!"

"A Daofuse devouring a pseudo-dao Daofuse might completely absorb the other's power of the Great Dao without waste. Moreover, this would actually broaden the original Great Dao, increasing its potential!"

These words connected to what the Great Zhou King had previously said about merging similar Great Daos.

Su Yu gradually understood.

"You're right. Those pseudo-dao experts shouldn't be killed. So, I've killed quite a few pseudo-dao Heavenly Kings before..."

Suddenly, Su Yu felt a pang in his heart. "I seem to have suffered a great loss! How many pseudo-dao Heavenly Kings have I killed? If my people had devoured them, wouldn't they all have become Heavenly Kings? Even if not, they could have become top-tier Daofuse!"

It was too tragic! These pseudo-dao experts were like the Dragonblood Marquis of the Death Realm, used as tools. But instead... he had killed them all!

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "Take Six Wings, for example. He should have cultivated a speed-type Great Dao. Speed... Little Zhou King's Time Dao is actually a type of speed Dao, an extreme speed Dao! Can he devour it?"

Even if not, there must be experts of this type.

Su Yu quickly calculated and asked, "Queen Qi, what Dao do you cultivate?"

Queen Qi's skeletal eyes changed color. After a long pause, she said, "Human Lord..."

Su Yu smiled, "Don't misunderstand, Queen Qi. I'm just asking so I can make arrangements. Maybe I can find a true dao expert for you to devour."

Queen Qi was speechless. She didn't know whether to say it, but some things couldn't be hidden.

After a while, Queen Qi said solemnly, "I cultivate the Dao of Petrification, similar to confinement, but the method is different. It petrifies people, sealing them during battle if they aren't strong!"

This was a type of sealing... Of course, Su Yu thought it would be handy for construction. Instant petrification would be excellent for building houses.

He didn't seem to have any experts in this Dao. The Control King's lineage was actually good at sealing.

Su Yu smiled, "That's not bad. I don't have many who are good at sealing. It fills a gap."

"Queen, recover your strength soon. Nowadays, any Heavenly King is crucial to me!"

Queen Qi nodded slightly, relieved.

She wasn't a kind person. However, in front of this young Su Yu, she didn't think she was as ruthless as him. This person blew up those Heavenly Kings like they were chicks, with an unchanged expression and a constant smile. Even Queen Qi felt he was not to be trifled with.

Moreover, being able to easily control the human race, even if there weren't many old antiques, having quasi-kings under him was real. The two quasi-kings beside him might not be weaker than Su Yu, yet they obediently listened.

Queen Qi nodded, and Su Yu smiled, "Then, Queen, please continue to stay in the Mark of Civilization for a few days. The Upper Realm is unstable lately, and I'm afraid someone might sense you. You don't mind, do you?"

Mind! In fact, Qi Rong disliked such small, enclosed spaces. After years of seclusion, she had had enough. But at this time, she couldn't oppose it. She quickly said, "I don't mind. It's an honor for Qi Rong to have a place to stay from the Human Lord."

"Well said!"

Su Yu laughed, "After all, you're a queen, the Human Lord's partner. Senior Yue Gang is my role model... Ahem, I'll treat the queen well!"

Role model, my foot! To end up like this, unable to protect even his partner, what kind of role model is that!

Qi Rong said no more. Su Yu's Mark of Civilization appeared, and Qi Rong entered willingly. Su Yu also stuffed many treasures inside for her recovery.

...

After Qi Rong entered, Su Yu suddenly laughed, "I'm pondering a question..."

Everyone looked at him.

"Do you think Hundred Battle is truly foolish or just pretending?"

They looked puzzled, and Lantian smiled, "What does the Emperor mean?"

"The previous generations of Human Lords were so miserable, all puppets. Hundred Battle wasn't a puppet. Many died to pave the way for him. Later, they all listened to him. The Torchbearers died for him, sealed for so many years, and everyone still hopes for his return... Is Hundred Battle really that foolish?"

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Killing those old antiques, maybe because they meddled too much? Hundred Battle might have just killed them all."

Lantian chuckled, shaking his head, "I don't think so! You said it yourself, the old antiques eventually listened to him. If so, why do this? I think he's just foolish, unrelated to anything else! Hundred Battle is too strong, living well, unlike Yue Gang's miserable state! Look at him, even able to hook up with the Giant Race. Who would trouble Hundred Battle for these reasons? Accuse him of colluding with foreign races? Look again, if Yue Gang married a foreign woman... So, the old antiques also judge by strength. If you're strong, everything you say is right!"

Su Yu laughed, "True! I overthought it. Speaking of which, Hundred Battle fought deep into Chaos Mountain. Why hasn't there been any news? Could he have been killed?"

"That's unlikely. If he were truly dead, others wouldn't say, but the Great Tang King and Great Han King below might have all advanced to Daofuse!"

Lantian said, smiling, "I suspect he might have rekindled old feelings with Moon Luo while fighting?"

Lantian smiled slyly, "Too bad, I don't know what Moon Luo looks like, her temperament, her style. Otherwise... I could try Hundred Battle's taste..."

"......"

Cough, cough, cough!

Su Yu started coughing, instantly looking at him, gritting his teeth, "Get out!"

"......"

Lantian looked at him with grievance.

Su Yu angrily said, "Get out first, let me calm down!"

"......"

Lantian, full of grievance, reluctantly transformed into a charming, enchanting woman, swaying her hips as she unwillingly left.

Su Yu exhaled deeply, damn it, why would you have such thoughts? Try Hundred Battle's taste, what taste? Damn you!

Being with Lantian, who had been much more normal lately, Su Yu almost forgot some past events. Now reminded, he felt helpless. Forget it, this pervert should stay away from me.

Meanwhile, Marquis Giant Bamboo and April exchanged glances, both shivering with fear.

Truly perverted! Emperor Yu's subordinates, few are normal.

...

The migration continued. One by one, various races arrived at Ren Mountain. The sweep continued as well.

...

Land of Dao Source.

A day had passed since Su Yu left. During this day, with several experts sweeping through, many slumbering experts were unearthed. Of course, some decayed skeletons were directly dug up. Some truly died in seclusion, unknown to anyone, as the power of rules had long dissipated.

At this moment, March and the others unearthed a complete corpse. The body was lifelike, but the aura had long vanished.

March glanced at it and sighed, "This seems to be the Eastern Qi Marquis of the human race, who actually died of old age. What a pity!"

Mo Tianzun also glanced, recognizing this figure. Among the 360 human marquises of the past, he was one of the stronger ones. His qualifications weren't lower than Minshan's, but he had disappeared for many years. Unexpectedly, they dug up his corpse here.

In the Land of Dao Source, after more than a day of sweeping, this was the second human expert they found. As for the first, he was now being guarded by several experts, captured alive!

Behind them, the elderly man with hair and beard trailing on the ground, seeing the corpse of Eastern Qi Marquis, showed a trace of sorrow in his eyes. Another old comrade had fallen! Died without anyone knowing.

If not for this sweep, the body might have remained buried underground for countless years, only to be accidentally discovered one day. By then, perhaps no one would recognize this person, mistaking them for some ancient powerhouse's remains.

Behind them, a Heavenly King-level expert smiled, "Two Heavenly Sovereigns, though this fellow is dead, the body remains powerful. Why not refine it into blood essence and distribute it to some juniors who need it for cultivation?"

March glanced at him but said nothing. Mo Tianzun also ignored the suggestion, observing for a moment before saying indifferently, "First, let's collect it."

Extracting blood essence from the body held little significance, at least not for him. Perhaps this body could be handed over to the Torchbearer lineage. Even exchanging it for a few talismans that allow entry into Chaos Mountain without being repelled would be better than holding a grudge against a corpse.

The Heavenly King behind them, seeing Mo Tianzun's decision, had no choice but to close his mouth. He quickly turned his gaze to the elderly man being held captive and gritted his teeth, "Heavenly Sovereign, this Marquis Nanxi killed many of our people back in the day. Now that he's captured, why not execute him on the spot to prevent future trouble?"

Although Marquis Nanxi wasn't a Heavenly Sovereign, he vaguely possessed the power of a Heavenly King. Of course, he was very weak now. This Heavenly King thought it better to kill him while he was weak, rather than sealing him and wasting manpower and resources on guarding him. To him, all humans should be eradicated.

"Blood Severance!" Mo Tianzun frowned slightly, "If you're going to guard, then guard properly. Stop with the incessant chatter!"

The Heavenly King beside him was none other than Marquis Blood Severance. Marquis Blood Severance sighed, "Alright, I won't speak anymore."

Today, Mo Tianzun seemed different. He had captured a powerful human but hadn't killed him. Yet, when it came to some Myriad Race experts, Mo Tianzun was ruthless. Not long ago, he had unearthed a powerful Immortal Race expert. Thinking Mo Tianzun was there to kill him, the expert resisted, only to be beaten until his body nearly exploded.

Marquis Blood Severance wanted to say more but feared being reprimanded. As he pondered, a sudden rumbling erupted in the distance!

Boom!

A violent sound echoed throughout the Source of the Dao. The explosion occurred where Moon Tianzun and the others were. At that moment, a formidable presence soared into the sky, and a battle erupted instantly. Moon Tianzun and Thunderstorm joined forces to suppress the opponent, though Thunderstorm seemed to be merely going through the motions. The newly appeared expert wielded a giant axe, splitting the heavens and earth with his strike!

March was taken aback, "Marquis Giant Axe!"

Mo Tianzun also frowned slightly, "Another human, and a Heavenly Sovereign-level human at that!"

It was unexpected, yet within reason. As one of the dominant races of the Myriad Realms, humans always had some old-timers nearing the end of their lives who chose to go into seclusion. Indeed, they had unearthed a top-tier existence—a true Heavenly Sovereign!

At this moment, the axe-wielding expert swung his axe, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to shatter. On Mo Tianzun's side, Marquis Nanxi, who was sealed and exhausted, cried out hoarsely, "Giant Axe, run!"

He struggled frantically! Another human marquis had been unearthed, not a corpse like Marquis Dongqi, but a living, incredibly powerful being! The humans were likely doomed. Otherwise, how could these foreign experts be allowed to sweep through the Source of the Dao? At this moment, Marquis Nanxi hadn't seen a single human, except for the corpse of Marquis Dongqi and the newly emerged Marquis Giant Axe!

...

In the distance, Marquis Giant Axe panted heavily. He heard Marquis Nanxi's shout, but it was tinged with bitterness. Run? Where to? Here, two experts of equal strength to him were in their prime, while he, having been in seclusion for too long, was in a dormant state, not at his peak. He might not even win one-on-one, let alone one-on-two.

Moreover, there weren't just these two experts nearby. He sensed at least six of such strength! Additionally, there were five or six quasi-kings slightly weaker. With such strength, he had no hope of escape!

Opposite him, Moon Tianzun's eyes flickered. A Heavenly Sovereign! An old human in seclusion had actually emerged as a Heavenly Sovereign. Should they capture him alive and hand him over to the Torchbearer lineage? A Heavenly Sovereign was top-tier combat power in this era! If it were a Heavenly King, capturing him and exchanging him for some guarantees and other things would be acceptable. But a Heavenly Sovereign—this would truly be aiding the enemy. If Marquis Giant Axe were to recover to his peak, he might take their lives!

"Giant Axe, surrender!" Moon Tianzun said calmly, "Do you think you can escape?"

Around them, Mo Tianzun, Desolate Tianzun, and others quickly approached. Marquis Giant Axe felt he was at a dead end. Filled with anger and unwillingness, he gritted his teeth, holding his giant axe, and shouted, "What has become of the humans?"

The Source of the Dao was supposed to be under human control! How did it come to this?

"March, you've betrayed the humans too!" Marquis Giant Axe sensed March's presence and was furious, "The Iron Devourer Race has been our ally for generations, and even you have betrayed us?"

"..." March pouted. This old guy was annoying! Look at Su Yu, so polite. Accusing betrayal right off the bat, as if he had any say in the matter. However, unearthing a human Heavenly Sovereign was unexpected. March was also pondering what to do next. Su Yu's side didn't have a Heavenly Sovereign-level expert yet... well, except for Fat Ball, but aside from Fat Ball, no one else was at that level. If they could let Marquis Giant Axe escape and be recruited by Su Yu, then the humans would have their first true Heavenly Sovereign-level expert!

As for whether Su Yu could recruit him, the success rate was high! March directly ignored Hundred Battle. At this moment, March quickly considered his options. In other directions, Destiny Marquis remained silent, Thunderstorm said nothing, and Desolate Tianzun and others quickly surrounded Marquis Giant Axe.

Marquis Giant Axe was filled with despair! There was no escape! He was doomed!

"I'll fight you all!" With a fierce roar, Marquis Giant Axe swung his axe, targeting March in the distance!

"..." March's eyes widened. Damn you! Why? Did I provoke you? "Traitor, the humans have treated your Iron Devourer Race well, yet you betray us..." Marquis Giant Axe was furious! Having gods, immortals, and demons as enemies was normal; he didn't care. But the Iron Devourer Race had always been an ally of the humans, and March had betrayed them. This was intolerable! Even in death, he wanted to take a piece of him!

A massive axe cleaved through the void, tearing the heavens and earth. One swing made March feel like vomiting blood. Why? A giant bamboo struck out! A series of strikes! Boom! Seven or eight consecutive bamboo strikes sent Marquis Giant Axe flying, spitting blood. Only then did March catch his breath, his eyes full of helplessness. Damn you! You attacked me first! I had no choice but to retaliate. If I didn't, you wouldn't escape, and it would make the three major races more wary of me.

Thinking of this, March could only silently apologize. You fool, if you ran in another direction, I might have thought of a way. But you targeted me directly, with everyone watching. It wasn't even a melee. If I let you escape, my Iron Devourer Race would be in trouble.

Marquis Giant Axe was doomed! Soon, Moon Tianzun and several other experts swarmed him. At this time, there was no room for one-on-one duels; it was meaningless. Capture him quickly! Several Heavenly Sovereigns joined forces, and in the blink of an eye, they had Marquis Giant Axe bleeding everywhere, his body shattered.

Seeing Marquis Giant Axe on the verge of self-destruction, Moon Tianzun and the others exchanged glances, their eyes flickering, but they didn't stop him. If Marquis Giant Axe self-destructed and died, the Torchbearer lineage would have nothing to say. The opponent resisted fiercely, and they couldn't capture him alive. There was no choice. They couldn't risk their lives to stop his self-destruction, could they?

As they pondered, even waiting for him to self-destruct, a special power suddenly enveloped Marquis Giant Axe. From Destiny Marquis, a calming aura spread, covering the other Heavenly Sovereigns, making them all feel at peace. Marquis Giant Axe, about to self-destruct, suddenly calmed down, showing a hint of enjoyment. However, he quickly regained clarity. But at that moment, a large bamboo struck him, leaving him dazed!

March's thought was that being alive was better than being dead. Alive, there was hope for rescue. Dead, there was no hope at all. Destiny Marquis stopped him from self-destructing, and March took the opportunity to knock him out!

At this moment, Moon Tianzun and the others communicated, "Is Destiny Marquis and March doing this on purpose?" "Intentionally stopping us, or rather, stopping Marquis Giant Axe from self-destructing?" "Is he from the Torchbearer lineage?" "How many agents has the Torchbearer lineage planted on our side?"

Destiny Marquis's actions seemed to them like he was trying to save Marquis Giant Axe. Now that Marquis Giant Axe was captured alive, forcibly killing him would seem like deliberate murder. If the Torchbearer lineage found out, would they retaliate? If they did, many pseudo-dao experts might die!

Moon Tianzun's eyes flickered, and suddenly, he shouted, "Bold scoundrel, courting death!" This shout left March and the others baffled. He was already captured, so why shout? At that moment, on a small mountain in the distance, a stone suddenly opened its eyes, as if awakening. It transformed into a humanoid shape, glanced over, and locked eyes with Moon Tianzun from afar. After a moment, the stone-turned-human sneered, then exploded with a bang, dying!

...

Moon Tianzun and the others looked grim. A stone? There really was a Torchbearer lineage presence nearby. The key was, they hadn't noticed it before, hadn't scanned that area. Were there others nearby? At this moment, they couldn't be sure. Although no one had appeared, who knew if they were deliberately hiding? March's expression changed slightly. What was going on? Destiny Marquis remained silent, constantly calculating. What did it all mean?

Thunderstorm was utterly baffled. "What was that just now? Why did it suddenly explode?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others remained silent, quickly sealing Marquis Giant Axe. Then, they tossed the furious Marquis Giant Axe next to Marquis Nanxi. Moon Heavenly Venerable glanced at the two and said in a low voice, "A Heavenly Venerable and a quasi-king!"

These were big catches! Should they really hand them over to the Torchbearer lineage? The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was inappropriate. But... if they killed them, what about the hundreds of Daofuse and the five or six quasi-kings from their own races?

His head was splitting with pain!

Sky Heavenly Venerable also spoke coldly, "Let's wait and see. When Dao Heavenly Venerable's avatars arrive, we can discuss it further."

Thunderstorm couldn't hold back any longer and frowned. "Why exactly are Dao Heavenly Venerable's avatars coming here?"

Sky Heavenly Venerable glanced at him and said indifferently, "To discuss capturing and killing Hundred Battle. What does Thunderstorm Heavenly Venerable think?"

Thunderstorm frowned at him. The tone was off.

Moon Heavenly Venerable chuckled, "Sky Heavenly Venerable, this isn't the time to discuss these matters."

Sky Heavenly Venerable replied calmly, "It should be discussed to avoid everyone pretending to be ignorant while knowing full well!"

He looked around and said evenly, "Among us six here, our stances are probably all different. I just want to say that in the eyes of the Human Race, we are all outsiders. The so-called Myriad Races never included the Human Race itself. The Human Race is the Human Race, and the Myriad Races are the Myriad Races! Even the Iron Devourer Race is just the Iron Devourer Race and will never be a part of the Human Race!"

March laughed dryly, "Of course, I've always supported the Myriad Race Council!"

"......"

Sky Heavenly Venerable smiled but said nothing more, only sighing, "Some things are disheartening! However, one must admit, the Human Race is indeed Heaven's favored child, the overlord of the Myriad Realms, always strong despite being wiped out time and again..."

The Torchbearer lineage and the Chaos lineage, both belong to the Human Race!

Su Yu said that the Torchbearer lineage and the Chaos lineage have been playing a game of chess for a hundred thousand years, using the Myriad Races as chess pieces. Is it true?

Perhaps... it is!

Thunderstorm frowned and remained silent, not understanding why this guy was suddenly lamenting.

Destiny Marquis also fell into contemplation, unable to deduce what Sky Heavenly Venerable was trying to say, and March was equally puzzled.

Sky Heavenly Venerable smiled again, saying nothing more, and looked at the sealed but still defiant Marquis Giant Axe. Suddenly, he asked, "Do you think we can still become rulers of the laws? It's said that the Myriad Races can't step into the realm of the rulers of the laws because of the Human Emperor's seal. Destiny Marquis, you are wise and brave. How do you think we can break the seal and step into the realm of the rulers of the laws?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable also spoke softly, "Indeed, we have reached the realm, but we are always a step away from becoming rulers of the laws, as if something is blocking us. Perhaps it is the Human Emperor's seal. How can we break this seal, Destiny Marquis, do you have any clues?"

"The Human Emperor's seal?"

Destiny Marquis looked at them, falling into deep thought. After a moment, he said, "Why do you think it was done by the Human Emperor?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable smiled, "Isn't it?"

Destiny Marquis pondered for a while before speaking, "It's possible! Otherwise, in a hundred thousand years, no one would have stepped into the realm of the rulers of the laws! The seal... may not be a seal. Over the years, I've thought about it. Since the seal couldn't have sealed the Human Race as well, I think... it's more likely a rule of the Great Dao covering the Myriad Realms!"

Destiny Marquis explained, "Perhaps, back then, some rules of the Great Dao were set, blocking the possibility of becoming rulers of the laws. To break this rule of the Great Dao, some opportunities are needed, some triggers... Just like the Three Body Method of proving the Dao, which is punished, becoming rulers of the laws is also set as something not allowed!"

"Breaking the shackles of the Three Body Method requires strong power to suppress the punishment of the rules."

"To break the shackles of becoming rulers of the laws... I think it requires achieving several points. First, find the source. Second, suppress the rule's riot. Third, expel the previous rule's restrictions..."

He spoke one by one. Since everyone asked, and they were all at this realm, he didn't mind saying a few more words.

Desolate Heavenly Venerable, pondering, said, "The source... what do you think the so-called source or trigger might be?"

Destiny Marquis thought for a moment and said, "It could be an object, a person, or a weapon... carrying the source of this rule of the Great Dao! It's unlikely to be a public rule of the Great Dao. Otherwise, back then, there were many rulers of the laws among the Myriad Races, and it wouldn't have allowed the Human Emperor to succeed in setting it up! It would only have been silently set up..."

Destiny Marquis didn't elaborate further. He thought that the suppression of the Myriad Races, including the Human Race, might have something to do with the ancient fortune.

Of course, such speculation is not easy to mention.

Sky Heavenly Venerable said, "Could it be related to the existence of the Human Race? If we annihilate the Human Race, completely destroy it, and sever all its inheritances, could this rule be broken?"

"It could!"

Destiny Marquis didn't deny it this time and nodded, "It's possible. So, if the Human Race is annihilated, these shackles might be broken, allowing us to complete our ascension!"

With the Human Race gone, the fortune dissipates, and there is hope to break it.

Destiny Marquis judged in his heart and asked, "Do you all want to become rulers of the laws?"

Nonsense!

Desolate Heavenly Venerable said gloomily, "Who doesn't want to? It's just that there's no way!"

Speaking, Desolate Heavenly Venerable said in a muffled voice, "Destiny, do you think the Torchbearer lineage might have a way to break the seal and allow people to ascend?"

"Torchbearer lineage?"

Destiny Marquis said oddly, "Probably not. If they could, the Torchbearer lineage's Bingku would have ascended long ago, but they still haven't."

Moon Heavenly Venerable said faintly, "Bingku is just a peripheral member. The Torchbearer lineage's three cores, Bingku and Danyu, are dead, and the third person has never appeared. I think this person is the true core of the Torchbearer lineage, the so-called lineage master! Maybe he knows?"

Destiny Marquis was speechless and could only say, "Maybe. Even if they can, I don't think they would let us know. After all, the Human Race itself doesn't have many who can ascend. Once the seal is broken, and we all become rulers of the laws, but the Human Race doesn't, then... the Human Race definitely wouldn't do it!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable's eyes flickered, "True, but if the Human Race could also produce a few rulers of the laws, like Marquis Giant Axe, do you think the Human Race might consider breaking the seal and letting everyone ascend together?"

He was contemplating whether not killing Marquis Giant Axe and the others might be a good thing.

If they killed them and the Human Race had no Heavenly Venerables, or just one or two, like the lineage master, the Human Race would never let the Myriad Races ascend together.

But if the Human Race also had two or three Heavenly Venerables who could ascend, would the Human Race take the risk and let everyone ascend together?

If the Torchbearer lineage can't deal with Chaos Mountain, would they take the risk?

Perhaps, this lineage really has a way!

Everyone is too eager to become rulers of the laws!

At this moment, Sky Heavenly Venerable also transmitted, "Moon Heavenly Venerable, maybe... we can discuss this with the Torchbearer lineage, even test them to see if they have a way! I know your brother is still alive, in the God Race! Similarly, whether it's the Immortal Race, the God Race, or the Demon Race, Heavenly Venerable, I think... it's not just what we see. Everyone knows it! If it doesn't work, capturing a few Human Race Heavenly Venerables and giving them to the Torchbearer lineage, what harm is there? If everyone can ascend... then the Human Race ascends two or three rulers of the laws, and we might be eight or nine... or even more!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable transmitted, "Let's see. For now, it's just speculation. That guy didn't mention these things before. I don't know if he didn't know or deliberately hid it. If they are really willing to cooperate, we can take the opportunity to talk to them again!"

"Next time we meet, I think we can test it. If we don't ascend and have no rulers of the laws, if what he said is true, and the Chaos lineage has them, and the lower realm has them, can we really win?"

"Indeed!"

The few of them conversed and soon dispersed, no longer communicating, continuing their sweep!

...

Meanwhile, the captured Marquis Nanxi helped the severely injured and sealed Marquis Giant Axe, looking at him with a face full of sorrow. "Giant Axe, it seems we can't escape this calamity!"

Marquis Giant Axe gritted his teeth, "If we die, we die. I have little lifespan left anyway. I was in seclusion to reduce consumption! But how did our Human Race fall to this point?"

"I was just forced out and don't know the situation."

Marquis Nanxi looked around and sighed, "Besides you and me, there's only Marquis Dongqi's corpse! Could it be that in the Myriad Realms, only the two of us from the Human Race survived?"

It's too sad!

It could very well be the case.

Otherwise, how dare the Myriad Races sweep the Source of the Dao?

Even if there are survivors, they are probably struggling to survive, scattered and hiding.

Marquis Giant Axe gritted his teeth, looking at those Heavenly Venerables who were still sweeping.

Following along, gradually, he said with some strangeness, "These guys have swept out so many old fellows, suppressing and expelling them, but they haven't been too harsh on us. Do they want to recruit us? Dream on!"

He was indeed a bit puzzled. Marquis Blood Severance wasn't too polite to them, but the Heavenly Venerables often just glanced at them and didn't say to kill them or send them away for detention, just kept them around.

Strange!

What exactly do the Myriad Races want?

They don't kill, don't ask anything, as if they've forgotten about them.

He was, after all, a powerhouse close to the realm of the rulers of the laws, just left here unattended?

No one even came to interrogate?

Thinking of this, Marquis Giant Axe suddenly felt disheartened, "The Human Race is probably really finished, and there's no need to ask us anything because it's unnecessary!"

Marquis Nanxi had the same thought.

Yes, the Human Race is probably finished.

If not, they could at least use them to threaten the Human Race, or exchange them for some treasures. Yet, these people didn't care at all, continuing their plunder without a second thought.

The more they thought about it, the more despairing it became!

The two of them felt utterly hopeless, not wanting to utter a single word.

Meanwhile, in the Source of the Dao, as the plundering continued, more powerful beings emerged. There were few humans, but by the time the deeper areas were cleared, a third captured human expert appeared.

Similarly, they weren't killed, merely sealed and tossed aside, leaving the three of them to console each other.

At this point, the human experts felt even more strongly that the Human Race was completely doomed.

(End of Chapter)
