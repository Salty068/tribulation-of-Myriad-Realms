Chapter 812: The Battle of Generals

Tensions ran high!

On this day, in the Upper Realm, the aura of Daofuse cultivators filled the air. On the peak of Ren Mountain, the myriad races' powerhouses stood with grave expressions.

Were they afraid?

A little!

Even though there were many powerhouses among the myriad races, including a group of Heavenly Venerables and even a ruler of laws, their opponent was Su Yu!

A man who constantly created miracles!

A man who repeatedly turned the tide, nearly annihilating the Control King's lineage, a lineage with countless powerhouses.

The myriad races targeted the Control King's lineage all because of Su Yu.

And when Su Yu's side, including Lantian and others, appeared, even the most foolish could understand that it was all Su Yu's scheme. He had deliberately drawn out the Control King's lineage, forcing their powerhouses into the open.

...

On Ren Mountain, Dao Heavenly Venerable spoke solemnly, "Tiangu, it's time to ally with the Control King's lineage!"

Only by joining forces could there be hope.

In truth, up to this point, Su Yu's side had not shown the strength to annihilate the myriad races, but just like with Tiangu, everyone had a certain fear of this young man, Su Yu.

A psychological fear!

Because Su Yu had only been to the Upper Realm a few times, yet each time he released Hundred Battle King or annihilated several Heavenly Venerables of the Control King lineage.

This time, Su Yu hadn't even arrived, yet there was already a sense of dread.

Unfounded!

This was different from the past battles with Hundred Battle King. Although Hundred Battle King was fierce, he hadn't killed as many powerhouses of the myriad races.

Su Yu, however, hadn't fought for many years, yet he had killed countless powerhouses of the myriad races.

Ally with the Control King's lineage?

Tiangu stood atop Ren Mountain, silent.

Ally?

Could they ally?

He didn't speak, but on the side of the God Race, the recently restored Moon Heavenly Venerable looked at the Divine Consort and asked gravely, "Consort, do you have confidence?"

This was the current strongest of the myriad races!

The newly succeeded ruler of laws, ironically, had succeeded with the help of Su Yu, the very enemy coming to annihilate them. How ironic!

And precisely because of this, the myriad races were even more worried.

Would Su Yu help the Divine Consort succeed if he wasn't confident? It didn't make sense!

Moreover, Su Yu's side also had the Martial Emperor!

The Martial Emperor was someone the Divine Consort could not possibly defeat.

The Divine Consort remained silent.

Confidence?

What confidence?

Confidence to deal with Su Yu, or confidence to deal with the Martial Emperor?

Yesterday, when the Martial Emperor broke his seal, his aura shook the heavens. Yet, not far from him, Su Yu remained calm. At that moment, if the Martial Emperor truly wanted to attack Su Yu, would Su Yu have been confident?

The Divine Consort had sensed it. When the Martial Emperor first broke his seal, he was clearly filled with anger and resentment towards Su Yu, but soon, the Martial Emperor left, not bothering Su Yu at all.

Was it because Su Yu had helped him unseal?

No!

The Divine Consort didn't want to think about it because it was terrifying. How old was Su Yu?

What did he have that could match the Martial Emperor?

One thought after another surfaced.

As for agreeing to Su Yu's request to kill Moon Battle to repay the favor of helping her succeed, did she really need to do it?

Or rather, would she even have the chance to do it?

What was Su Yu's intention?

If he had long planned to deal with the myriad races, why help her succeed?

At this moment, the Divine Consort was also filled with complex emotions.

And at this moment, the Human Race's army arrived.

Six Heavenly Venerables, their auras overwhelming.

Some were impulsive, like Desolate Heavenly Venerable, who gritted his teeth and said, "Su Yu hasn't come! There are only six Heavenly Venerables. Why not take this chance..."

He wanted to say, take this chance to attack!

On their side, there were quite a few powerhouses.

The Immortal Race's Saint Marquis, Dao Heavenly Venerable, Origin Saint, along with him, made four Heavenly Venerables. The God Race had two Heavenly Venerables and a ruler of laws. The Nether, Phoenix, and Dragon each had one, so many powerhouses. Wouldn't it be easy to fight against six Heavenly Venerables?

Even if Destiny quickly joined them, there would only be seven!

Killing seven Heavenly Venerables, even at great cost, would greatly diminish Su Yu's side's combat power.

Did Su Yu have any more Heavenly Venerables under his command?

He had only spoken halfway when Tiangu and the Divine Consort simultaneously shouted, "No!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable was frustrated. Why not?

Su Yu was arrogant, the Martial Emperor had left, and Su Yu hadn't come. If a great battle erupted now, with the Control King's lineage's two rulers of laws and Moon Battle joining the fray, annihilating the Human Race wasn't impossible!

Desolate Heavenly Venerable sensed it. Not only Su Yu, but even Hundred Battle King hadn't come!

The Human Race was arrogant!

Both Human Lords hadn't come.

These two hadn't come, yet they dared to deal with them and the Control King's lineage. Were they truly unafraid of failure?

"Why?"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable's face was grim. "You two, this is a racial war, a war that has lasted over a hundred thousand years! This concerns the survival of our races! We and the Human Race... have no room for negotiation!"

What were they thinking?

Afraid of Su Yu?

Yes, he was worried too.

But no matter how worried, at this point, it was time to fight with all their might, to fight to the death!

To make the Human Race suffer a crushing defeat, to let them know that the myriad races, who had dominated the Myriad Realms for over a hundred thousand years, couldn't be annihilated by Su Yu alone!

Tiangu slightly furrowed his brows. "Enough, Desolate, we know this is a critical moment of life and death! But wait a little longer! Do you really think Su Yu would send people to their deaths? Haven't you noticed Tongtian is here? When the Tongtian Gate opens, do you know who will come out?"

No matter how arrogant Su Yu was, he wouldn't gamble with lives, especially those of his subordinates.

When the battle begins, strong reinforcements will arrive immediately.

At this moment, Tiangu said solemnly, "Su Yu hasn't come, which means he's only besieging, not engaging in a decisive battle. There's still a chance! We can try to negotiate!"

"Hmm?"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable slightly furrowed his brows. At this point, negotiate?

Negotiate what?

But Su Yu hadn't come... Did that mean he wanted to negotiate?

At this moment, Desolate Heavenly Venerable also fell into contemplation.

And on the opposite side, in the Human Race's army, the Great Zhou King stepped forward, walking through the air, with the aura of Daofuse cultivators behind him.

The Great Zhou King looked at Ren Mountain, a familiar Ren Mountain he had seen before.

Of course, according to him, he had never been to the Upper Realm.

As for the last time he came, that didn't count.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King looked at Ren Mountain, his gaze slightly complex. This was the place where the Human Race had planned to build the imperial court. Back then, the Human Emperor had actually prepared to move, no longer using the Luminous Domain Mansion as the foundation.

The Luminous Domain Mansion could only serve as a temporary palace.

But before they could move, the Human Race encountered trouble!

One thought after another flashed through the Great Zhou King's mind. Today, the events of the past hundred thousand years echoed in his mind. The entanglement with the myriad races had lasted too long.

The secret guards left by the Human Emperor had also been exhausted.

All the backup plans had been exposed.

This was the last chance!

Fortunately, this tide brought forth Su Yu.

Otherwise, even the Great Zhou King would have been helpless.

The myriad races were strong, appearing weak today only because their opponent was Su Yu.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King walked to the forefront, facing Ren Mountain alone. He looked at the powerhouses atop Ren Mountain, at the few Heavenly Venerables who appeared fearful but hid it deep in their eyes, and he smiled.

"Everyone, it's been a hundred thousand years!"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "In these hundred thousand years, ten generations of Human Lords, eight died at your hands! Bingku died, Danyu died, Minshan died, Suppressing North died, Dingnan died..."

The Great Zhou King laughed and then sighed, "Blood debts upon blood debts!"

"From the ancient times, there were 109 Human Marquises left!"

"And now, how many remain?"

"In these hundred thousand years, the Human Race has birthed hundreds of Daofuse cultivators. How many remain?"

"How many of our people have the myriad races killed? How many of our powerhouses have they destroyed?"

"This hatred, even the waters of time cannot extinguish!"

Atop Ren Mountain, Tiangu said calmly, "Great Zhou King, this is war! How many heroes of our races have your Human Race destroyed? How many of our geniuses have you killed? Since ancient times, your Human Race has sought to dominate the heavens! You are the invaders, we... are merely defending ourselves!"

"Your Human Race is in turmoil, the Culture King and Martial King have left, the Human Emperor does not seek self-preservation, does not retreat to the Human Realm, but instead uses schemes to take away the emperors of various races, still wanting to dominate the heavens for countless years. We... are merely resisting!"

Tiangu's voice shook the heavens, "We are merely seeking survival!"

"We are also fighting for future generations!"

"Our ancestors were suppressed by the Human Race, and we have fought for a hundred thousand years, only hoping that our descendants will not be born inferior to others!"

Tiangu's voice was hoarse, "Are we wrong?"

"You are the invaders!"

"These heavens are not the heavens of your Human Race!"

"This world belongs to the myriad races, and the Human Race is just one of the myriad races. Why must you dominate the heavens?"

The Great Zhou King coldly retorted, "Tiangu, everything you say is just your imagination! Before ancient times, in the primordial era, was there not endless war? How many powerhouses died? How many geniuses perished? Moreover... these heavens are the heavens of our Human Race! This land is the land of our Human Race!"

"Whether it's the Immortal Race, the God Race, or the Devil Race, trace back to the era of creation, do you dare say you did not originate from the Human Race?"

"The myriad races that are not humanoid mostly evolved from the Chaos Ancient Clan... and these heavens were not opened by them, but by the Master of Time! Is the Master of Time a Human Race? I think... yes!"

The Great Zhou King's voice was grand, "Therefore, the unification of the Human Race is the will of these heavens and earth! Because we are the true masters!"

Both sides shouted, a pre-battle declaration, to justify themselves!

Who was the rightful ruler?

Who held the moral high ground?

Tiangu only expressed that statement, and soon, he said solemnly, "Su Yu is a smart person. Even if we fight to the death, he gains nothing. You must know, our ancestors are still in the River of Time, they are returning soon!"

"At this moment, Su Yu fighting us to the death is of no benefit... Great Zhou King, you are also a smart person. The myriad races still have the strength to fight, and if we fight to the death, anything is possible!"

At this moment, Tiangu chose to take the initiative to retreat, "I can promise that before the return of the Immortal Emperor and Human Emperor, the myriad races will hold fast to the Myriad Race Mountain, and will not come out! We only need Su Yu to give us the same promise... even if you break the heavens and earth, we will not interfere... how about each taking a step back?"

A concession before the battle.

The aura was already at a disadvantage, and the myriad races might curse and hate him, but Tiangu didn't care. If he could, he would choose this path without hesitation. Unfortunately, he knew it would be difficult.

As expected, the Great Zhou King coldly said, "Do you think that's possible?"

Tiangu remained silent.

The Great Zhou King raised his hand and coldly declared, "Emperor Yu is willing to give you a chance! A pre-battle duel! If you can delay until the Immortal Emperor returns, that's your luck... if not, then prepare to die!"

Tiangu's eyes flickered. What did he mean?

The Great Zhou King shouted, "Our side will send out a Heavenly Venerable, and you can send out a Heavenly Venerable. Our side will send out a Daofuse, and you can send out a Daofuse! A pre-battle duel, life or death, it's up to your abilities!"

Tiangu was stunned. Before he could speak, the Saint Marquis frowned slightly and coldly said, "You want to use us as whetstones, as trial stones?"

In an instant, they all understood!

Arrogant!

The Human side, the Great Zhou King and his people, were actually planning to use them as whetstones.

The so-called pre-battle duel was merely to temper Su Yu's side's experts. These people had advanced too quickly, and after entering Daofuse or becoming Heavenly Venerables, they had almost no combat experience.

At this moment, dueling with the myriad races was an excellent opportunity for training.

Life and death enemies!

One-on-one, evenly matched, such opportunities were rare.

No fear of accidental kills, no fear of accidental injuries, just fight to the death!

The myriad races' Daofuse and Heavenly Venerables were mostly veterans, while Su Yu's side lacked veterans and were all newly advanced experts.

The Great Zhou King coldly said, "Agree, and you can live. Don't agree... the myriad races will be exterminated! In a pre-battle duel, if your side is strong and can delay time, one person fights for a day, and before the three-month period arrives, we will not launch a full attack... Three months, your opportunity! Otherwise, today will be the decisive battle!"

At this moment, on the myriad races' side, some were angry, some were aggrieved.

Someone gritted their teeth, "Agree with them! But, in the duel, life and death are determined by skill, no interference, only strength!"

Are we afraid of you?

Tiangu and the others were clearly reluctant to fight, so delaying for three months... would there be any changes?

Would there be any opportunities?

...

"Drinking poison to quench thirst!"

These were Tiangu's words. He looked at the Divine Empress and the others, somewhat helplessly, "Su Yu wants a duel to find the best trial candidates among us! Delaying may not be beneficial, but if we don't delay... today might be the decisive battle!"

How to choose?

Delay or not?

The myriad races had the most suitable candidates to provide the Human side for training, to temper them on the edge of life and death, a true life-and-death battle.

At this moment, the Divine Empress and the others were all silent.

Delay?

Or go all out now and have a decisive battle with the other side?

After a long time, the Divine Empress sighed, "Agree! Three months... maybe there will be changes! Whether it's on the side of Prison Green or Hundred Battle, there might be some changes, maybe... there's hope!"

Of course, maybe it's also despair!

To be a whetstone for the Humans!

As for life and death, it can only depend on luck.

Tiangu nodded slightly, his eyes flickering as he looked at the Great Zhou King opposite, and said in a deep voice, "Duel... I'm just afraid you're too inexperienced, not knowing how you died! Great Zhou King, the Humans are cunning, dueling is fine, life and death are not counted! I'm just afraid your Humans will lose face and choose to intervene at the moment of life and death! Su Yu loves his generals and doesn't want them to die, we all know this!"

"If we kill your generals, won't Su Yu quickly renege?"

These words... the Great Zhou King chuckled, then quickly said indifferently, "Rest assured! The duel is voluntary, life and death are determined by fate!"

He turned to look at those Human experts, calmly saying, "Many of us have crossed from Eternal to Daofuse in an instant. After entering Daofuse, His Majesty has been fighting on the front lines, while we have been enjoying peace in the rear!"

"Strong men who cower will never become the strongest..."

As soon as these words were spoken, many people looked at the Great Zhou King. The Great Zhou King smiled, a self-deprecating smile, "Why are you looking at me? I am the same! I have been active in the Myriad Realms since the early ancient times, others have become rulers of laws, and I am only Daofuse!"

"Afraid of death, then this is the only way, watching comrades die, watching strong men die, only to be powerless in the rear!"

"I am a failure, I hope... this time, I am not, and neither are you!"

He looked around, at the Great Qin King, at the Great Xia King, at Xia Longwu and the others, "We are not cowards, we have fought in all directions, however, everyone, this past year, His Majesty has conquered the Myriad Realms, have we fought much? How many times have we fought after entering Daofuse?"

"In battle, there is only one method of self-destruction, because we rely on His Majesty's strategic planning, which can restore our bodies and preserve our will sea... Now, how much combat instinct do we have left?"

"His Majesty said, the people of Hundred Battle King have long been spoiled, and so have the myriad races!"

"But no matter how spoiled, they have fought for countless years!"

"Do we also want to become useless like them? Like clowns?"

The Great Zhou King coldly shouted, "Today, the enemy is right in front of us! The pre-battle duel, His Majesty's intention is to stop at the point! Nonsense!"

A shout of anger shook everyone.

The Great Zhou King... scolding Su Yu?

The Great Zhou King shouted, "His Majesty is kind-hearted! He doesn't want anyone to die, but I tell everyone, a war without death is not a war! A strong man rises from slaughter! His Majesty said, to gain experience, to have more means to deal with the enemy... nonsense!"

He shouted angrily again, "With the belief in survival, with the thought of not dying... once you encounter a strong enemy, you will surely die! Only by moving forward can you live, can you win, can you break through!"

"I am a representative of failure, I am, Dingjun is, Huoyun is, the remnants of ancient times, all are! But I hope, this tide is not! I also hope that everyone can become His Majesty, and not everyone enjoying peace in the rear, letting the emperor go to war!"

"We dared back then, we won't dare now?"

"We dared in our most difficult times, we dare now!"

"You are all still young, young, wanting to catch up with us old things, wanting to surpass, wanting to destroy, only by seeking life in death!"

He looked at those new generations... yes, the Great Qin King and the others were all new generations. The Great Zhou King said in a deep voice, "Don't let us old wastes affect you! We rely on living long to accumulate strength! You... have no time!"

The Great Qin King looked solemn, "We naturally dare to fight! The Great Zhou King's intention, this battle... duel... life and death, no assistance, is that right?"

"Correct!"

The Great Zhou King said in a deep voice, "Life and death, no rescue! His Majesty doesn't want to lose comrades... but I don't agree! Not only me, I think, those who truly understand, won't agree! If everyone doesn't keep up now, do you still expect to keep up in the battle of the rulers of laws... ridiculous! By then, you will die faster, by then, we will have long been left behind... become useless waste, waste soldiers!"

"But..."

The Great Qin King frowned slightly, "His Majesty... has orders..."

"Then cut me down!"

The Great Zhou King coldly said, "When a general is outside, military orders are sometimes not followed! This has been the case throughout the ages! Since His Majesty is not here, I am the commander, I have the right to make decisions on the spot! As long as my title of commander is not revoked, I have the final say! Great Qin King, you are the commander of this tide of the Human race, you should know, the opportunity for battle is fleeting, you are soldiers, you must follow orders! His Majesty will hold the commander accountable, it has nothing to do with you!"

The Great Qin King was silent for a while, then quickly shouted, "In that case, we will follow orders!"

The Great Zhou King ignored the others, instantly turned around, looked at Tiangu, and coldly shouted, "Pre-battle duel, life and death are not counted! Both sides' strong men, non-participating generals, must not interfere! If you can't win, retreat to the camp, and the battle is over!"

It's not necessary for one to die, but at the critical moment, you may not be able to escape.

As soon as these words were spoken, Tiangu's eyes changed slightly.

Su Yu doesn't want anyone to die, but his subordinates may not think so.

If this matter is really passed on to Su Yu, he may not intervene.

In other words... the duel is set!

Tiangu took a deep breath, "Fine! Since your newly advanced Daofuse dare, we have nothing to fear! Generals, listen to orders!"

"Duel, kill the enemy! Kill a Human Daofuse, reward a pseudo-dao!"

"Kill a Human Heavenly King, reward with Heavenly Venerable insights, and travel the Dao with the Heavenly Venerables, even with the Divine Empress, the Dao... will be open to you!"

Below, some strong men were shocked.

The Dao of the Heavenly Venerables and the rulers of laws open to them?

Is this... true?

Tiangu didn't mention the Heavenly Venerables, no need, the Heavenly Venerables don't need anything, nor do they need stimulation, killing the enemy is something they must do.

As leaders of a race, Heavenly Venerables are leaders, others can be cowardly, they cannot!

At this moment, the morale of the myriad races was much higher!

The next moment, on the Human side, a strong man flew out, Heavendoom holding a big stick, shouted loudly, "Heavendoom of Emperor Yu's Mansion, second-class Daofuse, come a second-class Daofuse or Heavenly King!"

So arrogant!

The myriad races' side instantly tensed.

This is truly arrogant!

Second-class Daofuse, Su Yu's division of Daofuse has actually spread out, everyone knows what it means, now, Heavendoom wants to fight a Heavenly King.

And the Great Zhou King, hesitated to speak, but didn't stop him.

This battle maniac, Heavendoom, chose to be the first to fight.

Known for never losing a fight, he couldn't hold back any longer.

In the crowd, Tiangu was silent for a while, Heavendoom was not easy to deal with, and he was good at fighting. Just as he was thinking about who should fight, beside him, the Immortal Battle Marquis said in a deep voice, "I'll go! I felt it, that's my weapon! He took my weapon, since he wants to fight a Heavenly King... then I'll satisfy him, kill him, take back the weapon! And let everyone see, whether the Humans will keep their promise! If not... Your Majesty, then... fight to the death!"

He was going to be the experimenter!

He was going to kill Heavendoom and see if the Humans would rescue Heavendoom.

Heavendoom himself said he wanted to fight a Heavenly King!

If the Humans rescue, then the previous talk of dueling is nonsense, if so, only fight to the death!

Tiangu was silent for a while, then nodded.

The next moment, the Immortal Battle Marquis flew out, coldly shouted, "Immortal Race, Immortal Battle! Heavendoom, arrogant junior!"

"Junior?"

Heavendoom bared his teeth, a fierce aura emanating from him. "Immortal Battle! You merely achieved Daofuse before me. For a hundred thousand years, if it weren't for my duty to guard the Death Realm passage, I would have surpassed you long ago! Today, I will kill you and show the Myriad Realms whether or not I, Heavendoom, am truly a waste!"

"Boom!"

A massive staff shattered the heavens and earth!

The battle erupted instantly!

Immortal Battle Marquis wielded a staff as well. His previous weapon had been taken by Su Yu, so he had crafted another. Now, both wielding similar weapons, they clashed fiercely in the void.

Those who wield staffs are often close-combat experts, preferring hand-to-hand combat.

In the blink of an eye, blood splattered across the void!

With a roar, Heavendoom transformed into a giant ape, his fierce aura spreading across the heavens and earth. He swung his massive staff, relentlessly pursuing Immortal Battle. Immortal Battle, too, swept his long staff horizontally, causing another thunderous boom. Neither side retreated in this fierce confrontation!

Blood sprayed forth as Heavendoom's grip shattered, yet he roared madly, swinging his staff a million times in an instant, causing the heavens and earth to change color. Though Immortal Battle was three times stronger, he did not yield, striking back with his own staff!

Boom!

Before Heavendoom's staff could leave his hand, his arm's flesh was pulverized, revealing deep white bones. Heavendoom's body trembled, his breathing technique causing his flesh to regenerate. He retaliated with a strike that split Immortal Battle Marquis's grip, blood splattering out.

...

The battle erupted just like that.

A duel of generals!

At this moment, in the distance, within Chaos Mountain, Wujie and his companions had just arrived. They turned to see two staff-wielding experts battling fiercely in the void, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to shatter!

They had just arrived, and already a battle had begun!

Wujie licked his lips, smiling. "It's Heavendoom and Immortal Battle! That Heavendoom has reached such a level... Exciting! A duel of generals? Su Yu has a good idea, using the Myriad Races as targets for training... A good idea! We should try it too..."

Just as he finished speaking, Blood Shadow frowned slightly. "You're overthinking it. The Sin Clan won't agree! Besides, they don't have many Daofuse and Heavenly Kings for us to train with. If it's Heavenly Venerables, are you going to fight to the death with Moon Battle?"

What are you thinking!

The situation is completely different; copying Su Yu's side won't work!

Upon hearing this, Wujie felt a bit regretful. "What a pity. It's been six thousand years since we last fought. Blood Shadow, to be honest, if we go to battle now, do we still have the blood courage from six thousand years ago?"

He actually wanted to train too!

Especially seeing the fierce battle over there, with both sides engaging in close combat, it was much more thrilling than those who fought with the power of laws.

Such a battle was very much to his taste.

Unfortunately... that was on Su Yu's side.

His Majesty chose the Sin Clan's side, and here, all the Heavenly Venerables and Heavenly Kings have been defeated. Using the same method here is impossible, and besides, the Sin Clan wouldn't agree.

At this moment, in the depths of the Control King's domain, Moon Battle's voice was icy. "Moon Luo, Moon Howl, you dare return!"

These two traitors had actually come back!

Moon Luo chuckled softly. "Calm your anger, Ancestor! His Majesty's intention is for us to merely observe, to prevent Su Yu and the Myriad Races from affecting you... Please don't mind us! Su Yu has set a three-month period, and Control Green Supreme and Granny Dragon Supreme have just emerged from the Gate of Hell, consuming a lot of energy. Are you really going to start a war with us now?"

Moon Battle's face was cold!

Moon Luo smiled charmingly. "So, Ancestor, why not watch Su Yu and the Myriad Races' duel of generals together? It's been many years since we've seen such an exciting battle. I remember the last time was tens of thousands of years ago..."

Such duels of generals had happened before.

Even the fifth Human Lord personally participated, but unfortunately, at that time, the Human Race's generals were no match for the Myriad Races, resulting in heavy casualties. After the fifth Human Lord, duels of generals were no longer conducted.

Because both sides suffered heavy losses!

These one-on-one life-and-death battles were the easiest to determine life and death.

...

In the depths of the Control King's domain, before the Gate of Hell.

At this moment, Granny Dragon Beast had completely emerged.

His massive body twisted, still bearing some injuries. His enormous pupils looked into the distance, coldly laughing. "They're all just ants!"

To him, these people were too weak.

Dueling generals was just a joke.

He looked at Control Green, speaking coldly. "Ignore them. I just came out and need a few days to recover. Once I'm recovered, I'll deal with them!"

Control Green nodded slightly. "Granny Dragon, don't be careless!"

"I won't!"

Granny Dragon spoke coldly. "I was born from chaos, experienced countless battles, how could I be careless! But that little thing, Su Yu, I must kill him!"

As he spoke, he looked into the depths of chaos, his expression suddenly changing.

The next moment, a golden-armored giant stepped through the air, with a hint of curiosity and confusion, staring at him. Suddenly, he spoke, "Granny Dragon?"

Granny Dragon Beast was startled!

"It's you?"

They recognized each other from a distance!

And from afar, the giant also recognized Granny Dragon. "You're not dead yet? Damn, you really know how to survive. I saw you come out in the ancient times, and you're still not dead. Those Taishan guys are really useless..."

He cursed the Martial King!

Now, he habitually cursed the Martial King, knowing the Martial King couldn't hear him anyway.

He glanced at the distant battle, then at Granny Dragon's side, and finally at Wujie and his group. He seemed to recognize Wujie, glanced at him, and sneered, "Following that Hundred Battle idiot, you're an idiot too. If a warrior seeks someone to follow, they shouldn't follow an idiot like Hundred Battle... Find someone reliable, fool!"

After cursing for a while, he continued, "Where's that Zhou Ji? I can't find him!"

Strange!

Wasn't Zhou Ji supposed to be powerful?

Where was he?

"I searched in chaos for a day, and there's no sign of him. Did Su Yu trick me?"

The Martial Emperor cursed, then shouted, "Wujie, you're with Hundred Battle. Tell me, where's Zhou Ji?"

As for Granny Dragon Beast... he couldn't be bothered.

Can't fight!

Only if Su Yu says to fight, then I'll fight. If I kill him, it counts as a quota.

There aren't many rulers of laws in the Myriad Realms now!

If I kill one for nothing, and Su Yu doesn't acknowledge it, wouldn't that be a loss?

As for Zhou Ji... he thought, maybe it's better not to kill him, just gauge his strength first.

He's very shrewd with calculations now. Fighting rulers of laws, he can't kill them. Even if he does, he has to tell Su Yu, it counts as a quota, this is fighting his own battle, Su Yu pays!

Otherwise, with so few rulers of laws, if a few more die, and they die for nothing, will you really make me fight the Human Emperor?

If I could beat him, I would have done it long ago!

Wujie looked solemn, gazing at the Martial Emperor. After a long pause, he said, "I don't know!"

"Hmph!"

The Martial Emperor snorted coldly, shaking people's hearts, causing Wujie and his companions to turn pale. He said coldly, "A bunch of little bugs, playing tricks with me? When my Heaven Gate opens, I know you're lying! You think you can fool me? Killing rulers of laws isn't worth it, but killing you... I can do it for free!"

"My patience is limited, don't force me to kill you now!"

With that, his figure instantly appeared before them, moving with incredible speed, completely unafraid of the six Heavenly Venerables. Even though these few weren't weak, he wasn't afraid!

Logically, these six could fight him, otherwise, Hundred Battle wouldn't dare send them here.

But... the Martial Emperor didn't care.

A bunch of idiots, am I supposed to be afraid?

I'm not even afraid of the Martial King... a bit afraid of the Culture King.

Scholars are all insidious!

These few here, you can tell they haven't read much, either wearing armor or martial robes, none in white robes, what am I afraid of?

Moon Luo quickly smiled, appearing weak. "Martial Emperor senior..."

"Ugly woman, get lost!"

The Martial Emperor suddenly roared, punching her away. Moon Luo flew out of sight!

The Martial Emperor snorted coldly. "Ugly people cause trouble! You dare influence my path, disgusting! One punch didn't kill you, you do have some skill!"

With that, he looked at Wujie. Wujie's face changed slightly. "His Highness Ji is in the depths of chaos. I don't know exactly where. If I knew, I would have said!"

"Smart!"

The Martial Emperor nodded slightly, then looked at Red Moon, frowning slightly. "Why are all of Hundred Battle's subordinates ugly? No wonder they can't beat Su Yu. Su Yu's subordinates are mostly men, but I've seen several women on Hundred Battle's side..."

Shaking his head, the Martial Emperor seemed disdainful, stepping through the air, not bothering with these guys, just a bunch of bugs!

In the distance, Control Green and Granny Dragon both looked solemn.

The Martial Emperor was very strong!

Fortunately, the Martial Emperor didn't seem interested in fighting them, leaving directly, which was somewhat unexpected.

And after the Martial Emperor left for a moment, Moon Luo returned, covered in blood, hair disheveled, panting, blood still oozing from her mouth. She coughed blood, laughing somewhat maniacally. "Martial Emperor... Martial Emperor... he dared to humiliate me like this!"

The Martial Emperor was too strong!

She had just spoken when he punched her away, severely injuring her. If he hadn't been too lazy to pursue, another punch might have killed her!

These people are all mad!

Moon Luo's eyes were full of resentment!

A bunch of madmen!

Su Yu is like this, the Martial Emperor is like this, the Giant Axe is like this... a crazy bunch!

Her usually successful charm was completely useless against these madmen.

At this moment, Red Moon frowned slightly. "Enough! Don't provoke the Martial Emperor easily. Moon Luo, you're too bold, using charm on him, are you courting death?"

Moon Luo didn't think. The Martial Emperor isn't so easily charmed.

These warriors are pure in their martial path!

Women are just embellishments to them, and female allure is just fleeting clouds. Besides, the Martial Emperor doesn't even like your type, thinks you're ugly, and you still try to charm him, isn't that disgusting to them?

Being punched away, there's no sympathy.

Not dying is already lucky.

The Martial Emperor is now the number one in the Myriad Realms, and that's not an exaggeration.

...

They were still talking, when in the distance, before the Human Mountain, a thunderous boom echoed.

The next moment, a figure was sent flying backward, countless long hairs shooting out and exploding in all directions. Heavendoom turned and ran, instantly retreating to the Human Realm's camp, his body drenched in blood, yet he laughed heartily, "I won!"

"......"

Silence reigned.

The myriad races were speechless, and so were the humans.

In the distance, the Immortal Battle Marquis was also covered in blood, though his aura remained relatively stable. At this moment, his expression shifted slightly, "You won?"

Heavendoom laughed loudly, "Of course! I'm a newly advanced second-tier Daofuse, and I managed to blow your pants off, you Heavenly King. If I didn't win, then who did? Useless! Give me a few days, and once I've healed, we'll fight again!"

With that, he ran to the rear to heal his injuries.

No death match!

Of course not, he couldn't kill a Heavenly King. Why fight to the death? I'll heal up and fight again later; it's exhilarating!

Fight like mad, unleash everything, win and kill, lose and run!

As for the Immortal Battle Marquis, his face was dark, and he said nothing more, retreating to the Human Mountain.

Did Heavendoom win?

It sounded shameless, but... if you really think about it, Heavendoom did win!

He was a second-tier Daofuse, fighting the Immortal Battle Marquis, and managed to escape without severe injuries. Moreover, the Immortal Battle Marquis was injured too. The key point was, Heavendoom was using him to sharpen his skills!

Towards the end, Heavendoom's combat experience had clearly improved.

He was quickly adapting to the battles at his current power level!

That was the terrifying part!

At this moment, as the Immortal Battle Marquis returned, he murmured almost inaudibly, "Fighting generals... is not a good choice!"

They were feeding each other moves!

Tiangu and the others were bitter. We know, but... we have no choice!
