Chapter 765: Adding Drama to the Scene (10,000 Words Requesting Subscription)

In the River of Time and Space, Su Yu wandered with the Hou Pseudo Emperor, seeking a path.

"Choose whichever path you feel suits you best," Su Yu advised. "It doesn't matter if it's occupied or not."

As they strolled through the river, Su Yu, curious, asked, "Hou Pseudo Emperor, do you mind sharing about your father?"

After all, as his mount, there might be things the Hou Pseudo Emperor preferred not to discuss.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor, however, was indifferent. "Emperor Yu, there's nothing to worry about. My father was the mount of the Martial King, known throughout the Myriad Realms! In that era, the Martial King was the third most powerful in the world. Although my father was a master of the power of laws, serving as the mount of the third most powerful was an honor, not a disgrace."

The third most powerful in the world? Perhaps.

Seeing that he didn't mind, Su Yu smiled. "When the Martial King left, did your father go with him?"

"No," the Hou Pseudo Emperor recalled. "The Martial King left with the Culture King. Shortly after the Culture King disappeared, the Martial King followed. At that time, my father was still around. It wasn't until the Human Emperor convened the Myriad Race Conference that my father left..."

He paused, then added, "Before leaving, my father might have guessed something. He advised me to close our realm after he left."

"My father had a residence on the eighth level. Initially, I lived there too, but before the conference, he told me to leave... I don't know if the Human Emperor informed him or if he figured it out himself."

Previously, he thought it might have been the Human Emperor who informed him, but now, with Su Yu saying his father was a wise general, it was uncertain.

Su Yu nodded slightly, pondering. "Did the Martial King leave any instructions when he departed?"

He was curious if there was any knowledge about the Heaven Gate.

The Culture King might have gone inside the Heaven Gate. If an era was sealed there, it could be the era of the Opening of Heaven, which inevitably involved the master of the Time Dao and the master of the Death Dao!

One existed at the beginning of the Opening of Heaven, the other at the end!

Strictly speaking, the Human Ancestor might have existed in the same era as the master of the Death Dao, both at the end of the Opening of Heaven.

After that came the Primordial Era.

But the Human Ancestor appeared in the Primordial Era, so could he exist within the Heaven Gate?

These were things Su Yu was interested in.

Chasing the footsteps of the strong, even though Su Yu was still weak, didn't stop him from seeking the traces of the powerful. Perhaps, back in the day, the Time Sage and others had the same thought.

In any era, when someone reaches the peak, they surely want to seek out those legends and myths.

Su Yu was no exception!

"Instructions?" The Hou Pseudo Emperor thought for a moment, then shook his head. "The Martial King was a level above me, so I'm not too clear on any instructions. Even if there were, they were probably given to my father. However, my father didn't leave anything behind... During the millennium of the Martial King's disappearance, my father often said, 'Among the myriad paths, martial is the purest!'"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Was that in the Human language or the common language?"

"The Human language. At that time, it was common to use the Human language."

Su Yu squinted. "Are you sure it wasn't 'martial is the dumbest'?"

"..." The Hou Pseudo Emperor was embarrassed. "That can't be. My father wouldn't insult the Martial King."

How should I respond to that?

Su Yu, however, seemed thoughtful. "Maybe he really was insulting the Martial King! The Culture King left, and he knew what he was doing. He left to save his sister, which was understandable. But with the Martial King, Radiant King, and the Human Emperor around, I doubt anything would have happened."

"Moreover, when the Culture King left... would he have left with great fanfare?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "From what I understand of the Culture King, even if he left, he would have done so quietly, leaving people guessing, unsure if he was in seclusion. If the Culture King was in seclusion and didn't appear, no one would dare act rashly. Only the Martial King, with his flamboyant nature, would make it obvious once he left... and everyone would know."

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was slightly taken aback.

Su Yu sighed. "Perhaps 'martial is the dumbest' was your father's true thought! The Culture King's disappearance was likely exposed by the Martial King! Then the Martial King also left, and with both the Culture King and Martial King gone, it's no wonder the myriad races had second thoughts!"

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was embarrassed. "That... can't be, right?"

Su Yu laughed. "You lived through that era. Let me ask you, when the Culture King disappeared, did everyone know?"

"Well..." The Hou Pseudo Emperor fell into deep thought. After a long while, he said, "It seems... it wasn't clear at first! When exactly it spread..."

He thought carefully, then was embarrassed. "It seems... it was after the Martial King left? The Martial King seemed to have had an outburst in the great hall, saying the Human Emperor wasn't being fair... something like that. Then he disappeared!"

"Not long after, the news of the Culture King's disappearance spread."

"Apparently, it was because the Culture King disappeared, and the Martial King wanted the Human Emperor to look for him. The Human Emperor might have ignored him... so he went to look himself."

Su Yu laughed and shook his head. "If I were the Human Emperor, I'd be furious!"

Truly furious.

The Human Emperor probably knew the Culture King went to the Heaven Gate, but he couldn't leave. At that time, the plan to unite the myriad races wasn't complete, and the Opening of Heaven hadn't been achieved. He definitely couldn't leave.

If he left, that would be a real disaster!

As a result, he kept the Culture King's disappearance a secret. The Martial King got anxious, thinking the Human Emperor wasn't being fair. They helped him conquer the world, and now that he had it, he changed his mind!

Now that Old Wen disappeared, he wasn't worried or looking for him!

Fine, if you won't look, I will!

And in looking... trouble arose!

Su Yu sympathized with the Human Emperor. "The Human Emperor is truly pitiful!"

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was puzzled. "Aren't the Culture King and Martial King more pitiful?"

"You..."

Your line of thinking... forget it, it's hopeless, just give up!

Su Yu felt exhausted.

He sympathized with the Human Emperor again. With these guys around, no wonder he was unlucky. Indeed, having pig teammates can be terrifying.

"Hopefully, it's not another Hundred Battle..."

Su Yu silently hoped. From the legends, the Martial King was truly reckless. It wasn't that he lacked talent or didn't want to use his brain, but he was surrounded by extremely intelligent individuals.

The Human Emperor, Culture King, Control King, Radiant King, according to legends, were all extremely wise.

With these people around, everything was arranged perfectly for the Martial King. He didn't need to think much, just fight. Why bother thinking?

As a result, the Martial King probably didn't bother thinking much.

He only knew the Culture King was his brother. When his brother was in trouble, and his brother's sister was in trouble, he naturally had to save them immediately!

Loyal... but it caused great trouble for the Human Emperor.

As they walked and talked, Su Yu suddenly stopped, looking at a tributary of the river, sensing some devouring power. He asked, "Do you feel anything special here?"

"No!" The Hou Pseudo Emperor shook his head.

Su Yu didn't mind and continued walking.

After a while, he asked again, but it was always a no.

Because his path wasn't severed yet, unless it was a particularly matching path, he wouldn't feel much. Su Yu wasn't surprised by this.

They walked and stopped, and soon reached another tributary.

This time, without Su Yu asking, the Hou Pseudo Emperor suddenly moved slightly. "I feel something here!"

He had already fused with one path, and now felt something again, indicating this path was quite suitable for him!

Su Yu looked to the side and smiled.

The sense was accurate; it was indeed a powerful devouring path.

The path was quite wide, about two thousand meters, slightly weaker than the Desolate Beast's path, but not by much. Clearly, if this path had a master, the master would be quite powerful.

However, even if there was a master now, they couldn't return.

Su Yu smiled. "This path is good. You've already fused with the Hou Race's path and can still sense this one, indicating a high compatibility!"

The Hou Pseudo Emperor felt a bit sad. "Does this mean I chose the wrong path to fuse with?"

"Then my father's path... won't be inherited by anyone?"

Su Yu laughed. "If your father isn't dead, what does inheriting it matter? You can't become the next master of the power of laws unless you patricide! But with someone else's devouring path, if you're unfamiliar or they're an enemy, killing them is enough to hope for promotion to master of the power of laws!"

Thinking this way, the Hou Pseudo Emperor nodded. Although he never thought of becoming a master of the power of laws, since Emperor Yu said so, he might as well believe it.

Su Yu glanced at the path, then suddenly smiled. "Hou Pseudo Emperor, how about we play something interesting?"

"What?"

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "You need to sever your previous path first! Severing it quietly is a waste, not fun! Let me take you for some fun and let the Myriad Realms watch a show!"

The Hou Pseudo Emperor didn't quite understand, but maybe he did a little. For a moment, he didn't know what to say.

...

Myriad Realms.

Allheaven Battlefield.

With Su Yu's recent withdrawal, the Myriad Realms had returned to peace. This time, it was truly peaceful because the human army attacking the Myriad Realms had retreated, so now there was truly no war among the myriad races.

And at this moment, a roar echoed through the heavens.

"Su Yu, you act against the natural order. My Hou Race is irreconcilable with you! You were defeated in the Upper Realm, barely surviving... and now you want to force my race to serve you? Why should we follow you to the Death Realm?"

The roar echoed through the heavens!

A colossal Hou Pseudo Emperor, with an aura immensely powerful, blocked out the sky.

At this moment, many realms in the Myriad Realms trembled.

And at this moment, Su Yu's figure appeared, coldly saying, "I said, even if I'm defeated, you can't resist! The God, Immortal, and Demon races haven't spoken, yet you dare to rebel... courting death!"

Boom!

A loud explosion sounded, and the next moment, the path shattered!

A giant hand, covering the sky, descended.

"Su Yu!"

The Hou Pseudo Emperor's desperate roar echoed through the clouds, "Your subordinates are almost all dead. Even if you kill me... what can you do? You'll die sooner or later, I'll be waiting for you!"

Boom!

The sound of an explosion rang out!

The Great Dao shattered, releasing a formidable power of laws. The connection with the Hou Realm's Great Dao was severed, causing the realm to tremble violently. In the next moment, a blood cloud descended, and Su Yu held in his hand what seemed to be sixty council tokens, summoning the blood cloud to fall!

Blood rain poured down instantly!

With a cold snort, Su Yu declared, "The Hou Race defies orders and harbors treacherous intentions. They must be exterminated! Men, annihilate the ancient Hou Race!"

Amidst the confusion of the myriad realms' experts, a thunderous roar erupted, causing the entire Hou Realm to quake violently.

Su Yu, walking through the air, approached the Hou Realm. As he arrived, the blood cloud gathered once more, and with a flip of the council tokens in his hand, the entire Hou Realm was shrouded in the blood cloud!

With a thunderous shout, Su Yu proclaimed, "Today, the Hou Race shall be exterminated! Let this serve as a warning to all races! What if I, Su Yu, have been defeated? Dealing with you is still a simple task! Until I completely disappear, you will all behave like obedient grandchildren! From this day forth, no one from the myriad races is allowed to leave their realms. Those who defy this order... will be killed!"

The word "kill" reverberated through the heavens and earth.

Accompanied by a massive blood cloud and the overflowing power of laws, the Hou Race seemed to have been completely annihilated!

At this moment, the four corners of the world trembled.

...

In the Immortal Realm.

Tiangu's expression changed slightly. What madness was this?

How did the Hou Race suddenly get exterminated?

He quickly probed, sensing the power of the Great Dao, and his expression changed again. It was true; the Hou Pseudo Emperor had been slain!

This... was unbelievable!

Does this mean the Hou Race has been wiped out?

...

In the Ancient Giant Realm.

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King also wore a heavy expression. "He's gone mad! Even though he's been defeated, at this moment, he remains the emperor of the myriad realms. Anyone who dares defy him will die!"

The three major races dared not provoke Su Yu at this time.

Even though rumors said Su Yu was defeated in the Upper Realm and suffered heavy losses.

The Hou Race, which had been one of the early supporters of Su Yu, was exterminated just because they refused to retreat with him. Annihilated!

Beside the Ancient Giant King, a shadowy figure appeared, carrying a hint of solemnity. "He's so reckless... Indeed, being invincible in battle breeds arrogance. One defeat, and he's completely unbalanced! This person... is not to be provoked now!"

Last time, Su Yu forced the Ancient Giant Race to hand over four council tokens, which left them displeased.

Now... forget it.

This guy has completely lost it.

The Hou Race, which supported him, was exterminated just because they refused to retreat with him!

And at this moment, Su Yu's somewhat crazed, somewhat arrogant voice once again echoed through the myriad realms!

"Listen well, I will return sooner or later. Be careful, and behave yourselves! I'm going to the Death Realm to proclaim myself emperor, but... the Death Realm can also open your realm passages!"

"Hahaha!"

"Remember, from now on, the Death Realm is mine! And in each realm, if there's too much death aura, I will lock onto your positions!"

"I will lock onto your realm positions, find your existence, just like I exterminated the Dragon, Phoenix, Ape, and Kunpeng realms, hahaha! You fools will always be the lowest of the low!"

"......"

These words echoed in all directions!

Instantly, they caused a tremor across the myriad realms.

What?

The four great realms were exterminated?

How is that possible!

Didn't see Su Yu attacking the four great realms... wait, what did Su Yu say?

He attacked from the Death Realm?

No wonder there was no commotion!

And at this moment, the four great realms were utterly silent.

Suddenly, the faces of the four corners changed.

...

In the Immortal Realm.

Tiangu's face also changed. Su Yu attacked from the Death Realm, and the target was the death aura!

His expression shifted slightly, and in the next moment, he roared, "Someone, destroy all the death aura within the Immortal Realm!"

Madness!

He almost forgot about this. Yes, Su Yu had plunged the Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm, clearly intending to dominate the Death Realm. However, death aura can open passages.

He knew Su Yu's intention to make a grand display. Will you destroy the death aura or not?

If not, I can lock onto you at any time, open a passage, and invade your realm!

Clearly, Su Yu wanted to destroy all the death aura in the myriad realms, preventing others from entering the Death Realm.

But... you have to destroy it.

This madman might really lock onto realm positions based on the death aura and bring a massive army of undead to attack from the Death Realm!

Indeed, at this moment, Su Yu laughed maniacally, "Come, search for the death aura positions, lock onto each realm, identify the death aura corresponding to each realm! Hahaha... I want to see who is hiding a large amount of death aura?"

With a wave of his hand, the void cracked open, and a multitude of undead appeared.

Among them, the death aura of the South King shook the heavens and earth.

No need for further words, in the next moment, the South King coldly commanded, "All soldiers, heed my order, search for the death aura, remember the aura, identify the realms, do not disrupt the order of the myriad realms, be cautious of the rules' punishment..."

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Don't worry, I control sixty council tokens, enough to suppress the rules' punishment. Generals, search for me!"

Boom!

One after another, powerful undead auras surged.

At this moment, the myriad races were truly shaken.

Undead!

Countless undead!

Moreover, among them were dozens of Daofuse Realm auras.

Too terrifying.

...

"Hurry, consume Heavenly Source Qi and source qi, destroy the death aura!"

At this moment, in each realm, countless experts shouted frantically.

Hurry!

Collecting death aura wasn't something done by just one or two people; many had actually collected some death aura to open the Death Realm passage... although it might not be of much use.

Back when the ancient cities existed, death aura permeated them, making it easy to collect.

The Immortal Race, the God Race, and some major races often used death aura to open passages to the Death Realm, sending people down to communicate with powerful undead.

The Talisman King had gone several times and even sought out the East Heavenly King.

And at this moment, everyone was terrified.

Destroy the death aura!

This thing cannot be left.

The undead are naturally extremely sensitive to death aura!

Once targeted, they can really break out from the Death Realm, and you wouldn't even know how you died.

...

The Immortal Realm was destroying it, the God Realm was destroying it, and so was the Devil Realm.

Even though the three major races knew this might be Su Yu's scheme, he just didn't want people to hide death aura, but... what can you do if you know?

Aren't you afraid?

Once the undead passage opens within your realm, and tens of millions or even billions of undead armies invade, what will be the outcome?

Opening a small passage and colluding with the undead is fine.

But opening a large passage, causing the entire Death Realm to invade... that's no joke!

...

Above the Hou Realm.

Su Yu chuckled, quite satisfied.

Some potential threats were resolved, exterminating the Hou Race was actually for the sake of the Hou Race in the Upper Realm. The Hou Race was too weak in the Upper Realm, with only one second-tier Daofuse expert. If the Hou Race really followed him, and the news leaked, the Upper Realm wouldn't dare to deal with the Iron Devourer, Space, or Five Elemental Races, so naturally, they'd settle accounts with the Hou Race!

Exterminating the Hou Race was not regrettable.

Just one second-tier Daofuse expert, would the Upper Realm really fear the Hou Race?

Killing one to warn a hundred, of course, exterminating the Hou Race was more cost-effective.

As for whether the act was convincing... does it matter?

It doesn't matter!

The rules of the Great Dao shattered, phenomena appeared, this was a fact, the Hou Race was exterminated, not a single one left, sprinkle some blood and flesh, and this realm was empty!

At this moment, would the myriad races have the nerve to deal with the Hou Race's people in the Upper Realm?

Along with that, the death aura was also worn away.

To prevent some people from trying to open the Death Realm.

Even if they hide a little now, it won't be much.

Without the 36 ancient cities, these guys would find it hard to collect death aura, hard to collect enough to support strong individuals entering the Death Realm to open a passage, maybe some death aura remains.

But without enough death aura, even if a passage is opened, allowing some weak individuals to enter is fine, but strong ones shouldn't expect it.

And weak individuals entering the Death Realm, well, they can just wait to die!

From now on, the Death Realm will be truly difficult to open.

Of course, Marquis Zhennan has quite a bit.

But Su Yu thinks, this guy won't use it. If he does, it's nothing more than two possibilities: one is to summon Su Yu to deal with Hundred Battle, the other is to summon Hundred Battle to deal with Su Yu... if Hundred Battle dares to come to the Death Realm, Su Yu will have a good show for him!

At this moment, each realm was destroying the death aura.

This thing, Heavenly Source Qi can wear it away.

And the South King was collecting the death aura emitted by the soldiers, not leaving a trace for these guys.

Su Yu waited for a while, and after a while, a group of Daofuse experts returned, the South King smiled, "Unless hidden extremely deep, almost all have been worn away by them, the death aura sensed within the three major realms is not very strong, most likely they have also worn away the death aura!"

Su Yu also smiled, "These guys are also afraid that I might go crazy at this moment, really break through the realms from within, and bring the undead to invade... they would cry too!"

"Everyone, return!"

The South King didn't say much, quickly leading the undead away through the passage Su Yu opened.

Su Yu extracted the death aura, sealing the passage.

And Su Yu, with an ostentatious smile, arrogantly declared, "A bunch of cowards! I thought you dared to keep the death aura, gamble that I can't open the Death Realm, but in the end, you chickened out so quickly?"

"A bunch of trash!"

"Hahaha!"

With laughter, Su Yu disappeared.

...

In the Ancient Giant Realm.

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King sighed, "So arrogant... but being so arrogant may not be a good thing! He can't stay in the Death Realm forever, now he's leaving, being so arrogant, is it really wise?"

Su Yu isn't going to stay there forever, unless he really waits to die in the Death Realm.

Beside him, the shadowy figure spoke softly, "It's also good, with such a commotion before leaving, the myriad races dare not make any moves! When His Majesty returns, he doesn't need to make a grand entrance, being low-key is also good!"

With Su Yu causing such a ruckus, the Upper Realm won't open, who dares to act rashly?

Su Yu isn't unable to come out, even if he seals the Death Realm, others can't enter, he surely left himself a passage out.

Advance and retreat, Su Yu's deterrence is still there.

By then, even the three major races will be low-key.

No matter where Su Yu is, as long as he's alive, all races will fear him.

The Ancient Giant King nodded slightly, saying no more.

Just a bit emotional, Su Yu truly is a remarkable person!

If fate had been kinder, if this fellow hadn't rushed off to the Upper Realm to fight, perhaps... he might have truly made a name for himself in the Lower Realm. Give him a few more years, maybe a decade, and he might have dominated a region!

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King felt relieved that Su Yu had been defeated. Otherwise, if His Majesty returned, Su Yu might have become an obstacle. This guy was no pushover, with a vengeful nature!

Thinking of this, he suddenly said, "If His Majesty returns, Su Yu won't be content with just giving up the Human Realm. We must be cautious of his retaliation!"

"Him?" A shadowy figure chuckled, "Retaliate against His Majesty? That's courting death..."

"Don't underestimate him!" The Ancient Giant King frowned slightly, speaking in a muffled voice, "Even in defeat, he still controls the Death Realm. You saw it just now, a large number of powerful undead serve him! Even if he retreats from the Myriad Realms, he remains the overlord of the Death Realm... Wasn't one of the Four Heavenly Kings just here? The Death Realm, though harsh, is a strategic stronghold... Don't underestimate Su Yu!"

The Ancient Giant King, having witnessed much, felt compelled to remind them. This one was not to be trifled with. He worried that one day Su Yu might suddenly emerge from the Death Realm, which would be a huge problem!

...

At this moment, Su Yu was unconcerned with such matters.

In the River of Time.

Su Yu held the weakened Hou Pseudo Emperor, smiling, "Wasn't that fun?"

"..." The Hou Pseudo Emperor wanted to cry. Too much fun! So much fun it was terrifying! He almost thought Su Yu would really kill him, but fortunately, he survived!

Still, he expressed his gratitude, "Thank you, Emperor Yu, for your care!"

This performance had indeed provided the Hou Race, especially those in the Upper Realm, with a bit more security.

Su Yu laughed, "It's nothing, just a small matter. I'll try to break the sky of the Upper Realm before the myriad races even realize you're alive!"

The Hou Pseudo Emperor laughed, "I believe Emperor Yu can do it!"

Su Yu gave him a strong impression! With a wave of his hand, the world turned upside down. Just now, with a casual move, he killed a Daofuse Realm expert, summoned undead powerhouses, and the myriad races immediately dissipated their death energy. If he hadn't killed the Hou Pseudo Emperor, just threatening them directly wouldn't have scared them.

Su Yu also laughed, soon leading the Hou Pseudo Emperor into the newly discovered Devouring Great Dao. He waited outside, waiting for the Hou Pseudo Emperor to merge with this new path.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor had been immersed in the Devouring Great Dao for many years, and even though he had taken the wrong path, he had reached the third-tier Daofuse Realm. Su Yu thought that if he continued, he might even create a Devouring Great Dao of his own!

Inside the Devouring Great Dao, there was a slight tremor.

Su Yu waited for quite a while before the Hou Pseudo Emperor emerged from the Devouring Great Dao. His aura wasn't particularly strong. He was still at the third-tier Daofuse Realm! However, Su Yu's eyes lit up, and so did the Hou Pseudo Emperor's!

His strength hadn't changed. But don't forget, he had just severed his path and was now merging with a new one. The fact that he instantly reached the third-tier Daofuse Realm meant something significant.

It meant that his previous insights were indeed aligned with the Devouring Great Dao. His understanding of the Devouring Path was profound. This time, he had truly found the right path.

At this moment, the Hou Pseudo Emperor was sincerely convinced, "Your Majesty, I truly took the wrong path! Our race's path... is indeed not the Devouring Path!"

He spoke with a wry smile, "So my father wasn't a Devouring Path expert, but I am!"

He was bitter, "I was misled by my father... But... But I had been comprehending the Devouring Path for a long time, and my father never warned me!"

He was speechless! I didn't know, but my father surely did, right? Why didn't he warn me later? Even when I was merging with the path, he didn't intervene?

Regarding this, Su Yu was also puzzled, "Was your father still around when you were merging with the path?"

"He was!" The Hou Pseudo Emperor said bitterly, "I was merging with the path until I reached the ninth stage of the Eternal Realm, and only then did my father leave! The Eternal Realm is also the path-merging stage. My father knew I was merging with his path. Why didn't he warn me? I started merging with the Devouring Path from the beginning! No wonder it was so difficult for me to merge with the path back then. It was only with my father's help that I succeeded!"

I thought my talent was really lacking! Among a group of second-generation martial artists, I was often ridiculed. Everyone else, descendants of the rulers of laws, had long since reached the Daofuse Realm, while I was still merging with the path. Others had become Heavenly Kings, and I was still merging with the path. How could I not be ridiculed?

But now, he had just smoothly merged with the Devouring Path! If he had merged with the Devouring Path earlier, he might have become a Heavenly King or even a Heavenly Sovereign by now!

You know, how many of the current group are sons of the rulers of laws?

Su Yu thought for a moment and shook his head, "I can't figure it out. Maybe... your father wanted you to realize it yourself?"

That's a possibility. Some people are like that, speaking in riddles, claiming it's for you to understand on your own! The problem is, once you get stuck in a rut, it's not easy to get out.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor didn't dwell on it. He quickly smiled, "This time, I know I was wrong! Then our Hou Race... forget it, let's follow the Devouring Path! I'll leave my father's path to him! When I return, I'll urge everyone to change paths... Your Majesty, give me some time. I think I can become a Heavenly King too!"

There are still second and third chances! Watching Su Yu open the path, observing the map of the Great Dao, last time he watched, but it was in vain. This time, he had truly embarked on the Devouring Path, and he might gain significant insights.

Su Yu also smiled, "The hope is great! You're different from others. You were previously limited by the wrong path, just like Doubao's mistaken insights. Once Doubao realized, he instantly stepped into the Heavenly King realm... You also have the hope of becoming a Heavenly King!"

In this way, there would be another Heavenly King-level powerhouse. And in the Upper Realm, Su Yu also had allies. March and Giant Bamboo, one Heavenly Sovereign, one Heavenly King. As for Wuming's side, it's unclear how his relationship with Destiny Marquis is, but the Space Beast Emperor's partner, the Splitting Sky Marquis, is likely to be secured.

Counting this way, Su Yu, although lacking in Heavenly Sovereigns, wasn't weak in the Heavenly King level and other domains. Even if not as strong as the Myriad Races and the Chaos Race, he might not be weaker than Hundred Battle's forces.

"We're only missing a truly top-tier existence!" Su Yu murmured, like Hundred Battle, the Chaos Race's ancestor, or the Sunmoon Heavenly Sovereigns among the Myriad Races. If there was such an existence, the strength gap wouldn't be too large.

And this candidate... still depends on me! If I succeed in opening the path this time, I wonder if I can achieve Heavenly Sovereign-level combat power.

...

In the Abyssal Realm.

Su Yu returned once more. This time, he didn't run around but chose to seclude himself for three days, to settle down, reflect on today's gains, and prepare for the upcoming path opening.

Where is the right place to open the path? Initially, it might not be possible to move one's Great Dao, so where to open it is crucial. It must be in the Land of Chaos! Although opening the path, others may not see where your Great Dao is, but what if someone can? Like the Gate of Hell and the Heaven Gate, who can guarantee those guys can't see it?

The Chaos Race has the Gate of Hell, and Hundred Battle might have the Heaven Gate.

"The heavens are divided into three layers... the Upper Realm, the Myriad Realms, the Death Realm, and beyond these three layers, it's all chaos!"

"The depths of the Land of the Abyss is chaos! The Chaos Mountain in the Upper Realm is chaos, the endless void of the Myriad Realms is chaos... the depths of the Land of the Abyss!"

Su Yu murmured, realizing he had no choice! He could only go to the depths of the Land of the Abyss! There, perhaps many powerful beings were sealed, but it couldn't be that everywhere was filled with sealed powerhouses. First, find a place with no one. Su Yu wasn't afraid of these undead powerhouses. The undead were still very limited.

"Then the location is set in the depths of the Land of the Abyss!" Su Yu thought silently, temporarily deciding on the location. As for the energy source for opening the path, he didn't plan to open any Time Great Dao portals again. The power was too strong, and his Great Dao might not withstand it. He could only rely on his own power.

"Then where is the source of power for the River of Time?" Su Yu fell into deep thought, and after a long time, suddenly thought of something: "Chaos! Yes, the River of Time, one end must be chaos! The other party converted chaotic power to provide the operation of the Time Great Dao!"

In this way, all power sources are actually still chaos. I open the path in chaos, and later, I might try to convert chaotic power. Chaotic power is the most common power source.

"The Death Great Dao and the Human Emperor's Great Dao haven't started trying to convert chaotic power, which means these two haven't thoroughly studied chaotic power, compared to the owner of the Time Great Dao, they're still lacking!"

As for Su Yu himself, naturally, he couldn't do it either, but he could treat it as a plan. During these three days, Su Yu kept thinking. He constantly improved some of his speculations, including some insights from opening the portal before.

"But, if I open the path, I might need to retrieve the pages... Other pages are fine, but should I retrieve the page of the Death Great Dao?" Su Yu fell into contemplation, and after a long time, he smiled, "No, I'll open another Death page. Let's put Dragonblood Marquis aside for now. He might still be a useful piece for me!"

Dragonblood Marquis's, temporarily not retrieved. Let this child of destiny give me some surprises. Su Yu felt that guy seemed to have already stepped into the Heavenly King realm, and his speed was extremely fast. The chaos in the Land of the Abyss might still need him to stabilize.

Bit by bit, he perfected all his plans, and three days passed in the blink of an eye.

...

"Ladies and gentlemen, come out of seclusion, follow me to the Land of the Abyss!" A low shout echoed through the Abyssal Realm. In the next moment, a group of powerhouses flew out one after another. Dozens of Daofuse, hundreds of Eternals!

This time, both Daofuse and Eternals would go. Among the group, some were excited, some worried, and some thrilled. Those worried feared Su Yu's failure in opening the path, which would be a huge problem. Those thrilled were utterly confident in Su Yu's success, like Heavendoom, who was so excited he didn't even consider the possibility of Su Yu failing!

Moments later, hundreds of powerhouses, their auras covering the sky and the sun.

Nearly ten Heavenly King-level auras swept across the Death Realm. At this moment, even the Celestial River of Death and the Land of the Abyss fell into utter silence. Not a single sound could be heard.

So many powerful beings!

Within the Luminous Domain Mansion, the Martial Emperor's phantom appeared on the seventh floor, gazing into the distance through the entrance of the death passage, his expression heavy with concern.

Are they here to kill me?

Is this the crisis I sensed earlier?

Su Yu has truly brought people to kill me!

As expected, my earlier premonitions were not wrong!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's face was grave. So many powerful beings! Numerous Heavenly Kings, top-tier Daofuse cultivators, and even hundreds of Eternals have come. To kill me, Su Yu is truly sparing no expense!

With so many powerful beings... this time... I'm afraid I'm doomed!

After all, I'm still sealed.

But even if I die, I, the Martial Emperor, will take a piece of you with me.

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's aura erupted, like a war god. His phantom suddenly appeared outside the seventh-floor passage, in the Death Realm.

The Martial Emperor's aura exploded as he roared, "Su Yu, come on! Your grandpa isn't afraid of you. Even if I die today, I won't let you have it easy!"

His roar reverberated throughout the Death Realm!

I'm not afraid of you!

Today, I will unleash a massacre!

...

On Su Yu's side, hundreds of people looked towards him, each bewildered.

What the heck?

What's Su Yu doing again?

Hasn't he been with us all along?

How did he provoke the Martial Emperor to this extent?

Su Yu, slightly frowning, glanced over there and sneered, "Is he adding drama for himself? What a boring guy!"

Truly boring!

Am I an idiot?

If I brought people to kill you, losing even one would be a huge loss for me!

He's acting like a lunatic!

"Ignore him. He's got a problem with his brain. It's not like it's the first day. He's always had issues. I thought he had sobered up, but it turns out he hasn't!"

Su Yu shook his head, feeling a bit sympathetic.

Poor guy.

Even now, his mind is still in chaos.

Truly pitiful.

...

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was furious, his hair standing on end, ready for the impending battle!

Even if this emperor dies in battle, I will not compromise, nor will I admit defeat!

However... gradually, those hundreds of auras crossed the Celestial River of Death, entered the Four Kings' Domains, and then moved towards the Land of the Abyss.

Gradually, the Martial Emperor's face turned green, then purple, then red.

Could it be... they're not here for me?

Did I... overreact?

But earlier, I truly sensed malice. Could it be that Su Yu is feigning an attack and will bring people to fight me later?

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was somewhat bewildered.

He had already prepared for battle, yet Su Yu didn't come, didn't even acknowledge him. What is this?
