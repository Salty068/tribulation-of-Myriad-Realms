Chapter 746: Cooperation Achieved

Tiance departed, a meaningful smile lingering on his face. Clearly, the mention of Changhe and Jiuyue indicated that he was aware of their whereabouts. Since Changhe had returned to the Fate Clan, what about Jiuyue?

Su Yu remained unfazed. "You may know, but I won't admit it. What can you do about it?" he thought. He didn't dwell on it further.

Now, he might have to collaborate with the myriad races. Even if discovered, he could always retreat. The myriad races might not expend significant resources to trouble him, especially with the Chaos Race still around.

Once again, he found himself at the Iron Devourer Race's base on the third level. The second level was occupied by the God, Demon, and Immortal Clans. Although one clan could have taken a better area, having one clan on the second level and the other two on the third would give the impression that the two clans on the third level were inferior. Thus, all three major clans stationed themselves on the second level.

The third level was where other races with Heavenly Sovereigns resided. The Fate Clan's territory wasn't far from the Iron Devourer Race.

At this moment, Marquis Giant Bamboo and his group were marking their territory. Seeing Su Yu return, Marquis Giant Bamboo quickly flew over and asked, "How did it go?"

"A number of powerful beings have been revived. Five human experts have awakened, and it's said that there's even a Heavenly Sovereign among them. None escaped; all were captured."

Marquis Giant Bamboo's expression shifted slightly. All captured? Indeed, being in closed-door cultivation meant they were unaware of external events. Otherwise, they would have emerged long ago. Unaware of the situation, it was difficult to escape the myriad races' sweep.

Su Yu didn't elaborate on this and quickly said, "The three major clans plan to form nine vanguard armies to act as bait... well, not exactly bait, but more like decoys. Marquis Giant Bamboo, gather as many people as possible. The more, the safer!"

Su Yu briefly explained the situation, and Marquis Giant Bamboo took it seriously. Of course, they already had a quasi-king, the fellow from the Nine-headed Bird Race. But the more, the merrier.

Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't delay and swiftly flew in another direction to recruit more experts.

At the same time, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign and others had thoroughly swept the Source of the Dao. More powerful beings surrounded them now. The five human experts were all imprisoned.

Emerging from the light curtain of the Source of the Dao, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign looked at the other Heavenly Sovereigns, including the avatars of the Nether Heavenly Sovereign and others, and said, "Let's talk."

Excluding the Dragon and Phoenix Heavenly Sovereigns, the other nine Heavenly Sovereigns had already had a long discussion. They felt it was time to talk with the Torchbearer lineage.

Of course, the Dragon Clan's Heavenly Sovereign was unaware. Otherwise, they might not agree, given that Su Yu's group nearly wiped out the Upper Realm's Dragon Clan.

The Nether Heavenly Sovereign's avatar said coldly, "We can talk, as long as they weren't behind the previous incidents. I have no objections!"

Although it was largely confirmed that the Torchbearer lineage wasn't responsible for the Nether Clan's troubles, who could say for sure that they weren't trying to divert attention?

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign nodded, "We'll verify the information. Now, we have enough leverage to negotiate properly, unlike before when we knew nothing about them. Now, with a Heavenly Sovereign, two quasi-kings, and two top-tier Daofuse experts, we can make some demands."

Previously, Su Yu and his group held the upper hand with their knowledge of the myriad races' weaknesses, including over a hundred pseudo-dao experts. Now, the situation was different.

Could the five top-tier human experts be exchanged for those pseudo-dao experts?

Dao Heavenly Sovereign, the oldest and most venerable, chuckled lightly, "Don't be too afraid. Even if they can control the pseudo-dao experts, it should be difficult. However, being targeted is a fact. Now, exploring each other's cards through cooperation is worth discussing."

Mo Heavenly Sovereign also spoke, "Then let's talk. This time, have their lineage leader come forward, even if it's just an avatar."

The group exchanged glances and nodded. Knowing who their lineage leader was would be crucial.

The next moment, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign surveyed the surroundings and suddenly shouted, "Bold scoundrel!"

The shout left some people behind him baffled. Where was the scoundrel? They saw no one!

Soon, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign soared into the sky, flying to a distant mountain. Not long after, further away, the ground was overturned, and a stone figure swiftly flew towards the Moon Heavenly Sovereign.

This scene left some people pondering its meaning.

On the mountain, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign looked at the stone figure before him, frowning slightly before relaxing. "It's just an avatar. I thought you had someone by my side. Seems not."

The stone figure, a transformation of Lantian, nodded earnestly, "No one arranged."

"......"

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign didn't want to say more. The more he said, the less at ease he felt. Forget it, he'd observe on his own.

"We want to meet your lineage leader and have a proper discussion. Last time was just an intention. This time, it's a formal negotiation before the great battle. If we can reach an agreement, we can cooperate on dealing with the Chaos lineage."

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign said calmly, "Remember, we've captured many human experts and haven't killed them. We hope you'll show some sincerity and not just empty words. We are sincere and hope you are too!"

"If we can reach an agreement, we might even release your human Heavenly Sovereign!"

Lantian's avatar quickly replied, "We will take it seriously! How about this: three days later, we'll negotiate at Dao Origin Mountain!"

"Dao Origin Mountain?" The Moon Heavenly Sovereign frowned, "Never heard of it."

"It's on the outskirts of Chaos Mountain."

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign's expression darkened.

Lantian, with a simple smile, said, "Don't worry, it's just the outskirts. We can negotiate with avatars, not necessarily the true bodies. It's not to trap you, just for safety. Dao Origin Mountain also has a sealing formation set by the Chaos Race, preventing ancient beasts from discovering us. You can see the formation's effect firsthand! Before entering Dao Origin Mountain, if you're fast enough, you can sever the connection to the Great Dao and arrive instantly!"

With that, Lantian waved his hand, presenting a map with his finger pointing to a small mountain. "Here it is, the former residence of the Human Realm's Marquis Anbei."

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign memorized the location of Dao Origin Mountain, squinting, "Are you in Chaos Mountain?"

Lantian laughed, "Some of us are, to investigate the Chaos lineage thoroughly. We rarely fight unprepared battles!"

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign frowned, then relaxed, smiling, "Alright, three days later then! This time, I hope both sides can reach an agreement... Also, the Dragon Clan has a Heavenly Sovereign revived. You should think about how to explain it to them..."

Lantian chuckled, "They were enemies to begin with. What explanation is needed? If we can't reach an agreement, that's your problem. Silencing the Dragon Clan is also your problem. The Myriad Races Council should have one voice, not a cacophony. If you can't even agree internally, your council will be the first to withdraw from this three-way struggle!"

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign gave him a deep look, said nothing more, and quickly vanished. Lantian's stone avatar also exploded instantly, leaving no trace.

Once the stone avatar exploded, several Heavenly Sovereigns appeared simultaneously. Dao Heavenly Sovereign softly said, "Interesting... This isn't an avatar technique. Perhaps any avatar can become the main body. It seems like a form of soul division... Who knows how many avatars he's divided."

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign frowned, "Can we locate his main body?"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "I said it's not an avatar technique, so there's no main body. Maybe there's a stronger avatar you can consider the main body. But killing him won't be easy! It's best to force him to gather most of his avatar's power and then strike the gathered main body. This will significantly reduce his avatar count. Afterward, find a sealed area and eliminate them one by one. Even if you can't kill him completely, you can weaken him!"

"Is he that hard to kill?"

The group frowned. Dao Heavenly Sovereign laughed, "Not necessarily!"

He then looked at Destiny Marquis, speaking softly, "Destiny Brother, use your Sky-Peering Technique to observe his fate. Even if he divides into countless avatars, the Great Dao differs, but fate remains the same. Destiny Brother might find all his avatars."

Destiny Marquis chuckled, "After severely injuring him, there's hope! Now, his avatars only have a faint trace of fate power, hidden throughout the Upper Realm. I can't see such subtle fate power. But if we severely injure him, causing a backlash in his fate, the fluctuations might allow me to find all his avatars!"

The group pondered for a moment and nodded. As long as they could deal with him, that was good.

However, Destiny might not be reliable. Besides the Sky-Peering Technique, others were also considering similar methods to deal with this guy. After all, with so many avatars, each maintaining the main body's form, it was too daunting.

"Dao Origin Mountain... quite a name! Let's meet them in three days!"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "He wasn't wrong! If the Myriad Races Council can't even agree internally, how can they compete with them? During negotiations, there should be one voice. Others can supplement opinions but not make decisions!"

He looked at everyone, "For real decision-making... leave it to the Moon Heavenly Sovereign!"

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign quickly said, "No, Dao Brother is more suitable..."

Dao Heavenly Sovereign smiled faintly, "Let the Moon Heavenly Sovereign handle it. The Immortal Clan might not be comparable to the God Clan now."

The Moon Heavenly Sovereign cursed inwardly. Roundabout as ever, just to say this?

He didn't want to dwell on it and quickly changed the subject, "Be cautious this time. If possible, don't send your true bodies. It's better to be safe."

Everyone nodded. March, with a simple expression, also nodded, though his mind was racing.

Su Yu had actually allied with these guys. What a bold move!

"Three days later, Dao Origin Mountain!"

Lan Tian reported to Su Yu, "They said they want to meet the lineage master. What should we do?"

"Where would we find a lineage master?" Su Yu pondered for a moment before smiling. "Let the Great Zhou King send a divine character avatar. If he doesn't act as the lineage master, who will? This time, both the Great Zhou King and I will only send avatars. Our true selves won't go. Once is enough; going a second time might get us caught by those guys!"

"Be careful they don't trace the avatar back to us," Lan Tian cautioned.

Su Yu nodded. "I know. I'll be careful."

Five powerful human cultivators were worth negotiating with.

Soon, a divine character avatar appeared. Su Yu handed it to Lan Tian. "Find a way to send this avatar to Dao Origin Mountain. I'll notify the Great Zhou King and have Marquis Tongtian arrange for an avatar to be sent over."

Lan Tian chuckled, "Should I pretend to be the Great Zhou King?"

"No need!" Su Yu laughed. "There has to be some truth in it. Not everything can be fake! What if someone recognizes the Great Zhou King? He knows things that neither of us might be aware of. A single careless word could arouse suspicion."

Seeing Su Yu's decision, Lan Tian said no more. Since Su Yu wasn't going in person, there was less to worry about.

...

Chaos Mountain.

Deep within the inner region, inside a cave.

The Great Zhou King and his group were in seclusion when suddenly, the Great Zhou King opened his eyes, seemingly having received a message. With a hint of exasperation, he muttered, "Truly daring!"

Su Yu actually wanted to ally with the Myriad Races!

This had never happened even in ancient times. Su Yu always liked to come up with unexpected ideas and do things that surprised everyone.

Although he knew Su Yu was playing with fire, the Great Zhou King couldn't say much. Perhaps this was the best course of action for now.

"Tongtian, send my avatar to Dao Origin Mountain first..."

The Great Zhou King instructed, then turned to the Great Ming King. "Old Zhu, stop eyeing Old Qin and Old Xia. If you really take all their bones, their strength will decline. They've just entered the second-tier Daofuse Realm; don't let them regress!"

Not far away, the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King both wore dark expressions.

The Great Ming King was truly incorrigible!

These past few days, he had almost skinned them alive!

The Great Ming King grinned, "Nothing of the sort, just friendly negotiations!"

He then added with a smile, "I wonder when Wan Tiansheng will return and if he found anything."

Wan Tiansheng had taken a formation base to explore the area. Who knew if he would discover anything? The depths were still dangerous, and the Space Ancient Beast Race had only managed to carve out a small safe zone, limited to this area.

...

Meanwhile, Wan Tiansheng was hiding on a small mountain, not alone but with the curious Fat Ball. This was Wan Tiansheng's greatest assurance; Fat Ball's strength might be comparable to theirs, but it had many valuable items.

Not to mention, the shoe from the Culture King was incredibly powerful.

With it, he felt more confident wherever he went.

Wan Tiansheng was very cautious, knowing that the Control King's lineage seemed to have methods to probe the Great Dao. He even severed his connection to the Great Dao, maintaining only a Sunmoon Realm state, which was extremely risky!

He brought Fat Ball along because it also had a technique for peering into the Great Dao. The first time Su Yu used Fat Ball's blood essence, he saw the Great Dao and its shadow, knowing where to bite through it.

This was Fat Ball's innate talent and unique trait.

At this moment, Fat Ball also severed its connection to the Great Dao, sniffed the air, wagged its tail, and said, "There are many strong beings nearby. I smell their scent. I want to bite through their Dao!"

Its dog eyes gleamed with golden light as it scanned the surroundings.

The power of the Great Dao was highly attractive to it. Biting through the Great Dao was its natural instinct.

Wan Tiansheng surveyed the area and finally focused on a high mountain beyond the Chaos Forest. There were many other peaks nearby, but from that direction, he sensed some desires.

Human desires!

Humans have emotions and desires. He could vaguely feel the joy, excitement, and various emotional forces emanating from there.

Emotions cannot be concealed.

Unlike aggressive Great Dao forces, emotions are unconsciously emitted.

No one would deliberately restrain their joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness.

After sensing for a while, Wan Tiansheng transmitted, "I sense their joy, their excitement, their murderous intent... Perhaps there are some powerful beings over there."

He glanced at the mountain from the corner of his eye. It looked no different from other mountains, and he saw no one.

But he knew there were strong beings there.

As for how many, he couldn't determine.

He didn't dare to look too long, as strong beings were very vigilant. "Senior Fat Ball, don't look too much, lest you draw attention."

Fat Ball also withdrew its gaze.

Wan Tiansheng continued, "This place is probably not their main base. The mountain isn't large, and even if it contains a hidden space, it can't hold many people. It's too close to the outer region. This might be one of their forward bases... The last time they ambushed the Nether Race's strong beings, they might have set out from here."

He made some judgments.

If so, to instantly kill two Heavenly King-level experts, there must be no shortage of strong beings here.

Wan Tiansheng slowly retreated, unable to look too much.

He couldn't get too close, lest he alert them.

Finding one of their bases was already a significant success.

However, soon, Wan Tiansheng frowned slightly.

The next moment, a surge of desire emanated from him, rushing towards Fat Ball!

Fat Ball's eyes showed fear. "What are you doing?"

What was this guy trying to do to me?

I'm just a dog!

Wan Tiansheng remained silent as the desire quickly spread over a small area. In an instant, some weak ancient beasts on the mountain were affected, and Wan Tiansheng left with the frightened Fat Ball.

Not long after they left, two figures appeared.

Silently!

They quickly arrived at the spot where Wan Tiansheng had just been. A man and a woman, both with some doubt. Earlier, Yue Hao had suddenly asked them to investigate, as if something was amiss.

However, they didn't sense anything.

At this moment, the two landed on the mountain peak, looked around, and soon saw something. On one side of the mountain, two small ancient beasts were rolling and tumbling...

The female expert frowned slightly. "Mating season? These creatures..."

Here, she even smelled the scent of desire.

So, some ancient beasts were mating here.

The woman spoke, unable to help herself, "Did Yue Hao smell these scents?"

The man's expression was peculiar, with a hint of a smile. "Maybe... perhaps!"

He looked at the woman with a strange gaze. "Do you think Yue Hao, while talking to us, still has the mind to think about these things?"

The two exchanged glances and laughed.

Forget it, as long as Yue Hao knew.

They checked other places and soon left, finding nothing unusual. It was just two ancient beasts mating. This was the inner region of Chaos Mountain; it wasn't so easy for someone to sneak in. Yue Hao was making a fuss over nothing.

Meanwhile, Wan Tiansheng, who had left, quickly retreated with Fat Ball, feeling a bit uneasy. There must be strong beings over there, possibly Heavenly Sovereign-level!

Just a moment ago, he felt a sense of crisis and hurriedly retreated, hoping not to leave any traces. If it were discovered that someone had infiltrated the inner region of Chaos Mountain, it wouldn't be good.

...

Three days can sometimes pass quickly, in the blink of an eye.

The outer region of Chaos Mountain.

Dao Origin Mountain.

At this moment, in the cave, Su Yu and the Great Zhou King's avatars had long arrived. The two were leisurely reading books. This place had some rare books left by Marquis Anbei.

As for the few Heavenly Sovereigns of the Myriad Races, Su Yu guessed they had probably arrived long ago, just not showing themselves.

Whether they came in person or sent avatars was unclear.

The two were reading when a soft laugh echoed, "You two are quite leisurely. Are you one person or two?"

Su Yu smiled, "I am Zhou Tiandao. I met Heavenly Sovereign Yue last time!"

At this moment, figures appeared at the cave entrance.

Su Yu remained calm and soon smiled, "Let me introduce you. This is the lineage master of our Torchbearer lineage, Master Zhou!"

"Perhaps some of you have met or know him."

At the cave entrance, nine figures appeared simultaneously.

Nine Heavenly Sovereigns had come!

They took this very seriously!

Of course, they were all avatars.

Su Yu saw March but didn't look much. Soon, he smiled and said, "Daoist March, Daoist Destiny, Daoist Thunderstorm, long time no see!"

"…"

The three looked at him simultaneously, and Thunderstorm grumbled, "I don't think we've met!"

Su Yu smiled, "Then let it be so!"

He said nothing more, while the Great Zhou King remained seated, looking up at them with some nostalgia. After a while, he chuckled, "It's been a long time, indeed! You are all extraordinary talents. If the ancient times hadn't perished, the nine of you would probably be rulers of the laws by now!"

With these words, Heavenly Sovereign Yue scrutinized him.

The oldest, Dao Heavenly Sovereign, examined the Great Zhou King for a while before saying, "Have we met?"

The Great Zhou King smiled and nodded, "We have. Let me think... It's been so long! About 120,000 years ago, His Majesty the Human Emperor hosted a banquet for the powerful beings of the Myriad Realms. On that day, Dao Ming Marquis seemed to have come with Immortal Saint Marquis. Immortal Saint Marquis drank too much and got into a conflict in the Human Emperor's Palace..."

The Great Zhou King reminisced, "Immortal Saint Marquis had reached the realm of a ruler of the laws, so he couldn't be punished. Coincidentally, Dao Ming Marquis was there and became the scapegoat. That day, I led the capture of Dao Ming Marquis and personally punished him, whipping his Dao body a hundred times until he cried bitterly... Does Marquis Ming remember?"

Upon hearing this, Dao Heavenly Sovereign's expression changed!

He scrutinized the Great Zhou King closely, but unfortunately, it was just an avatar here. However, he vaguely remembered!

After a long time, he said in a low voice, "It's you!"

The Great Zhou King smiled gently, "You remember?"

The man chuckled, "To the esteemed experts present, I have a minor grudge with Marquis Daoming. I hope he won't take it to heart!"

Everyone turned to look at Marquis Daoming. 

Is that true? We had no idea!

Dao Heavenly Sovereign took a deep breath and looked at the Great Zhou King. "I know who you are now!"

His voice was somewhat low. "I remember you. I even looked into you later. You were the scribe for the Human Emperor during his time in the Human Realm, drafting edicts for him... Later, when there were more experts, the Culture King took charge of major affairs, and you seemed to only handle some miscellaneous tasks in the Human Emperor's palace."

The Great Zhou King chuckled lightly, "That's about right. After all, my talent was too poor to step into the realm of the rulers of laws. The Culture King was powerful and unmatched in wisdom. I could only handle some chores."

He laughed softly, "I hope Marquis Daoming won't laugh at me. Back then, I was just following orders."

Dao Heavenly Sovereign gave him a deep look and said after a long pause, "I now understand why you are the core of the Torchbearer lineage. So... you were indeed close to the Human Emperor! Compared to you, Bingku and the others had much lower status back then..."

The Great Zhou King laughed, "You can't say that. My status wasn't high either. Bingku and Danyu were actually the real core. I was just filling in the gaps, handling some logistical work."

The eyes of several Heavenly Sovereigns showed a hint of peculiarity. They now understood that this person was truly close to the Human Emperor, having followed him since the Human Realm era.

"You're still alive!"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign said with a hint of melancholy, "You must be quite old now. How is it that your lifespan hasn't run out... You don't seem like someone who has just awakened from slumber."

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Having followed His Majesty the Human Emperor for many years, back then, the Culture King beheaded the Longevity Dao Sovereign of the Immortal Clan, refining his blood essence to create three Longevity Pills, which he presented to His Majesty. The Human Emperor, considering my age and the fact that others were rulers of laws while I had poor aptitude and no hope of reaching that realm, granted me one Longevity Pill... So I'm not worried about my lifespan running out."

Suddenly, the Desolate Heavenly Sovereign roared in anger, "You're courting death!"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "I'm just stating the facts. During the Culture King's suppression of the Immortal Clan, he indeed severed the great paths of several rulers of laws from the Immortal Clan and killed the Longevity Dao Sovereign. This isn't a secret. We should face the past openly without denial. The glory of our Human Clan in ancient times and our decline now are both facts that I never deny. Why should Marquis Desolate be angry?"

He maintained an inscrutable smile, even leaving Su Yu beside him somewhat bewildered.

Impressive!

The Great Zhou King's demeanor... sometimes one had to admit, he had the composure of a mountain, unshaken even when the sky collapsed, remaining calm despite others' anger.

Ignoring them, the Great Zhou King said with a smile, "Alright, let's sit down and talk. There's no need to get angry right away and harm our harmony."

The Heavenly Sovereigns exchanged glances and each took a seat. The large square table was more than enough for them.

"Heavenly Dao, serve tea to the Heavenly Sovereigns!"

The Great Zhou King looked at Su Yu, who wore a smile but cursed inwardly. The Great Zhou King had a penchant for mischief at times. Was he courting death?

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "Forgive me, everyone. This is my grandson. He's not very old, but I'm getting on in years. Nowadays, most of the time, the Torchbearer lineage is under his management!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign looked at Su Yu and smiled faintly, "Quite a talented young man. Last time we met, Daoist Tiandao showed great courage."

Su Yu smiled modestly, "Moon Heavenly Sovereign overpraises me."

With that, he served tea to the few of them... Well, it was just some source qi to muddle through. No one really cared. Su Yu hadn't brought anything, so where would he get tea for them?

No one minded. Drinking tea was just a pretense; discussing matters was the real purpose.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign got straight to the point, "Last time, I discussed with Daoist Tiandao. Now that the Source of the Dao has been cleared, on the Human Clan's side, Marquis Giant Axe has advanced to Heavenly Sovereign, and both Marquis Nanxi and General Xuelan have reached the quasi-king realm."

The Great Zhou King was slightly taken aback and chuckled, "General Xuelan is still alive?"

"I was surprised too."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign said blandly, "Her status isn't low. I think the lineage master should know better than us."

The Great Zhou King nodded slightly and smiled at Su Yu, "My grandson was born after the ancient era, so he probably doesn't know General Xuelan. After the conferment of 360 Human Marquis, many were not conferred later... General Xuelan has a noble status, being the daughter of the Snow King! The Snow King was one of the few female Human Kings, and General Xuelan is truly a descendant of the Human King, a direct line!"

He sighed, "But General Xuelan was quite young back then. I hadn't heard of her since. Turns out she was in seclusion. Otherwise, she could have served as a Human Lord, preventing the Human Clan from gradually falling into chaos..."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign smiled, "It's good that the lineage master knows Xuelan's identity. I'm just worried that someone might not know or value her. She might be the only direct descendant of a Human King left in the Human Clan..."

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Perhaps. If we don't count the Control King, that might indeed be the case!"

He then smiled, "Let's get straight to the point. What would it take for you to be willing to send them back?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign didn't mince words, "Unseal the Human Emperor's seal and let us step into the realm of the rulers of laws!"

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly, "This matter... isn't as simple as you say! If it were that simple, our Human Clan would have unsealed it at its peak!"

The Heavenly Sovereigns were moved. Did he really know?

The Great Zhou King spoke softly, "Unsealing it is very difficult, and it's not the right time! Not all of the Control King's lineage follows the path of chaos. There are Heavenly Sovereigns among them who cultivate other great paths... If unsealed, they would also advance!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign said blandly, "Then tell us how to unseal it. Otherwise, how would we know if it's true?"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "Actually... it's not much of a secret! There are more than one method. First, the Human Emperor falls! Second, the Human Clan is annihilated! Third, the Human Clan unifies the Myriad Realms again! Fourth, break a few core seals!"

He looked at them and smiled, "Currently, it's impossible to unseal. Let's not mention it. Even if I tell you, you can't do it."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign said in a deep voice, "Since we can't do it, why not tell us?"

The Great Zhou King laughed again, "Alright, let me briefly mention some of the core locations of these seals. First, the location of the Martial Emperor's Heaven-penetrating Aperture, the former territory of King Gong! Second, the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion, above King Yue's corpse..."

Their expressions changed slightly. Dao Heavenly Sovereign couldn't help but interject, "Martial Emperor's Heaven-penetrating Aperture, King Yue's corpse?"

The Great Zhou King sighed and nodded, "King Yue died. At the time of his death, His Majesty the Human Emperor placed one of the seal cores above his head..."

He chuckled, "No need to deceive you all. It's not necessary! Also, it's very dangerous. Even if you descend, don't think about trying! King Yue is indeed dead, but he still harbors a killing intent. Any race other than the Human Clan that approaches will surely die! Unless you are confident in withstanding a full-force strike from King Yue..."

He spoke of these secrets as if they were mere gossip overheard on the street, yet the expressions of those listening kept changing!

The more casually he spoke, the more it was worth taking seriously.

King Yue was dead! His corpse remained, and not only that, but above his corpse, there was a seal preventing them from advancing to the realm of the rulers of laws. In other words, to become a ruler of laws, one had to go to the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion and break the seal!

And there was the Martial Emperor!

That was equivalent to two rulers of laws. This... this difficulty was terrifyingly daunting.

No wonder he would directly tell them. It was indeed impossible to accomplish.

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Everyone, I have no intention of deceiving you. If you really want to try, wait until the lower realm opens. However... I think even if you all join forces, you might still fall! The Martial Emperor and King Yue are both rulers of laws. The Martial Emperor is still alive, and this is no small matter. The Martial Emperor hates the Martial King but also despises the myriad races... Consider it carefully!"

Su Yu, standing to the side, listened silently.

The Great Zhou King, this old fox!

He's setting a trap that could kill without compensation!

What he said was nine parts true and one part false.

King Yue's corpse was real, the hidden strike was real, the seal above was real, the Martial Emperor being alive was real...

But the crucial point was false. This had nothing to do with unsealing them to become rulers of laws!

He even told them about the danger, especially the hidden strike from King Yue. This was a secret, and he revealed it!

If the myriad races truly believed it, they might go to the ninth floor, see King Yue's corpse, see the spatial fluctuations above, and perhaps really try it. After all, to become a ruler of laws, some sacrifices could be made!

The Heavenly Sovereigns were digesting this information.

Mo Heavenly Sovereign said blandly, "You just told us like that?"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "If you dare to go, can kill the Martial Emperor, and withstand a strike from King Yue... then if it's unsealed, it's unsealed! But, even if the nine of you join forces, if you don't lose three to five of you, then you're underestimating the rulers of laws!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "I'd be happy for you to investigate. As for whether it's true or false, you can judge for yourselves!"

Mo Heavenly Sovereign frowned, not speaking further on this, and asked, "Did you take the lower realm?"

The Great Zhou King nodded slowly, "Sort of, but not really! To avoid alarming you, we didn't touch the three major clans. Even if we could kill them, we didn't..."

Mo Heavenly Sovereign was silent for a moment, then looked at Moon Heavenly Sovereign. Moon Heavenly Sovereign said deeply, "If you want people, you can, but exchange them for people!"

Su Yu interjected, "Are you talking about those guys from the lower realm?"

Su Yu laughed, "No way! Those guys from the lower realm know many of our secrets. If we bring them up, our secrets will be exposed! That's not acceptable. Of course, we can guarantee that if you hand over the people, we won't harm those guys from the lower realm."

"Nonsense!"

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign said coldly, "Empty words. You want us to hand over people for just a promise? Are you joking?"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "Calm down! Those people from the lower realm aren't worth worrying about. If we wanted to kill them, we would have done it long ago! We just don't want to expose too much now. You should understand a bit..."

"Moreover, once the passage to the lower realm is discovered by you, everything will be laid bare before you, which is an immense loss for us, touching upon our very foundation. Even if we don't exchange a few Human race experts, we won't agree to it!"

At this point, the Great Zhou King spoke softly, "Cooperation naturally requires some sacrifices! We are very sincere! We will directly inform you of the core formation of Chaos Mountain, rather than using formation tokens."

"That's the first point. Second, we will temporarily refrain from moving against all pseudo-dao experts, and we can even sign some rule-based agreements on this!"

"Third, in the upcoming war with the Chaos lineage, we can act as the vanguard... Once we achieve results, you can decide whether to join in!"

The Great Zhou King calmly stated, "For every Human race expert you release, we will kill an equal number of Chaos lineage experts! Life for life! If you release Marquis Giant Axe, we will exchange by killing a Heavenly Sovereign! That is our sincerity! For every person you release, we will kill an equal number of Chaos race experts, so those you release will be killed by us in return... This way, it won't weaken the myriad races while strengthening the Human race! This doesn't count as aiding the enemy!"

The pupils of several individuals contracted slightly.

Such bold words, and quite ruthless too.

Even Su Yu felt a slight tremor in his heart. This Great Zhou King... I never said anything like that.

But upon careful thought, Su Yu realized that without concrete proof, the other party might indeed be hesitant to hand over people recklessly.

After all, it would be aiding the enemy.

However, if they killed experts of the same level, then handing them over wouldn't result in any loss!

The Heavenly Sovereigns exchanged glances, each showing a hint of surprise.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "Since the lineage master has said so... we are not the type to haggle over every detail! How about this, you kill first, and for every quasi-king you kill, we will release one..."

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "That's impossible. If we suffer heavy losses before achieving anything, it might not be worth it! Moreover, we also need support! How about this, General Xuelan can stay behind... Rest assured, she is the daughter of the Snow King, and we will never abandon her! But we need the support of Marquis Giant Axe's strength, otherwise, how can we kill a Heavenly Sovereign?"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "I have the power of a Heavenly Sovereign, but how can one person's strength reverse the situation? If Marquis Giant Axe returns, there might be some hope, otherwise... we would rather not make this deal!"

Release Marquis Giant Axe!

The group quickly communicated through voice transmission, and soon, Moon Heavenly Sovereign smiled, "In that case, we will keep Marquis Giant Axe for now, but we can release the other four, including General Xuelan! As long as you kill two quasi-kings and two top-tier Daofuse experts, we will believe in your sincerity... Then we will release Marquis Giant Axe. As for whether you kill a Heavenly Sovereign... that will affect future cooperation, not the current situation!"

Both Su Yu and the Great Zhou King cursed inwardly!

Who the hell wants General Xuelan, we want Giant Axe!

That's a Heavenly Sovereign!

As for the descendants of the Human King... who cares about that right now!

Disdain!

Both were quite helpless, fearing that the myriad races would not easily release Marquis Giant Axe.

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Then... we can only try our best. Without the cooperation of Marquis Giant Axe, penetrating deep into Chaos Mountain and killing a large number of experts is extremely difficult!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "Not necessarily, I believe in the strength of the Torchbearer lineage! As long as the lineage master agrees, we can quickly release Xuelan and the others, and we will not go back on our word!"

The Great Zhou King pondered for a while, nodded, and sighed, "Then so be it. I understand your thoughts. Once we engage in battle with the Chaos lineage and kill a large number of experts, perhaps all their hostility will fall upon us, and you can also observe the strength of both sides."

He smiled bitterly, "Enough, enough, since that's the case, I agree! Who let Hundred Battle ruin all my previous efforts!"

The group exchanged glances and all smiled!

With this, the foundation for cooperation was established!

You go and kill some experts for us to see, otherwise, who knows if you're just putting on a show!

The cooperation began to be discussed in depth, and both sides reluctantly reached an agreement.
