Chapter 700: Preparing to Ascend to the Upper Realm

In the endless darkness, a scene unfolded unbeknownst to Su Yu.

At this moment, Su Yu had returned to the Eastern Rift Valley. When the Great Zhou King and others saw him, they were all shocked. What had happened to him?

Top-tier experts could naturally discern a thing or two. Of course, those with weaker strength couldn't see much, only feeling that Emperor Yu seemed a bit flamboyant, having turned his hair white. White hair and white eyebrows—was he trying to attract a woman? 

To be honest, it looked quite good. Perhaps soon, this trend of white hair would spread.

Su Yu, however, paid no mind to others' gazes. With a smile, he ascended the steps of the palace. Below, many powerful figures were present. Not only were the Great Zhou King and others there, but Shan Qi had also returned.

He was responsible for secretly monitoring Zhao Chuan and his group. At this moment, Shan Qi glanced at Su Yu, noting his white hair, but didn't think much of it. Instead, he felt that Su Yu appeared even more dignified.

He quickly reported, "Emperor Yu, the passage to the Upper Realm in the endless void has been located! However, we haven't rashly attempted to explore it, fearing that there might be people from Marquis Dingjun on the other side. So, we've been observing for these past days!"

Shan Qi continued, "According to our observations, this passage only appears once a month. Normally, it remains hidden in the void, undetectable and inaccessible. In other words, whether entering or exiting, it requires a month's time!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Shan Qi went on, "The passage also contains numerous dangers—astral winds, thunder, and tribulations of rules..."

Su Yu nodded again and asked softly, "Then how does it differ from the passage to the Life Realm?"

Since both are dangerous, what's the difference?

Shan Qi didn't know, but the Great Zhou King stepped forward and quickly said, "Emperor Yu, there are differences between this passage and the one to the Life Realm! The Life Realm passage is the main route, known to all the myriad races. This passage is a secretly opened minor path. The Life Realm passage can accommodate the Lords of Rules, but this passage cannot! In other words, the Lords of Rules cannot enter through this passage!"

Su Yu smiled and nodded. Indeed, this was not the ancient times. 

Now, it seemed there was no difference. But in ancient times, there were many Lords of Rules. If the Torchbearer controlled this passage and wanted to launch a surprise attack, it wouldn't work because without reaching the level of a Lord of Rules, who could you surprise?

Of course, that was ancient history. 

Today, this difference no longer mattered.

The Great Zhou King continued, "The tribulations within this passage are fewer than those in the main passage! Because the main passage was once targeted at the Lords of Rules, during its peak, even the Lords of Rules would be struck dead if they forced their way through!"

"And the passage we control is a weakened version. Currently, the power of rules in the main passage can strike down a Daofuse cultivator, but this minor path has half the punitive power, making it difficult to strike down a Daofuse cultivator!"

Su Yu nodded again. Zhao Chuan and his group were able to descend because of this. Otherwise, an Eternal trying to pass through the Life Realm would have been struck dead long ago!

The Great Zhou King continued, "Moreover, the entrance to the main passage might now be controlled by the myriad races, while this passage is under the control of Marquis Dingjun. Marquis Dingjun himself is only at the Daofuse level, and it's uncertain if he has any Daofuse subordinates. If we choose to enter through this passage, we can maintain the highest level of secrecy and even capture Marquis Dingjun!"

Su Yu nodded once more, smiling, "That's true. The Great Zhou King has considered this thoroughly."

The Great Zhou King smiled but said nothing.

After a moment of contemplation, Su Yu asked, "Can we ascend through this passage now?"

"We can!"

Shan Qi replied in a deep voice, "In my judgment, the passage is relatively stable, though there are certainly some risks. Zhao Chuan and his group suffered significant losses descending; ascending might be even more challenging!"

Su Yu lightly tapped the armrest of his chair and said, "I've observed that such passages are composed of multiple rules: the power of space, the power of time, the power of defense, the power of teleportation, the power of suppression, the power of formations... The strong who opened the main path must have been formidable, or perhaps it was opened by multiple Lords of Rules together!"

"Who opened the Torchbearer's passage?"

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King, who replied solemnly, "I don't know the specifics. It was passed down from the ancient Human Emperor, possibly opened by the Human Emperor or a powerful subordinate. The outside world doesn't know."

Su Yu glanced at him, nodded slightly, and didn't ask further. After some thought, he said, "Summon the Great Ming King, the Time King, the Silkworm Exterminator King, and Hu Xiansheng... Have them gather here!"

The Great Zhou King was moved and quickly said, "Emperor Yu intends to send people to the Upper Realm? That's fine, but there are still crises in the lower realm. Emperor Yu must not go personally. The Upper Realm has many powerful figures; it's best to explore first!"

He was worried that Su Yu would go personally! It was too dangerous, as there were still many top-tier experts in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu smiled, "Why can't I go? It's a gamble, after all. If I don't go, how will I know the specifics? Enough with the nonsense."

The Great Zhou King's expression changed slightly, and he quickly said, "Then I won't stop Emperor Yu, but I must accompany you. I know Marquis Dingjun and others, so at least I can gather some information and not be completely in the dark."

"Impossible!"

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng stood up and squinted, "The Great Zhou King should stay. Being familiar with the Upper Realm's strong might not be a good thing! It's obvious you're from the lower realm. If the Great Zhou King isn't here, we can pretend to be a scattered force! Zhao Chuan also mentioned that the human race in the Upper Realm is scattered into multiple forces. You don't know me, and I don't know you. We can even pretend to be under Marquis Minshan, since Marquis Minshan was killed!"

The Great Zhou King frowned, "Unfamiliar with the place..."

Wan Tiansheng said quietly, "It's precisely because it's unfamiliar that it's dangerous! The fear is that once in the Upper Realm, we can't provide timely support. If someone colludes with the Upper Realm, internal issues will be even more troublesome!"

The Great Zhou King's face changed, somewhat angry, "Wan Tiansheng, are you suspecting me?"

Wan Tiansheng said calmly, "Not at all! The clear are clear, and the turbid are turbid! If you haven't done anything wrong, you won't fear ghosts knocking at your door! This concern is not mine alone! Once in the Upper Realm, to put it bluntly, we're neither in heaven nor on earth. What if the Great Zhou King betrays us? Exposes Emperor Yu's whereabouts, contacts the ancient figures of the Upper Realm to kill Emperor Yu—isn't that a possibility?"

The Great Zhou King was furious, "Nonsense! I am a Torchbearer, inheriting the fire of the human race. How could I do such a thing!"

Wan Tiansheng said calmly, "What you inherited is the ancient fire, not the fire of this era! This is the New Yu Calendar, not the Yong'an Calendar. I hope the Great Zhou King doesn't get it wrong!"

"Ridiculous!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was somewhat angry. He could endure, but at this time, Wan Tiansheng was clearly questioning him. If he didn't clarify, how would others view him?

At this moment, the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, and these old friends were all present. 

It wasn't just a private conversation!

Strictly speaking, this was a court meeting. If Wan Tiansheng smeared him and he didn't refute, wouldn't that be a guilty conscience?

At this time, others were silently watching, saying nothing.

Unfortunately, Wan Tiansheng had an ally. The next moment, in the corner, an old man with a sneaky demeanor stood up and said earnestly, "Great Zhou King, let's discuss this properly, present facts, reason, and evidence. Tiansheng only mentioned a possibility, not that you are a traitor. Why are you so agitated?"

The Great Zhou King cursed inwardly and said solemnly, "Lan Tian, you're questioning me, where's the evidence?"

The old man, who was Lan Tian in disguise, chuckled, "Evidence? What evidence? Who questioned you? As I said, it's just a possibility."

"Then it's slander!"

The Great Zhou King said coldly, "I suspect you, Lan Tian, too. You infiltrated the myriad realms, maybe colluding with the myriad races!"

Lan Tian laughed, "How could that be? We must talk about evidence."

"Then you slandered me, where's the evidence?"

Lan Tian nodded, smiling, "Makes sense! It seems we can't slander people casually!"

Saying this, Lan Tian said quietly, "To prove my innocence, I'll open my sea of will. Emperor Yu can search and investigate. If there's anything unusual, kill me to settle it!"

Lan Tian looked sorrowful, "I must prove my innocence! The Great Zhou King slandered me, but I feel I didn't do it. If he insists, I can only do this!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King was exhausted. They were waiting for him!

Damn!

These people, now each one of them, even calculating the old seniors.

Are they still human?

Playing this game with me!

He was about to say something when, above, Su Yu said calmly, "Alright, everyone quiet down! In cultivation, who doesn't have some privacy? If I've cultivated to this level, why would I open my sea of will for others to see?"

With these words, the Great Zhou King breathed a sigh of relief and was about to speak when Su Yu said lightly, "Bring the Great Zhou King along, and also Lan Tian! Director Wan will stay behind! The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King don't need to go, assist Director Wan in overseeing the myriad realms! This time, focus on the Eternals, with fewer Daofuse going. Bringing Eternals is to see if there's a chance to reach Daofuse. As for Daofuse, being able to join forces to kill a Heavenly King is enough!"

Everyone inhaled sharply. The way he spoke, it was as if killing a Heavenly King was simple.

The Great Zhou King, Lan Tian, Su Yu, and the Great Ming King—according to this calculation, only four Daofuse would ascend. Could they kill a Heavenly King?

Lan Tian's voice instantly turned plaintive, "Emperor Yu, must you bring him along?"

Su Yu chuckled, "The Great Zhou King being familiar with the Upper Realm's people is a good thing. At least there's a buffer! He can also help us understand some internal matters. After all, Zhao Chuan and his group aren't considered high-level."

After speaking, Su Yu added, "As for the number of people, try to keep it under thirty. Too many is not good, or even twenty is better!"

After some thought, Su Yu added, "Also, summon the Iron Devourer Race's September, the Hou Race's Swallowing Heaven, the Space Ancient Beast Race's Kong Kong, and the Life Race's Changhe to accompany us!"

The Great Qin King stepped forward and said solemnly, "Bringing them along? Is that... appropriate?"

Su Yu smiled faintly and said, "If there's a chance, let them prove their Dao in the Upper Realm. Changhe and Tun Tian haven't done so yet, but we'll see how things go. It's mainly to prevent any unforeseen conflicts with the other races in the Upper Realm."

He continued, "At critical moments, I might need to contact these races. We'll need intermediaries to step in; otherwise, how could we just show up at their doorstep?"

The Great Qin King pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement.

"For now, let's proceed as planned. Have them come to the Eastern Rift Valley quickly. Also, make sure these races bring their tokens or the seal of their clan leaders."

"Understood!"

Everyone responded in unison, clearly aware that they couldn't stop Su Yu from going.

Seeing that no one else had anything to say, Su Yu continued, "As for the Myriad Realms, follow Director Wan's lead. Additionally, the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, and General Hongmeng will assist. Keep a close watch on the three major realms!"

"In the Death Realm, let the South King and Marquis Lanshan take charge, without interfering with each other!"

"The battles will continue. Those who need to prove their Dao should do so, and those who need to cultivate should not waste time!"

Finally, Su Yu stood up and said, "One more thing: no one is allowed to venture into the Endless Void to deal with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. Even if you see an opportunity, do not act!"

He specifically looked at Wan Tiansheng, who nodded in understanding. Su Yu was worried that in his absence, Wan Tiansheng might lead a group to ambush the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. Although Wan Tiansheng had considered it, Su Yu's concerns were valid. That individual represented the fate of the previous dynasty and was not easy to kill.

"Since everyone is clear, let's adjourn!"

With that, Su Yu turned to the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, frowning slightly, "You two have just started on the path of the Desolate Beast, which might feel awkward. But you've walked the path of the physical body for many years. This is just a different form of the same path. The essence isn't much different. Set aside your weapons for now and push yourselves to the Heavenly King Realm first! A true expert isn't necessarily limited to one type of power!"

The two kings bowed slightly. Indeed, their progress had been slow recently. By rights, they were already very strong, and having embarked on the path of the Desolate Beast, their progress shouldn't have slowed.

It was mainly because they were holding back. Knowing too much sometimes became a hindrance.

Su Yu said no more, and the crowd dispersed.

Soon, only Wan Tiansheng remained in the hall. Su Yu smiled and said, "Principal, there are a few more things I need to discuss with you."

"First, don't go to the Luminous Domain Mansion. Let the Martial Emperor sulk on his own!"

"Second, if you encounter danger, you can seek help at Starfall Mountain. Just shout, but don't stay for more than three days!"

"Third, the Five Elemental Race has two groups of strong individuals comparable to Daofuse. If you need them, contact the Topsoil Spirit to lead them out!"

"Fourth, in the Death Realm, anyone can kill Marquis Dragonblood, but our people must not."

"Fifth, the Dragon and Phoenix races are currently under watch. If they act up and you can't control them, eliminate them!"

"Sixth, Duo Bao is searching for the councilor's order. Remember to collect it regularly, lest it gets lost."

"Seventh, be cautious of the three major realms. They have deep foundations and might cause unexpected trouble..."

He gave his instructions one by one, and Wan Tiansheng nodded with a smile. Even without Su Yu's reminders, he knew what to do.

Finally, Wan Tiansheng said, "Be careful yourself. Lan Tian is unreliable. As for the Great Zhou King, I'm not too worried about him doing anything, but I'm concerned that his considerations might become a hindrance."

Su Yu nodded and smiled, "I'm aware of these issues. It's not a big problem."

Wan Tiansheng said no more. Su Yu had grown rapidly and no longer needed constant guidance.

However, it was his first time heading to the Upper Realm.

Su Yu reassured him, "Don't worry. In the coming days, I'll review the memories of Marquis Meteor Star and others to gain a general understanding of the Upper Realm. I won't go up unprepared."

He wasn't entirely without confidence. For instance, he could access the memories of Marquis Meteor Star and others. Even if incomplete, they provided some insight into the various races.

Combined with intelligence from Zhao Chuan and information from the Great Zhou King, Su Yu could piece together the situation in the Upper Realm.

Hearing this, Wan Tiansheng felt somewhat reassured.

Finally, Su Yu smiled again, "As always, when venturing out, there's a risk of death. If I die, Principal, don't linger. Take everyone and leave, including my teachers. Whether you go to the Endless Void or elsewhere, or even transform into half-dead spirits and head to the Death Realm, just don't fight. You can't win!"

"I understand."

Su Yu laughed, "That's good. With you around, I'm at ease. I'll be back in one to three months."

"Alright!"

...

After their conversation, Su Yu saw no one else.

He waited for other powerful figures to gather.

Meanwhile, Su Yu was in seclusion, absorbing and digesting some memories. Last time, he had slain Marquis Meteor Star, Marquis Demon Sway, and Marquis Abyss. These were ancient powerhouses who had always been in the Upper Realm.

Marquis Heavenly Dragon was still alive, and perhaps he could provide some intelligence.

With Zhao Chuan and others, Su Yu, in seclusion, gradually pieced together some understanding of the Upper Realm.

The entire Upper Realm had no suppressive force!

Or rather, the entire Upper Realm was a land without rules. It wasn't that there were no rules, but there weren't the same constraints as the lower realms. There were no tribulations upon proving the Dao. In the Upper Realm, one didn't have to follow the Three Body Method.

The Upper Realm was vast, not smaller than the Myriad Realms.

There, top experts had established their own dojos.

In the Upper Realm, dojos were the main focus.

A Daofuse expert was often the master of a dojo.

There were many battles in the Upper Realm, primarily to seize unowned rules. According to the memories of Marquis Meteor Star and others, these unowned rules differed from the great paths of the lower realms.

First, they definitely had no owner.

Second, most were incomplete, possibly remnants left after the fall of a rule master, and could even be devoured to strengthen one's own Dao power.

Third, there was a River of Time in the Upper Realm, but it seemed different from the lower realms.

They hadn't opened the Heaven Gate, so they weren't sure of the specifics, but they could sense the difference.

Thus, in the Upper Realm, seizing rules was the top priority, followed by exterminating the Human Race, and thirdly, eliminating some natives.

Yes, natives!

There were natives in the Upper Realm, akin to the Desolate Beasts.

They were born after the creation of heaven and earth!

The Myriad Realms also had them in the past, or there wouldn't have been the scene of the Culture King slaying Desolate Beasts. However, during the Human Emperor's era, these beings were nearly exterminated. The Upper Realm was developed later than the Myriad Realms, initially for the Human Race alone. The Human Race had been exterminating them but hadn't wiped them out completely.

These creatures left after the creation of heaven and earth were all powerful. Some might not have cultivated any Dao power, but their physical bodies were naturally strong, making them hard to kill. They were also bloodthirsty and often attacked dojos.

Additionally, there might be some ancient beings in the Upper Realm who rarely showed themselves. They might have captured some rules long ago and were in seclusion, absorbing and digesting them. This was normal.

So, the Ninth Tide might not have seen all the strong ones appear, which reminded Su Yu that the current intelligence might not be entirely accurate.

Su Yu also wanted to know about some traitors, but unfortunately, Marquis Meteor Star and others seemed to have no memory of this.

After careful consideration, Su Yu decided to meet the West King's Consort.

He had captured her almost half a year ago, but they hadn't formally talked.

This trip to the Upper Realm also had the purpose of finding the Control King's faction.

...

The West King's Consort was feeling restless lately.

Although time meant little to her, it had been a long time, about half a year?

Captured for so long, Su Yu hadn't made any moves or spoken a word to her, making her uneasy, even slightly explosive. She was tempted to just fight it out!

Confined in this small space, her physical body destroyed, her Dao sealed, only her sea of will was clear, making healing difficult. She was very frustrated.

Just as she was brooding, her eyes flickered.

In this small space, she had managed to restore a physical body, though it was extremely weak.

At that moment, a figure appeared.

Seeing Su Yu, the West King's Consort was momentarily dazed. Was this... Su Yu?

Why was his hair white?

It seemed like his lifespan was exhausted, but... that couldn't be!

She suppressed her urge to ask, coldly glancing at Su Yu without speaking.

Su Yu, however, smiled, waved his hand to create a long table, then conjured a chair, and said with a smile, "West King's Consort, it's been a while. How have you been in this place?"

The West King's Consort coldly stared at him, saying nothing.

Su Yu smiled again, "Why so cold? Don't look or guess. I just lost a battle. Tiangu has some skills, forcing me to burn my lifespan to escape. Luckily, I survived. I probably have a hundred years left, which isn't too bad!"

The West King's Consort was shocked.

A hundred years!

A rising prodigy, with only a hundred years to live?

A hundred years would pass in the blink of an eye!

Su Yu had lost!

While she thought this, a mocking smile appeared on her face, "You might not even live a hundred years. You've already lost in the lower realm. Once the Upper Realm opens, how long can you survive?"

As for Su Yu lying, she hadn't considered it.

Why? There was no need.

Su Yu indeed had little lifespan left.

Unless he had lost to the myriad races' experts and had to flee for his life, why would he burn his lifespan for fun?

Ridiculous!

So defeat was the only outcome.

Su Yu laughed, "Living day by day is still quite carefree! Even if I die, I'll take a few more of those guys from the lower realm with me! Fortunately, I didn't come away empty-handed. Although Tiangu didn't die, I did kill Marquis Meteor Star and Marquis Demon Sway!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Surprised?"

The West King's Consort frowned slightly, "They descended to the lower realm?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Those two fools thought they could ambush me! If it weren't for the chance to kill them, I wouldn't have paid such a high price!"

As he spoke, he sneered, "I did suffer a bit, but killing them was worth it!"

The West King's Consort mocked, "You are the Human Lord. Is trading your life for two ancient marquises really worth it? Laughable! There are more ancient marquises in the Upper Realm than you can count on both hands!"

Su Yu laughed, "Is that so? Well, it's enough for me. I also took down the West King and the East King... Overall, it's not a loss, is it?"

The West King's Consort remained silent, her face cold. In her mind, she pondered why Su Yu had come to see her this time. Was he drawn to her? Or was there another reason?

Though she speculated, she didn't dare take it seriously. She scoffed and sat lazily beside Su Yu on a long bench, her black robe parting to reveal her fair thigh. It was not a proper sitting posture; rather, it was one of disdain. "Defeated is defeated. Did you come to me hoping for some comfort?"

Su Yu smiled lightly, "Not at all. I'm not that despondent. It's just one defeat, not something I can't afford."

He continued, "You see, having just been defeated, the Great Zhou King somehow brought in a few powerful human experts from the Upper Realm, claiming they are under the command of Marquis Dingjun."

The West King's Consort's heart trembled slightly. The Upper Realm, Marquis Dingjun!

Su Yu chuckled, "It's just one defeat, nothing more. However, the Great Zhou King seems to believe that the Upper Realm has found a way to unseal the Hundred Battle King and wants me to assist them!"

"Hundred Battle..." The West King's Consort frowned slightly. Her interest in seducing Su Yu diminished. She was eager to hear more.

Su Yu smiled, "I came to you because I'm pondering something... You are of the Control King's bloodline. You should know, or perhaps you were involved. I want to ask, was the Hundred Battle King betrayed back then, or did he betray us?"

Su Yu frowned, "The Great Zhou King wants me to help him and the Upper Realm to unseal the Hundred Battle King together! According to them, only the Hundred Battle King can save the human race... Ha!"

He laughed disdainfully, "I only trust myself! But, after this defeat, I need to give everyone an explanation. The Great Zhou King has controlled the human race for many years. Now, with the arrival of people from the Upper Realm and my defeat, some are wavering. Many are advising me to join forces with the Upper Realm to rescue the Hundred Battle King!"

The West King's Consort silently gathered all the information, her mind racing. Outwardly, she feigned indifference, smirking, "Do you think I'll tell you anything? Dream on!"

Su Yu smiled, "Just asking, not expecting much! You and I are actually in the same boat! If I don't end well, do you think you will?"

With a hint of disdain, Su Yu continued, "What is the Hundred Battle King? He ruined a great situation, and now he wants to come back and take my place? Seeing me defeated, with my lifespan exhausted, do they think I have no hope? I reached the Daofuse Realm in twenty years and have a hundred years left to live. Are they so sure I can't become a master of the power of laws?"

"As long as I succeed, I can naturally restore my lifespan!"

The West King's Consort finally understood. Su Yu's defeat had cost him much of his lifespan. Betting on Su Yu meant betting on this one success, or there would be no next chance!

The Great Zhou King and others might not dare to bet on his guaranteed victory! In reality, they couldn't see any hope of winning. Even if the Hundred Battle King failed, there might still be another chance, as long as he didn't die. But for Su Yu... becoming a master of the power of laws in a hundred years? No one had achieved that in this world for a long time!

No wonder he was being abandoned!

At this moment, the West King's Consort felt a bit of pity for Su Yu, mixed with some mocking sympathy, "It seems you've been abandoned by the human race! After all, a Human Lord who can only live for a hundred years... might not even live for ten. Even if they don't kill you, you'll surely die in a hundred years. Why would anyone follow you to death?"

Su Yu coldly stared at her, "I'm a dying man, and what about you? Don't forget, you're still in my hands! If I die, you won't have a good end either!"

He snorted, speaking in a low voice, "I need some evidence to make the Great Zhou King and others unable to stand their ground! You are from the Control King's lineage. I don't care if it's true or false, you need to fabricate evidence that the Hundred Battle King has already betrayed the human race!"

The West King's Consort was shocked. Whether true or false?

Su Yu said quietly, "Do you understand? Whether true or false! I just need evidence! Irrefutable evidence! The Hundred Battle King wants to come out, did he ask me? He ruined the ancient foundation, and I've built this land bit by bit. Does he want to pick the fruits? Even if I can't live forever, this century is my era, Su Yu's era!"

"The human race doesn't entirely support the Great Zhou King. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King are my people. They have their influence, but I need evidence! You... must provide it!"

The West King's Consort frowned, speaking calmly, "I'm your prisoner. Even if I say the Hundred Battle King betrayed us, no one will believe me. They'll just think you forced me to frame him!"

"I know!" Su Yu replied coldly, "Do you think I'm an idiot? Would I have you stand up and accuse the Hundred Battle King? Do you really think I'm that stupid? I don't need you; I need the people behind you to help me create some evidence! Or, reveal the real evidence. I don't care if it's true or false; the Hundred Battle King... is a traitor!"

The West King's Consort looked at him and laughed, "Are you begging me?"

"Begging you?" Su Yu suddenly reached out, grabbing her by the neck, his voice icy, "I'm not begging you; I'm ordering you! If the Hundred Battle King returns, I'll kill you first! I'm not killing you now because you're still useful. If you don't cooperate, what use are you? Do you want to die?"

Crack!

His grip tightened, causing her neck to fracture, blood seeping out, a scene both tragic and beautiful.

Yet, the West King's Consort still smiled, "Are you begging me?"

"You're courting death!" Su Yu's voice was merciless, "Don't force me to kill you now! Your little tricks won't work on me, Su Yu. I want value, utility, not seduction. It's laughable that you think you can conquer me! Or do you think I'm as foolish as the West King? You, a woman who can be with anyone, think you can conquer me, Su Yu?"

The West King's Consort's expression gradually darkened.

Su Yu coldly demanded, "Speak!"

Boom!

He flung her aside, her body crashing into the surrounding barriers, shattering, blood flowing as she lay coughing up blood, yet still laughing, "Su Yu, don't you hate traitors the most? You want me to fabricate evidence to slander the Hundred Battle King. How are you any different from us?"

Su Yu regained his composure, "You're wrong! I'm not betraying anyone; I'm setting things right! The Hundred Battle King is a fool, and I'm not! I failed once, just bad luck, and no human experts died! I even killed two ancient marquises. I don't think I was wrong! The Hundred Battle King, however, destroyed the foundation of the human race; he's the criminal!"

"I, Su Yu, can step down, but it will never be for the Hundred Battle King!"

Su Yu spoke calmly, "I'll ask you one last time, is there a way? If not... your existence seems unnecessary. Do you really think I'd be interested in you?"

The West King's Consort's heart hardened, glaring coldly at Su Yu. This guy's words were truly hateful!

After a long pause, the West King's Consort slowly stood up, smirking, "Even if I could help you, you wouldn't be able to fabricate evidence. Even if there is evidence, it would only be in the Upper Realm. Do you think the experts there will believe you're stronger than the Hundred Battle King?"

Su Yu replied coldly, "That's none of your concern! As long as there's evidence, the Upper Realm will waver! If the Hundred Battle King isn't a traitor, the message... will naturally reach the Upper Realm and return to the Lower Realm because the myriad races... want us to fight internally! Don't take me for a fool, and don't take the myriad races for fools!"

"They would love for me and the Hundred Battle King to fight!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Once the message is out, soon, it will spread in the Lower Realm, coming from the Upper Realm! In this way, what right does the Great Zhou King have to ask me to help them unseal the Hundred Battle King? The Great Zhou King and others firmly believe the Hundred Battle King won't betray us. I don't believe it, the humans of this tide don't believe it, my allies don't believe it... that's enough! Is there even a choice between following me or a potential traitor?"

Su Yu said softly, "As for how to get the information you provide to the Upper Realm, it's simple... just let the Immortal, Demon, and God races do it. They'd be happy to, without needing me to step in, right?"

"Indeed!" The West King's Consort laughed, "Su Yu, though young, you're ruthless and cunning! The Hundred Battle King may not be a traitor, but with your actions, he will be."

"That's not my concern!"

The West King's Consort laughed, "Since you put it that way, I naturally have to cooperate with you. After all, you and I are one now."

She smiled seductively, but Su Yu felt a chill. Damn it, this was too similar to Blue Sky's smile, disgusting!

As she laughed, the West King's Consort quickly said, "Don't expect to use these methods to find the Control King's lineage. It's impossible, but I can give you something. In my storage ring, there's a black ink jade. If you can find a way to take it to the Upper Realm and meet someone, tell them your request, and they will naturally fulfill it!"

She continued, smiling faintly, "I'm just afraid you won't be able to take it up. If you do... don't expect much. The person you'll meet is just an ordinary Upper Realm expert, knowing nothing. But the message will quickly reach our people, and your goal will naturally be achieved!"

Su Yu frowned, then quickly said, "Are you sure it can reach your lineage?"

"Naturally."

The West King's Consort chuckled and said, "You should save your strength. It's impossible for you to find anyone from our lineage. Even if you try to use intermediaries, you won't succeed. Our lineage is far more powerful and complex than you imagine! Su Yu, if you truly find yourself at a dead end, consider seeking refuge with me. I can grant you a new life..."

"Get lost!"

With a swift palm strike, Su Yu sent her flying, sneering coldly, "You think you're worthy?"

A disdainful laugh echoed as Su Yu vanished from sight. The West King's Consort stood up silently, a faint smile on her lips as she watched the direction in which Su Yu had disappeared, her heart filled with cold amusement.

Not worthy? You, who are on the brink of death, still dare to be so arrogant! Whether you intend to harm the Hundred Battle King or seek out someone from my lineage, you're destined to end up with nothing!

All those promises of granting you a wish or helping you achieve your goals are nothing but nonsense.

Secretly, the West King's Consort hoped that Su Yu would deliver the item to that person. Once delivered, certain matters would naturally come to the attention of the powerful figures in her lineage. Perhaps, she would soon receive reinforcements!

She had realized that tempting Su Yu was exceedingly difficult, but this guy shouldn't think he would have an easy time either!

...

At this moment, Su Yu was laughing.

Quite satisfied!

Not bad. At the very least, he had learned something: the West King's Consort indeed had means to contact people from the Upper Realm.

That was enough!

As for the black jade, he would examine it thoroughly later. If necessary, he would seal it to prevent any oversight. Once he reached the Upper Realm, he didn't want to be instantly discovered.

It was a good reminder.

Otherwise, there might have been trouble.

"I need to check everything on me later to avoid being set up. If necessary, I'll toss everything into the River of Time for a wash. No matter how strong the power of laws is, it will be washed away!"

It was nothing more than some concealed power of laws. Others might not be able to deal with it or even detect it, but could the River of Time fail to notice?

Playing this game with him, Su Yu wasn't foolish enough to carry the black jade to meet the contact.

Looking up at the sky, Su Yu smiled. It was time to prepare for a trip up there.
