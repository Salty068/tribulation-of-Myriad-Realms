Chapter 691: The Emergence of the Child of Destiny

Su Yu had pinpointed the locations of the Four Great Domains and was now waiting for his subordinates to gather. Meanwhile, he began to tally the Councilor Tokens. The Immortal Battle Marquis had given him six, and from his battles against various powerful beings, including the Golden-winged Roc, the Spirit Race, and the Abyssal Race, he had acquired several more. After the recent battle, all the Councilor Tokens were handed over to Su Yu, totaling nine.

With this, Su Yu now possessed a total of fifteen Councilor Tokens. The Iron Devourer Race and its allied races kept their own tokens, but if he were to request them, he could probably gather another five or six. Xia Longwu and the others were currently campaigning against the myriad races. Some ancient races might not have Daofuse cultivators, but they likely still possessed Councilor Tokens. 

He wondered if he could acquire some more. If he managed to annihilate the Four Great Domains, he could gain at least four more tokens. Some ancient races had more than one token, as many of the 99 ancient races had been destroyed, leaving their tokens scattered. Some were seized by the three great races, while others were dispersed across the myriad realms.

"If I gather them all, I might end up with around thirty tokens," Su Yu mused. There were certainly more than this number of tokens in the lower realm, likely exceeding fifty. Back when Empyrean Cloud broke the rules and Old Turtle forced the myriad races to use their tokens to dispel the punitive force, over forty tokens emerged. The Immortal Battle Marquis had handed over six, so the lower realm surely had more than fifty tokens.

While waiting, Su Yu finished counting the tokens and began to observe the Death Spirit Dao. He realized he could actually walk the Death Spirit Dao! This was a surprising discovery for Su Yu, as he was a half-death spirit. He found that he might be able to step into the Death Spirit Dao and explore it. He vaguely sensed a connection and affinity with the Death Spirit Dao.

Perhaps he was the first Human Lord in countless ages to achieve this. Being the only Human Lord to transform into a half-death spirit, Su Yu discovered that this transformation brought many benefits and few drawbacks.

"Life and death, yin and yang..." Su Yu pondered. Perhaps the Dao was indeed divided into life and death. The idea of the Death Spirit Realm's pathfinder wasn't wrong. If one could open a realm for living beings, one could open a realm for death spirits. But why was it not perfected? Was it due to insufficient strength? Why couldn't the Death Spirit Dao branch out, and why could it only follow one path?

These thoughts swirled in Su Yu's mind. "Does the Death Spirit Dao have an end?" "It should," he concluded. After all, it wasn't as vast as the River of Time, nor as powerful.

Su Yu was eager to enter the Death Spirit Dao to see for himself, and perhaps also to see how the only branch, the Ink Dao, was grafted by the Culture King. Although Su Yu was progressing rapidly, he still felt that his strength was improving too slowly.

He considered himself at the fourth tier of Daofuse. He had divided Daofuse into six or seven tiers, and the fourth tier wasn't weak, comparable to some veteran Daofuse cultivators. Yet, Su Yu was not satisfied. Such strength was insufficient to lead the myriad races, to wage war across the heavens, or to match the Martial Emperor and others.

In the Upper Realm, there were many third-tier Daofuse cultivators, and even first and second-tier ones, not to mention those at the quasi-king level. Quantity wasn't the only factor. If the quality was high, even ten Heavenly King-level opponents might be too much for Su Yu's side to handle.

He looked towards the Death Spirit Dao. At this moment, the Heaven Gate opened, revealing a massive Dao spanning the Death Spirit Realm, akin to the River of Time, but without any branches, with all power unified. All power was drawn from the Death Spirit Dao.

As these thoughts occupied his mind, Su Yu wondered how many powerful beings were sealed away. Soon, Su Yu spoke, "Senior South King, please watch over things here for me. I'm going to explore the Dao. If the Great Zhou King and others arrive, have them wait."

The South King frowned, "Which Dao are you going to explore?"

"The Death Spirit Dao!"

"That's too dangerous!" the South King said gravely. "The Death Spirit Dao is different from other Daos. The River of Time is actually less dangerous because it's more inclusive. The Death Spirit Dao is more repulsive! You're not a death spirit, so it's too easy for something to go wrong!"

Su Yu chuckled, "I'm afraid of something going wrong too, but... how can one advance in cultivation if they're always cautious and hesitant?"

Su Yu's laughter was hearty, "Cultivation is about exploring the unknown! Every pathfinder has faced these challenges. If one fails midway, it's due to fate or lack of strength, and there's nothing to be done."

Su Yu looked at everyone, "If I only seek stability, I'll surely lose when the Upper Realm opens!"

Despite Su Yu's confident demeanor, he was well aware of the risks. He sighed, "How many Heavenly Kings can we muster? Can anyone match the power of a ruler? The pen dao isn't truly my path. Even with exceptional talent, can I truly master the pen dao in five years? Besides, I might not even have five years!"

Su Yu spoke softly, "The myriad races aren't foolish, nor are the Immortals, Demons, and Gods. I said five years, but they might judge that I'll attack within three years! If they think three years, then I can't let them predict my actions. One year!"

Su Yu's eyes were resolute, "I must be able to resist the myriad races within a year! The New Yu Calendar is about to begin, and I hope to end the battles in the lower realm before the year ends, achieving the unification of the myriad realms!"

Everyone was shocked. One year! Wasn't that too short?

Su Yu had already stepped into the Daofuse Realm, embarking on the pen dao, but was it really that simple to master Daofuse? Mastering the pen dao was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!

At this moment, Marquis Lanshan spoke with admiration, "Your Majesty will surely accomplish this great feat! Back then, the Human Emperor took a thousand years to unify the heavens. Now, Your Majesty will sweep across the heavens once more, and surely faster than the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu laughed, "It's different. Back then, each race had rulers. Achieving unification in a thousand years was already impressive."

"Your Majesty will only be stronger!" Marquis Lanshan asserted again, for Su Yu was indeed exceptionally talented and still very young. Moreover, the myriad races today weren't the same as they were back then. Of course, the Human Race wasn't the same either, but this was also an opportunity.

Su Yu chuckled, "Thank you for your confidence. Let's not dwell on this. I'll take a look at the Death Spirit Dao now. Everyone... though I don't want to sound pessimistic, if something does happen to me, I hope you all can unite to resist the myriad races. To avoid massive losses, they probably won't attack recklessly! If they scatter, they'll surely die!"

"Your Majesty..."

Su Yu raised his hand, "Just some words of caution. I'm confident nothing will happen! But just in case, it's better to leave some words behind."

Su Yu smiled, "I originally planned to deal with the four races first, but I worry my strength isn't enough and might hold us back! Just as I had some insights, I want to take a look. Everyone, that's all. Wait for me a while, and I'll return!"

With that, the Heaven Gate opened, and Su Yu stepped into the void.

Below, the South King suddenly said, "The Culture King once stepped into this path and said... said that although this path is strong, it ultimately doesn't deviate from the essence of the Dao!"

Su Yu paused, thoughtful, and turned back, "Any other words?"

The South King pondered for a long time before saying, "That's about it. After all, he was the Culture King. He came to the Death Spirit Realm back then because I was a Heavenly King, and he visited my residence a few times, so we had some exchanges."

Su Yu nodded and said no more.

Tearing through the void, he stepped into the Death Spirit Dao.

Below, the South King sighed softly, "Most of the Human Lords are like this. Though my strength surpasses his, my pursuit of the Dao is far inferior!"

The pursuit of the Dao!

Relentless exploration!

Su Yu's desire to pursue the Dao was much stronger than hers. He wouldn't settle for the status quo. Any discovery would drive him forward.

For the South King, this was extremely rare and precious.

In her countless years, she had seen many living beings die, but few had the determination of Su Yu.

Marquis Lanshan looked up at the sky and said after a long while, "That's why they are commanders, and we are generals! His Majesty will surely restore the glory of ancient times, perhaps even surpass it!"

Surpass... no one dared to imagine that.

It was too difficult!

The glory of ancient times, with over a hundred rulers, was unmatched by today's standards.

...

At the same time.

Su Yu stepped into the Death Spirit Dao. The great river roared, and he seemed to see the Celestial River of Death, or perhaps the essence of the Death Spirit River, or even the River of Time of the Death Spirit Realm!

A single, straight Death Spirit Dao pierced through the heavens and earth.

There were no branches on either side.

The rules of death energy surged on both sides, waves crashing.

The one who opened this path back then was terrifyingly powerful.

As Su Yu stepped in, he felt death energy enveloping him, invading his body and sea of will rapidly.

The overwhelming death energy instantly suppressed the vitality within Su Yu.

It seemed to want to completely transform him into a death spirit!

"Stabilize my Dao!"

With a low shout, the Heaven Gate opened. Su Yu wielded his pen, writing characters that formed barriers on the Heaven Gate, blocking the invasion of death energy.

Stabilize my heart!

At the same time, the Mark of Civilization appeared. In an instant, the other pages vanished, leaving only one—the Death Spirit Page!

This page was also at the Heavenly Soldier level.

Su Yu had absorbed many death spirits, and now, this page contained some characters and some blank spaces. Vaguely, a small Death Spirit Dao was being nurtured within.

But it was very weak!

At this moment, Su Yu wielded his pen, writing some death spirit techniques, essentially the method of reversing the acupoints, to perfect this page.

Gradually, more characters appeared on the Death Spirit Page.

After finishing the method of reversing the acupoints, Su Yu quickly began to copy some things, replicating the Death Spirit Dao. He wanted to replicate this Dao.

Simultaneously, a divine character emerged.

"Death"!

The divine character appeared, albeit weakly. A large amount of the power of laws was being drawn by the pen dao, leaving Su Yu's divine character intact but extremely feeble. At this moment, Su Yu gritted his teeth and integrated the "Death" character into the page of the dead spirits.

Just as he had previously integrated "Civilization" into the Mark of Civilization, Su Yu now directly merged the "Death" character into it. Not only that, but he also crushed strands of the Martial Emperor's hair and integrated them into the page.

The page, which had nearly been shattered by the impact of the Celestial River of Death, suddenly erupted with a brilliant black light, rapidly strengthening!

A shadow emerged on the page—a phantom of a powerful dead spirit, the essence blood Su Yu had previously integrated. However, Su Yu suddenly snorted, shattering the phantom with a punch. In the next moment, a drop of his own essence blood dripped onto the page, and a new shadow appeared, somewhat resembling Su Yu himself.

"Merge the dao, open the dao, open my own dao, merge my own dao. No matter how strong others' paths are, they are still others'!"

In recent days, Su Yu had gained many insights. He no longer relied on others' essence blood but used his own, making it the core of the phantom's manifestation. A single drop of essence blood consumed a lot of energy. Excessive loss of essence blood could harm one's foundation, but it could be replenished as long as one was alive.

Back in the day, when Hong Tan and others sold essence blood, several great demons survived for decades without perishing.

After a series of operations, the black page emitted a powerful radiance, with golden patterns continuously emerging. It transformed from a low-grade heavenly weapon to a mid-grade one in the blink of an eye, and the phantom gradually advanced from the peak of the Sunmoon Realm, vaguely reaching the level of a quasi-invincible.

At this moment, Su Yu had not yet achieved the level where a single drop of essence blood could transform into an Eternal.

"Absorb!"

Su Yu tossed the page, which immediately began to frantically absorb the invading death aura. The illusory path within the page gradually strengthened.

Su Yu chuckled. This page, once thrown out, could be picked up by anyone and used like the Book of Time. By integrating a drop of dead spirit essence blood, one could begin to comprehend the cultivation methods of the dead spirit race, even borrowing the path of the dead spirits. Of course, the path of the dead spirits was quite illusory and not very powerful.

After all, it was merely constructed from the death aura and dead spirit essence blood that Su Yu himself had absorbed. It might not be as formidable as the Book of Time. However, in the future, the Mark of Civilization might surpass the Book of Time in strength.

Having completed these tasks, Su Yu felt much more at ease. The previous sensation of death aura continuously surging in, threatening to transform him into a dead spirit, was gone.

Su Yu continued along the great path, with the rushing waters of the Celestial River of Death crashing around him. Wave after wave surged forward.

Yet, Su Yu closed his Heaven Gate, silently contemplating as he moved against the current. Gradually, he gained some insights. He looked down at the rushing river and murmured, "So that's how it is!"

When he opened his Heaven Gate again, the view beneath his feet changed!

The river water beneath him transformed into countless human-like figures floating in the river. Su Yu murmured, "So, the path of the dead spirits is not about opening tributaries but merging into the mainstream! In this way, the path of the dead spirits will gradually grow stronger, but it also deprives these dead spirits of the opportunity to open their own paths!"

Su Yu shook his head, unsure whether this was good or bad. However, the master of this path of the dead spirits, when opening the path, either made a mistake or did so intentionally, resulting in the Death Realm being unable to produce a true master of the rules. They could only continuously merge paths, truly merging into a single great path!

"Is this to strengthen oneself?"

Su Yu pondered. In this way, there was also an advantage—the master of the path of the dead spirits would have sufficient control over the entire Death Realm.

"Do I also need to merge with the path of the dead spirits?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and shook his head. No, if he did that, it would be difficult to separate later!

Because once you merge into the main path, it's not something you can easily detach from. The Culture King could separate from the pen dao, but if he walked the path of the dead spirits, it would be difficult to withdraw.

"Revival, resurrection, probably all require stripping these dead spirits' paths away!"

"Can I find Xingyue's path?"

In this river, all the water might represent a dead spirit, which was terrifying!

Could he find Xingyue's path? If he found it, perhaps he could study how to strip her great path away. Although Su Yu only mastered one of the four paths of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone, some things could be substituted.

For example, the physical path of the Desolate Beast was a matter of vitality, and the path of life should be more effective.

The path of paper might have the effect of concealing heavenly secrets, and similar paths should work.

The path of ink, however, might play a significant role, suppressing the path of the dead spirits, providing an opportunity to strip it away.

With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu wasn't in a hurry to find Xingyue's path. He let out a low shout, and dense death aura emerged from his hands as he grabbed at the river below. Among the water, a single drop was caught in his hand, struggling violently!

It corroded Su Yu!

Su Yu's hands were incredibly strong, yet at this moment, they were also being corroded and cracked.

Su Yu ignored this, holding onto the drop of water as his willpower invaded, sensing it. In the next moment, he let out a muffled groan, blood flowing from his seven orifices, but his eyes flickered. This was the path of a dead spirit monarch!

It should still be alive!

However, Su Yu didn't recognize it. Although the dead spirit monarchs under his command looked similar, Su Yu could still recognize them.

"Not one of mine..."

With that, Su Yu suddenly unleashed the "Life" divine character, flooding the drop of river water with a massive amount of life force.

"Ah!"

A shrill scream suddenly erupted in the Death Realm!

At this moment, Su Yu could vaguely hear and see a burst of death aura erupting from the drop of river water. The life force and death aura clashed, quickly merging—not merging, but dissolving and canceling each other out!

The entire path of the dead spirits seemed to reject Su Yu, with massive amounts of river water crashing against him.

Boom!

Su Yu continuously retreated, blood dripping from his body.

With a bang, the drop of river water in his hand suddenly exploded!

The life force and death aura completely canceled each other out.

The result was that this path shattered!

No need to look; Su Yu knew the outcome. In the Death Realm, nine times out of ten, a dead spirit monarch had perished!

"It's a good way to kill, but unfortunately, not very practical!"

Su Yu spat blood. It wasn't practical. With his strength, he could kill a dead spirit monarch without getting injured.

But here, by unleashing life force, he dissolved the opponent's path, causing the opponent to perish. However, Su Yu was also rejected by the entire great path, resulting in significant injuries. This was just a monarch-level opponent; if it were a dead spirit marquis, Su Yu might suffer severe backlash or even fall.

"Not worth it!"

Su Yu shook his head, feeling a bit disappointed. Forcibly resurrecting someone was a dead end!

Initially, he thought that if his life force could overpower the death aura, he might be able to resurrect Xingyue. Now he realized it was impossible. If he really did that, Xingyue would undoubtedly die!

"Indeed, if it were simple, the Culture King would have resurrected her long ago!"

"An interesting path of the dead spirits..."

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly discovered something. The drop of water that had just exploded transformed into death aura, and this death aura power flowed upstream, as if being forcibly absorbed by someone.

Su Yu raised an eyebrow and continued moving upstream.

Meanwhile, his page of the dead spirits was also absorbing some of the shattered death aura. This was the rule of death aura, and Su Yu was also perfecting his page of the dead spirits.

...

Outside the great path.

The South King and others looked toward the Celestial River of Death. Just now, a monarch seemed to have fallen, inexplicably perishing.

The South King glanced around, frowning slightly, looking up. Was it Su Yu's doing?

If so, Su Yu might have discovered something.

Killing from a distance!

That was terrifying!

...

At the same time.

In the sealed land.

The black pillars of light didn't think much of it, only knowing that another monarch who had merged with the path seemed to have died. Even a mosquito's leg was meat; although it wasn't a dead spirit marquis, absorbing a bit of the power of laws was still beneficial.

The strong one named Dizhi Luo spoke again, chuckling softly, "It seems the humans are still killing? Keep killing! The more you kill, the faster we will be unsealed. One day, the great power will return as one!"

At this moment, someone in another pillar of light spoke softly, "Great power returning as one? Dizhi Luo, do you want to die? Under the great power returning as one, you and I will likely die!"

"Then let us die. Fulfill the Emperor. If the Emperor can become the sole master of the great path, even if the ancient Human Emperor and others reappear, they won't be able to match the Emperor!"

Behind, the largest pillar of light remained silent.

Great power returning as one!

This was a hypothesis, a conjecture. Back then, the humans thought about it, sealing them instead of killing them, fearing that if all these strong ones were killed, a being capable of mastering the path of the dead spirits might emerge.

At that time, the humans even considered nurturing their own dead spirit powerhouse to become the strongest existence. Unfortunately, not every dead spirit could continuously absorb the power of the dead spirits.

Marquis Lanshan was a representative. Though not weak, already a marquis, after devouring countless dead spirits, he still hadn't reached the level of a Heavenly King.

Thus, during that period, they sealed these beings rather than killing them.

...

Within the path of the dead spirits.

Su Yu walked, stopping and recovering his source qi, consuming a great deal.

As he continued forward, Su Yu gained some understanding of the path of the dead spirits, deepening his insights.

And as he walked, Su Yu seemed to discover something remarkable.

Ahead, a fork in the path appeared.

A small tributary presented itself before him!

"The path of ink!"

Su Yu was incredibly surprised. The path of ink was here!

It was quite deep. He quickly advanced, opening his Heaven Gate to look at the small tributary. A pitch-black path seemed to have been artificially carved out, and it was the only tributary Su Yu had seen!

At this moment, the tributary was also secretly absorbing some of the power of the dead spirits.

And within the path of the dead spirits, Su Yu saw something. Around this tributary, countless seals appeared, resembling the handiwork of the Culture King!

Su Yu carefully assessed it. On one hand, it concealed traces, preventing the great path from sensing it. On the other hand, it also stabilized this tributary.

Su Yu discovered that this tributary seemed to have forcibly punched a hole through the wall, and the surrounding walls of the Death Realm's path were automatically healing, trying to close this hole, but were intercepted by a certain force.

"Is this a method left behind by the Culture King?" Su Yu inhaled deeply. "The more I learn, the more I realize how truly powerful the Culture King was!"

He could see it now. Back then, the Culture King had also explored the Death Realm's path and eventually chose to forcibly open a small path here. The tributaries of the River of Time would not heal, but the Death Realm's path had a self-healing function. Under such circumstances, opening a path was almost impossible! Yet the Culture King had managed to do it. He had opened this path, and it was even siphoning power from the Death Realm's path.

"Is this the Ink Path?" Su Yu looked at the tributary and moved closer. The river water continuously surged against this tributary, trying to break through the sealing power and allow the path to heal itself. This Ink Path was like a parasite, leeching off the main path.

Su Yu observed carefully, his Heaven Gate opened to the extreme. He seemed to vaguely see a figure left behind in this tributary. "Liu Hong?" Su Yu's heart stirred, and he quickly smiled. The next moment, he reached out and grabbed some of the river water without any figures in it, extracting it into his hand. Su Yu shouted softly, and death energy erupted, quickly transforming the river water into large characters.

Then, he let out a low roar and threw the characters formed from the death energy river water into the tributary. Just as the Culture King's barrier was about to appear, Su Yu tapped it with a stroke, causing a delay with the same source of power. In the next moment, the characters formed from the river water were absorbed into the tributary.

...

At that moment, on the edge of the Celestial River of Death, Liu Hong, who was stealthily trying to hunt a death spirit monarch, suddenly felt a blur before his eyes, a moment of disorientation. The next moment, a sentence seemed to appear in his mind: "Liu Hong, call Su Yu your grandfather, or heavenly punishment will descend!"

"Cough, cough, cough!" Liu Hong instantly started coughing violently, his eyes widening in horror. What the hell? He prided himself on being calm, but now he was utterly bewildered! What was this? How did he suddenly have such a thought? No, this wasn't a sudden thought; it was the influence of the path. It seemed like the path was influencing him, making him call Su Yu his grandfather? Damn it! How could this be possible? This was a path left by the Culture King, who had disappeared over a hundred thousand years ago. How could he have left something like this in the path? Even if he did, it couldn't possibly be this!

Liu Hong was utterly shocked, looking around. Was Su Yu nearby? Was he influencing him? Meanwhile, the death spirit monarch in the distance stared blankly at the suddenly startled Liu Hong, then quickly sank into the Celestial River of Death and disappeared. Liu Hong wanted to chase after it but quickly gave up, feeling uneasy. What was going on?

Just then, another sentence appeared in his mind, "Quick, shout it out loud, or heavenly punishment will surely descend!" Shout your ancestor! Liu Hong cursed inwardly. It must be Su Yu messing with him. Was he nearby? This guy was a bit terrifying. Had he influenced his path? I can't afford to provoke him, but I can avoid him, right? Run!

Just as he was about to flee, a thunderous roar erupted in his mind, the sound of world-ending thunder. Liu Hong's face turned pale, and the next moment, he hurriedly said, "Brother, I'll call you brother, just stop messing with me!"

At that moment, there was no further movement.

...

In the Death Realm's path, Su Yu threw a few more characters and illusions, which were absorbed by the tributary. Su Yu chuckled, unsure if Liu Hong had received the messages, but it was quite amusing. Forget it, he wouldn't play with him anymore; it was too consuming and unnecessary. However, seeing this path gave him some ideas.

Could he also open a path here? "No, I don't have the ability to open a path, but..." Su Yu held the death spirit page, his eyes flickering. "I can place this death spirit page into the path to siphon power! Siphon the power of the Death Realm's path. Anyway, this path is terrifyingly strong. Siphoning a bit won't be noticeable! As long as it's not discovered and destroyed!"

"Using an illusory path to absorb death energy and replace it!" "The Culture King used path creation to siphon power. I can completely fake it, using this illusory path to steal power!" "No, actually, it's best to parasitize in the path of a strong individual!"

Su Yu thought, his eyes flickering continuously. Parasitize! Yes, place his death spirit page into the path of a strong individual, parasitize, and even let the other party actively use his illusory path to absorb power, making them mistakenly believe they are incredibly powerful, and then he could retrieve it at any time!

"In this way, I can have someone help me nurture the death spirit page!" Countless thoughts were born in Su Yu's mind. He continued forward, wanting to understand more about the Death Realm's path. This super strong individual's path was now open to him, and Su Yu wanted to see how it was done, how it detached from the River of Time and became its own path.

"What does it take to maintain these powers without exhaustion?" "What did the Culture King mean by saying that all changes do not depart from their origin?" With these questions, Su Yu continued forward. It was getting increasingly difficult!

And Su Yu, underfoot, seemed to see more river water containing figures. A drop of water, a path integrated with a death spirit. Some were incredibly powerful, some seemed to be dormant, and some auras were already revealed.

"The Death Realm has accumulated countless years, and there are indeed many strong individuals." Su Yu sighed in his heart. If the owner of the Death Realm's path were still around, they could instantly unify the Death Realm, awakening all the dormant existences. The strength of the Death Realm wouldn't be weak!

"The key is to strengthen myself!" He didn't care how strong this individual was; Su Yu only thought about making himself stronger. Finding someone to nurture his death spirit page was a very good choice. However, doing it silently without being discovered was still challenging.

"Perhaps, other paths can also be done this way!" Su Yu's eyes flickered continuously. He could actually split the pages of the Mark of Civilization and siphon the power of those paths. Let others help him nurture the pages!

"Now that there are no rulers of laws, and the River of Time cannot be freely traversed, what do they know?" This was an opportunity! Without a ruler of laws, no one could open the Heaven Gate, making it difficult for them to discover these things.

"I can even use fake paths to replace real paths, letting the myriad races integrate with fake paths!" Integrate with the fake paths in my Mark of Civilization! Su Yu inhaled sharply. Am I too wicked? This is going to trap all the cultivators of the myriad races!

This time, entering the Death Realm's path gave him countless ideas. As he continued forward, Su Yu seemed to see a drop of stronger river water, with a figure suspended above it. It was the path of a death spirit marquis. Su Yu's eyes flickered. A death spirit marquis. This didn't seem to be under his command. Was it... under the North King's command?

He carefully identified it. Although death spirits all looked the same, he could roughly identify it. Maybe... it really was a death spirit marquis under the North King's command. "Let's give it a try!" Su Yu reached out to grab this drop of water, but it was incredibly powerful, suddenly spewing a large amount of death energy, eroding Su Yu, and the drop of water struck Su Yu, causing him to retreat instantly!

...

While Su Yu was attempting to capture this strong individual's path, in the Land of the Abyss, the North King had also established a palace there. In a newly established palace, a death spirit marquis suddenly opened his eyes, and the power of the path erupted. Soon, several death spirit marquises rushed over, each extremely vigilant. The North King quickly arrived and shouted, "Marquis Longxue, what's wrong?"

Marquis Longxue frowned slightly, sitting cross-legged, the power of the path still erupting. He said in a deep voice, "It seems like there's a crisis. I feel my path's power colliding with that of another strong individual!"

The North King was slightly taken aback, then quickly said in a deep voice, "Could it be that a strong individual is trying to kill you from a distance using the power of the path?"

He also quickly vibrated his path's power, sweeping across the surroundings, but found nothing. He frowned slightly and said, "Is it at the source of the path?"

"Possibly." Marquis Longxue sensed it and felt the same. The North King frowned, then said after a moment, "It might be a path collision. Someone is trying to increase their strength by squeezing your path's area. Defend with all your might! Recently, both death spirit marquises and heavenly kings have fallen. Some guys want to take the opportunity to seize more path power. The dead can be seized, but the living, it's difficult! As long as you defend with all your might, the other party will give up after failing to break through for a long time!"

Marquis Longxue nodded. "I don't know who it is. To seize a path area in the Death Realm's path, could it be a heavenly king? The South King?"

"Possibly!" The North King thought for a moment, then glanced into the depths. Besides the South King, maybe there were others. Those guys weren't easy to deal with either. He quickly said, "Be careful. As long as you're alive, it's almost impossible for the other party to seize your path area! After all, you can fuse with the path, which means you've already turned a region into yours! You might even counterattack the other party. Stop talking and counterattack with all your might! If the other party is trying to seize your path from a distance, even a heavenly king might be counterattacked by you!"

Marquis Longxue's heart moved. Could he counter-devour the other party? He quickly manipulated the power of the path, erupting rapidly.

...

At this time, in the Death Realm's path, Su Yu was being beaten back repeatedly. Su Yu was also grimacing. "Indeed, trying to kill a marquis here isn't that simple. It's better to kill them in reality! The other party has the initiative, and this is also their territory. I'm just an outsider!"

Su Yu quickly retreated. It was not easy to provoke. If it didn't work, he would switch to another monarch. Just as he thought of this, in the path, the illusory death spirit figure suddenly lunged at him, seemingly trying to devour Su Yu.

"Discovered and starting to counterattack?" Su Yu judged, just about to dodge, when his eyes suddenly moved. The next moment, a phantom appeared on his death spirit page, formed from Su Yu's own blood essence.

At this moment, the undead Su Yu suddenly manifested a small, illusory Celestial River of Death in his hand. Manipulating the pages of the Book of the Dead, this undead version of Su Yu wielded the tiny river, charging towards the Marquis with ferocity. The opponent, equally fierce, opened his mouth wide, attempting to devour Su Yu's phantom.

Su Yu didn't resist much, allowing the opponent to consume him. His book pages, phantoms, and the illusory Celestial River of Death were all being swallowed. The phantom of the Dragonblood Marquis grew slightly stronger as a result.

After a long while, with a thunderous sound, the entire page of the Book of the Dead vanished. Su Yu could vaguely see that this page was now enveloped within the river that surrounded the phantom of the Dragonblood Marquis. His illusory path had been devoured by the opponent!

Su Yu quickly retreated, his eyes flickering with amusement. "Swallowed it, did you? Not everything can be eaten so recklessly!"

The phantom of the Dragonblood Marquis, having devoured the illusion, circled around for a bit. Sensing no further danger, it transformed into a droplet of water, merging into the river. Its aura, however, grew increasingly powerful.

...

In the Land of the Abyss, the power of the Dragonblood Marquis's great path erupted briefly. After a while, his aura suddenly intensified before gradually calming down. Yet, his heart was in turmoil!

He had successfully counterattacked! Not only that, but he had also managed to bite back, devouring a significant amount of the opponent's necromantic power of laws!

At this moment, he vaguely felt as though he had touched upon something extraordinary. In his mind, a small river began to take shape.

"What is this?" The Dragonblood Marquis was shaken. Had he stumbled upon some great fortune? As he pondered, countless thoughts emerged in his mind. After a long time, he began to understand.

"Incredible, this... this is the seed of the Necromantic Great Path!" The Dragonblood Marquis realized, his heart filled with boundless shock. It seemed that during the recent battle, he had gained an immense opportunity, touching upon the essence of the Necromantic Great Path!

According to his understanding, the illusory river in his mind appeared to be the seed of the Necromantic Great Path, or to put it simply, the offspring of the Necromantic Great Path—a small necromantic path! By mastering this, he could strengthen his own great path power. One day, he might even become the Lord of the Necromancers, the master of the entire Death Realm!

The Dragonblood Marquis was utterly astounded. What exactly had he devoured just now? Who had dared to invade him, only to be repelled and have such a treasure stripped away?

Unbelievable!

At this moment, seeing that he had calmed down, the North King quickly asked, "How did it go?"

Suppressing his inner turmoil, the Dragonblood Marquis quickly replied, "I've repelled the opponent. They've retreated. Even if they're not dead, they should be heavily injured. I even managed to devour some of their necromantic power of laws, which has made me stronger!"

The North King smiled at this. "That's normal. Battles of the great paths are the most perilous! For someone to invade the domain of a living necromancer marquis, unless they're a master of laws, it's hard to escape unscathed! So, in the Death Realm, it's best not to engage in battles of the great paths. Everyone is on the same path, making it difficult to suppress one another with laws."

The Dragonblood Marquis nodded, smiling. "It might have been a strong figure who just revived from the Celestial River of Death, not quite clear-headed."

Hearing this, the others agreed. Someone laughed, "The Dragonblood Marquis is quite lucky, even gaining an advantage. Next time, if there's another foolish newly revived, let them devour me too. I want to try the backlash of the great path!"

Everyone laughed.

The Dragonblood Marquis chuckled along, but his heart remained deeply shaken. It seemed he had become the child of the Death Realm, with the Necromantic Great Path leaving behind a seed for him to inherit.

"I need to keep devouring others' great path powers!" The Dragonblood Marquis thought, suddenly feeling an uncontrollable urge. He wanted to eliminate these fellows to perfect his small necromantic path. Perhaps he could quickly become a Heavenly King-level expert, or even a quasi-king, or... a master of laws!

"A heaven-sent opportunity, no, I understand now!" The Dragonblood Marquis's heart trembled once more. He began to realize that with the Human Realm's renewed invasion, the Necromantic Great Path was preparing to counterattack. Thus, this domain had birthed a child of the realm, destined by fate!

"The great path has a spirit. Is the Necromantic Great Path nurturing someone to rival Su Yu?" Thoughts raced through his mind, and the Dragonblood Marquis was filled with excitement.

It seemed he had been chosen as the representative of the Necromantic Great Path!

Heavenly King, master of laws—these thoughts kept surfacing. He glanced at the others, seeing they were unaware, and secretly plotted to find an opportunity to go out and kill some strong individuals, devouring their great path powers.

Perhaps he could grow rapidly!

"And the Land of Seals, with so many strong individuals—if I could devour them all... and then devour these fellows, all power would return to me alone!"

His ambition suddenly swelled to the extreme!

Unbeknownst to him, above his head, in the great path, a small river appeared faintly. Within the river, a figure sat cross-legged, muttering incessantly, "Devour everything, I am destiny! Unite the heavens, the myriad races shall bow!"

Subtly influencing him!

This was the result Su Yu desired. He wanted to attempt something new. To see if he could use this method to have the one who devoured his Book of the Dead go on to assassinate others, devour them, and ultimately serve as his tool!

If successful, Su Yu could replicate this strategy with other pages, saving time and effort compared to strengthening himself directly!

...

At this moment, within the Necromantic Great Path, Su Yu was heavily injured. He considered pressing forward but ultimately chose to retreat. He wanted to see if the one who had taken his page would make any moves next.

Moreover, Su Yu had begun to think of more possibilities. A terrifying thought crossed his mind, one he dared not dwell on deeply.
