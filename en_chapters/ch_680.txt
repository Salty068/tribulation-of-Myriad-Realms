Chapter 680: Everyone Takes Action (Please Subscribe)

"Martial Emperor, enough is enough!"

In the void, Su Yu shouted, "Do you really think I can't deal with you? You haven't fully unsealed yet. I'm just too lazy to waste my energy on you. But if you keep pushing it, believe me, I'll gather all my strength and kill you first!"

The Martial Emperor snorted coldly, throwing a punch that shattered the void. There wasn't much power of laws in it, as his power of laws was sealed. Yet, even without it, a mere shadow punch was enough to make the pen dao tremble.

"Kill me?" The Martial Emperor chuckled softly, "You can try."

"Still not giving up, are you?" Su Yu suddenly took out a seal, which burst into brilliant light. The Martial Emperor's shadow paused, and Su Yu sneered, "Want to try again? Do you recognize what this is?"

The Martial Emperor's shadow halted its attack, looking at Su Yu and the seal in his hand. After a long while, he said coldly, "The path of sanctification?"

Su Yu snorted.

"It's good that you recognize it. Can you withstand this in your current state? I'm just reluctant to waste it on you! Don't think I can't deal with you!"

The Martial Emperor's tone was equally cold, "It's a good item, but at most, it can only affect me slightly. You can't break my physical body or sever my dao. At worst, it will just delay my unsealing for a while longer!"

Despite his words, he gave up on continuing to tangle with Su Yu.

Su Yu ignored him, covering the world with the Mark of Civilization. Countless broken strands of hair were absorbed into the Mark of Civilization.

The Martial Emperor's face darkened, "What are you doing?"

"Making use of waste!" Su Yu said indifferently, "You should shave your head. These broken hairs are polluting the ground. I'm just helping you clean up."

The Martial Emperor looked at Su Yu with a cold gaze, "Do you take me for a fool? This wretch, breaking my hair and then wanting to take it as material for weapon forging? Despicable! Detestable!"

In the Martial Emperor's eyes, the first to be killed should be Taishan, and the second was Su Yu. This guy was not only annoying but also shameless!

Su Yu paid him no mind, secretly astonished. This was merely the Martial Emperor's projection, without the power of laws. The shadow only used some acupoint power, yet it could fight him to a standstill. Su Yu didn't dare claim he had reached the Heavenly King level, but with his current use of the pen dao, he should be considered above average among the Daofuse.

If he had to compare, he should be at the level of the Hou Pseudo Emperor. These ancient semi-emperors were all strong.

The first tier was the Heavenly King level. The second tier included Old Turtle, Tiangu, Heavenly Overseer Marquis, Great Zhou King, and Doubao, all at the peak of Daofuse, though Doubao was slightly weaker. The third tier included Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Jiwu, and Demon Halberd. The fourth tier was the Hou Pseudo Emperor and Phoenix Emperor. The fifth tier included Demon Leap and Heavendoom. There was even a sixth tier, consisting of those who had just advanced to Daofuse or some necromancer marquises.

Of course, within the same tier, there were differences. Old Turtle was much stronger than Doubao, truly close to the Heavenly King level.

Su Yu marveled at how the Martial Emperor's mere projection, without using the power of laws, could contend with him. If he used the power of laws, how unimaginably strong would he be?

Could he use his power of laws? Or was it completely sealed? Or perhaps, once he used the power of laws, he would be sealed again to a muddled state. These were hard to judge at the moment. Since the opponent hadn't used the power of laws, Su Yu couldn't detect where his dao was.

Thinking about these things, Su Yu ignored the Martial Emperor and quickly looked at the crowd absorbing the power of laws. He was slightly stunned.

At his side, Marquis Lanshan, Hetu, and Marquis Tongtian quickly arrived. At this moment, they all saw the Martial Emperor's shadow. Unlike before, when they couldn't see the shadow, they were now very vigilant and solemn, guarding around Su Yu.

Su Yu didn't say much, looking at Shan Qi and the others, somewhat surprised, "How did you do it?"

He thought that in this battle against Cangshan Ming, no matter what, a few would die. Even if they won, there would be casualties. Su Yu was prepared for three to five deaths, which was normal. Seven or eight deaths could be understood. But... not a single one died. What was going on?

Yes, it seemed none had died. Although all 27 guardians were injured, and the injuries were not light, they were currently absorbing the power of laws to recover. But not dying was not dying. Serious injuries were not a concern.

How was this possible! Su Yu found it hard to believe. He looked at Marquis Lanshan and the others, "Did you intervene?"

Marquis Tongtian, seeing Su Yu's gaze, hurriedly said, "Emperor Yu, we didn't intervene! Don't look at us like that, as if suspecting we intervened. We really didn't. We followed your orders. Don't overthink it..."

Su Yu frowned, "Get to the point!"

Marquis Tongtian instantly shut his mouth. At this moment, Hetu smiled and said, "It has little to do with us. During the battle with Cangshan Ming, something went wrong."

"Something went wrong?" Su Yu was puzzled. What went wrong?

Hetu quickly said, "Not just him. Just a moment ago, everyone experienced some minor issues, which quickly disappeared! We weren't fighting, so it didn't affect us much. Perhaps there was a problem with the necromancer dao, and suddenly everything went black..."

"Everything went black?" Su Yu was extremely surprised. How could that be! At this level, how could everything suddenly go black? The necromancer dao was already dark enough. What else could make necromancers go black?

He had rushed in earlier and hadn't asked the Southern King about the situation. Hearing this now, he couldn't help but frown. During a great battle, everything suddenly went black. What was going on?

Marquis Lanshan also sensed something and said, "It was as if everything suddenly went black. Our dao fluctuations weren't severe, so the impact might not have been too great. But Cangshan Ming was in a fierce battle and heavily injured. If he experienced the same, he might have been momentarily deprived of his six senses! Specifically, we're not too sure."

They weren't sure, but the Martial Emperor sneered coldly, "Just interference with the dao! A parasite seized the opportunity to secretly devour the power of the dao!"

"Parasite?" Su Yu looked at him, and the Martial Emperor mocked, "Who else but you so-called civilized masters would do such things? A bunch of shameless people, what wouldn't you do? Secretly opening tributaries on the dao to steal mainstream power and usurp the host. This isn't the first time you've done it!"

Su Yu pondered slightly, his eyes flickering, "A tributary... treating the necromancer dao as the River of Time, opening a tributary on the dao to steal power and usurp the host!"

He understood!

Su Yu's eyes sparkled, "The Ink Dao?"

"Ink Dao?" The Martial Emperor thought for a moment, then sneered, "So it's that path. Before I was sealed, I vaguely heard of it but never saw it! I wondered who had such capability. So it's him! The Ink Dao... quite the method! Stealing the power of the necromancer dao rules, trying to control the necromancer dao?"

It's the Ink Dao!

Su Yu largely confirmed it. It's the Ink Dao inherited from the Culture King. The Ink Dao isn't connected to the River of Time! All other daos, except the necromancer dao and the Time Sage's time dao, are tributaries of the River of Time. But this time, the Culture King treated the necromancer dao as the River of Time. He actually opened a tributary on the necromancer dao. Is this tributary strong? Definitely not strong!

Su Yu thought so, but this dao had a function: to steal the power of the necromancer dao, aiming to usurp the host. The ultimate goal wasn't anything else but to seize control of the necromancer dao!

In other words, if one mastered the dao through the Ink Dao and became the master of the rules, even if they succeeded, they would be very weak. Perhaps the weakest among the masters of the rules, because it wasn't based on the River of Time but the River of Death!

No matter how strong the necromancer dao is, it's not as strong as the River of Time! Other daos are considered secondary branches, while the Ink Dao is a tertiary branch, more akin to some virtual daos collected in the Book of Time.

At this moment, Su Yu had a thousand thoughts. Was it Liu Hong who fused the dao? Just when Cangshan Ming's dao was fluctuating intensely, did that guy seize the opportunity to invade the necromancer dao's power of rules, or extract these powers to strengthen his tributary? Was it Liu Hong?

If so, it's too fast!

Su Yu was secretly shocked! The Ink Dao is a dao of the necromancer realm, possibly the only tributary dao. Is that so? He didn't see it, but if he did, he might have some sense of it. The Martial Emperor might have seen it because Cangshan Ming was fighting fiercely at the time.

Su Yu thought about it and quickly sneered, "Usurp the host? Steal power? Shameless? Ridiculous! In today's world, who isn't stealing the power of the River of Time! Martial Emperor, sometimes you're adorably naive! If the River of Time itself is a dao, tell me, have you not stolen power? Yet you have the nerve to mock this and that! If the River of Death is treated as the River of Time, it only means the Ink Dao is the first dao opened on the River of Death!"

"Back then, when the Lord of the Necromancers opened the Death Realm, was it not to have everyone integrate into his dao? Was it not to create his own River of Time, with countless tributaries on his dao?"

"If he had such ambition, then someone opening a dao is actually an acknowledgment of him. What do you understand!"

Su Yu curled his lips, and the Martial Emperor sneered, "What you see, I can see too! These two are not the same concept! The daos on the River of Time are just branches, while this dao wants to usurp the host..."

Su Yu laughed, "So naive! If I could control the River of Time, I would usurp the host too! Martial Emperor, if you don't have such thoughts, it only means you're incompetent, with too low a vision! Only focusing on your own little patch of land, probably your biggest ambition is to expand your dao to the level of the physical body dao, right?"

The Martial Emperor's face darkened, remaining silent.

Su Yu mocked, "I must have hit the mark! Your greatest ambition in life might just be to catch up with the Martial King. Perhaps you think that having a path as wide as the Martial King's is enough. If you have a higher aspiration, it might be to make your own path as broad as the physical path. But I bet you've never thought of creating a new path altogether, have you?"

The Martial Emperor looked at Su Yu for a long time before he chuckled softly, "The young are fearless, brimming with youthful arrogance. In my younger days, I too had such dreams. When I first opened the Heaven Gate, I believed no one in the world could rival me! I thought I would eventually control this Time Path, with all paths bowing to me!"

He was once a prodigy, one of the few who could open the Heaven Gate. Who wouldn't dream of becoming the master of the River of Time upon first seeing it and its myriad paths?

But once you open a path and try to strengthen it, you realize just how difficult it truly is!

The Martial Emperor smiled wistfully, "Now, you're merely walking the path of others, Su Yu. Once you master this pen dao, then consider how to expand it, how to devour the River of Time! By then, you'll understand just how naive and laughable your current thoughts are! Like an ant trying to shake a tree, overestimating your own abilities!"

Su Yu didn't argue. Some things were indeed hard to articulate. The ideas were grand, the dreams lofty, but after tens of thousands of years without progress, even the highest ambitions would be worn down.

The Martial Emperor's spirit had clearly been worn down!

However, Su Yu had gleaned some insights. The ink dao had been controlled—not controlled, perhaps integrated. Liu Hong, that cunning fellow, had seized the opportunity, sensing the fluctuations of Cangshan Ming's path, and might have secretly stolen some of its power!

"That cunning guy, always the same. Last time he tricked me into thinking he was just retrieving a key, claiming the treasure was on the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

Su Yu cursed inwardly, but this time, Liu Hong's theft inadvertently helped the guardians.

As for whether this would affect the guardians' dao hearts... let's not kid ourselves. It was an accident. In the chaos of battle, unexpected events happen, and there are no babysitters to help you.

Even Su Yu hadn't anticipated this accident.

What puzzled Su Yu more was whether the ink dao could influence many undead.

The ink dao, tainting the undead path—previously, the South Heavenly King mentioned that resurrection was related to the paths of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone. Now, Su Yu wondered if this ink dao could truly strip the undead powerhouses of their paths.

If so, Liu Hong could be called a slayer of the undead!

He definitely had a knack for dealing with the undead!

"But... I still don't know what he's up to. I always feel like he has his own agenda."

Su Yu mused for a while, then glanced at the guardians still absorbing power, feeling slightly relieved.

A favorable outcome!

Destiny is on my side!

At this critical moment, Cangshan Ming's power was partially stolen, leading to a loss of his six senses. In a life-and-death struggle, losing one's senses makes survival nearly impossible!

Su Yu looked at a shattered undead mark nearby, his eyes flickering as he spoke, "General Shan Qi, can I distribute Cangshan Ming's undead mark and some remnants to the undead?"

Shan Qi, who was healing, quickly opened his eyes and said solemnly, "Emperor Yu, distribute as you see fit. If not for your opportunity, Cangshan Ming would have been slain long ago!"

"Thank you!"

Su Yu reached out, and a crystalline mark appeared in his hand. With a wave, the Mark of Civilization absorbed the surroundings, instantly gathering black blood, death energy, fragments of dao bodies, and more.

Moments later, the remnants in Su Yu's hand condensed into three drops of blood essence.

One mark, three drops of blood essence, all from a Heavenly King-level powerhouse.

Su Yu also had a drop of East King blood and a drop of West King blood, totaling five drops of blood essence and one mark.

He looked at Hetu and Marquis Lanshan. Marquis Lanshan wasn't weak, but her aptitude seemed lacking. Hetu had good potential; if he absorbed these, he might advance further.

Even if he couldn't reach the Heavenly King level, he might enter the third or second tier.

For the undead, progress was somewhat simpler.

At this moment, Marquis Lanshan was roughly on par with Su Yu, stronger than some undead marquises, close to the third tier, slightly weaker than the Great Qin King and others.

Who should he give it to?

Su Yu could keep it for himself, but he preferred these two to advance, to seize some undead path power, preventing the North King and others from growing stronger or birthing even more powerful beings!

After a brief hesitation, Su Yu gave everything to Marquis Lanshan, "Absorb it. Even if you don't reach the Heavenly King level, deepening your understanding of the undead path will surely elevate you to the top-tier Daofuse level!"

Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at Hetu, who didn't seem to mind.

Marquis Lanshan wasn't foolish. After a moment of silence, she suddenly said, "Your Majesty, give it to Hetu! His aptitude is better than mine, and he progresses faster. He has a better chance of becoming the next Heavenly King..."

Su Yu replied calmly, "Don't question my words! Hetu will have his chance later. Now, eat it, quickly! While the dao is shaking, it's best to comprehend and swiftly devour! There are many battles ahead; today is just the appetizer!"

Marquis Lanshan hesitated but eventually accepted all the blood essence and the mark, asking, "Your Majesty, won't you keep a few drops?"

Su Yu smiled, "No need!"

"But..."

"Absorb, cultivate, less talk!"

"Understood!"

Marquis Lanshan sat cross-legged, beginning to devour the blood essence and undead mark.

Hetu remained silent, and Su Yu said nothing either. However, Marquis Tongtian, standing nearby, rolled his eyes and chuckled, "Emperor Yu is wise. This Hetu clearly has many thoughts, not a good heart, while Marquis Lanshan is sincere and loyal!"

"…"

Su Yu glanced at him, silently warning him to speak properly, or risk losing his mouth.

Marquis Tongtian chuckled awkwardly, "I'm just trying to lighten the mood. Did I hit the nail on the head?"

He decided not to expose Su Yu's thoughts and quickly consoled Hetu, "Little Hetu, it's okay. Next time will be your turn. Your ancestor, King Gong, would be very pleased. By the way, your ancestor loved chatting with me. We could talk for a year straight. Once Emperor Yu unifies the world, how about we become neighbors again?"

"…"

Hetu felt exhausted.

I don't want to talk to you. Can you just shut up?

Did my ancestor really enjoy chatting with you?

If so, he must have been too idle, too bored!

At this moment, among the guardians, someone experienced a surge of dao power, a fluctuation of the power of laws. Moments later, Shan Qi, who was already strong, fully recovered from his injuries. Not only that, but a path appeared above his head.

Shan Qi's dao power rapidly climbed, crossing a chasm in an instant, transforming his aura. He had fused his dao!

As soon as Shan Qi fused his dao, he quickly exited the pillar of light and flew towards Su Yu, bowing, "Shan Qi of the Spirit Suppression Army greets Your Majesty. I have fused my dao, thanks to Your Majesty's grace!"

Su Yu smiled!

"No need to thank me. You killed Cangshan Ming yourselves, so you received more rewards, even more than Heavendoom and the others, who ultimately failed to kill a Heavenly King."

Shan Qi said nothing, knowing it was different.

Su Yu glanced over again and asked, "How many do you think can fuse their dao?"

Shan Qi looked over and replied, "Besides me, there are probably five more. Those who were stuck at the ninth stage! The other brothers have just advanced to the ninth stage, so fusing their dao is very difficult!"

Su Yu nodded. Besides Shan Qi, there were also Di Dang, Zhan Qiong, Zhou Chi, Shuang Ying, and Huang Ji among the guardians, who were previously at the ninth stage.

According to Shan Qi, besides him, these five had a chance to advance to Daofuse.

Shan Qi continued, somewhat regretfully, "Chang Ping didn't come. Otherwise, Chang Ping and Hai Zang, both at the ninth stage, might have had a chance to advance!"

Among the five guardians who left, two were also at the ninth stage, not weak.

If they had come, the chances of these two advancing would have been high.

Su Yu said nothing.

Everyone has their own aspirations.

Advancing to Daofuse means becoming stronger, but it also means facing greater dangers and stronger enemies.

Su Yu waited silently.

The results were as expected.

The other 21 guardians only solidified their ninth-stage advancements without advancing further, while Zhan Qiong and the other five all advanced. One Cangshan Ming resulted in six Daofuse advancements, which was quite good!

At this point, just among the guardians, including Old Turtle, there were ten Daofuse-level beings and 21 at the ninth stage!

In the South Heavenly King's faction, besides the South Heavenly King, there were ten undead marquises.

Hetu and these people, counting Marquis Lanshan's side, had two newly advanced undead marquises outside, plus the previous three, Hetu and Marquis Lanshan, totaling seven undead marquises.

In the entire Death Realm, counting the South Heavenly King, there were 18 undead marquises. No, Xia Chen should have advanced too, making it 19!

"On the human side, the Great Zhou King, Great Xia King, Great Qin King, Tian Yue, and the Great Ming King entered earlier. I feel they're almost there. If they advance, the humans will have five Daofuse!"

"Double Ball, Fat Ball, the Space Ancient Beast, the Hou Race, June, September, the Ancient Giant, that's also ten."

"If Big Wood also transforms, plus Marquis Tongtian, that's two more."

Counting it all, across the realms of life and death, excluding Su Yu himself, Su Yu's forces might have reached 44 Daofuse-level beings!

Of course, some couldn't be used, like Marquis Tongtian who couldn't leave, or undead who couldn't be used in the realm of the living.

Even so, Su Yu was filled with emotion.

From a time when a single Daofuse was hard to find, to now, where Daofuse-level forces under his command were constantly emerging, although there was still a gap with the Upper Realm, at least there was hope in sight!

The other 21 guardians might also have a chance to advance, as they had captured some undead marquises.

Su Yu contemplated the situation with the Five Elemental Race. Although they didn't have any Daofuse cultivators, their two groups combined could rival two Daofuse experts.

Reflecting on this, Su Yu quickly decided, "We've captured several Death Spirit Marquis. Although the rewards for capturing them are less, let's try concentrating on one. See if we can push one to reach Daofuse! It won't delay us. Kill the Death Spirit Marquis and let Marquis Lanshan absorb the marks. Maybe it will help him reach the Heavenly King Realm!"

Having captured several, Su Yu believed that killing them might still provide a chance for someone to advance.

Of course, these individuals hoped to advance through battle, experiencing life and death. Haven't they already experienced it? Now, killing the Death Spirit Marquis is just to supplement them with some power of laws. Let's give it a try!

Soon, Su Yu teleported away.

Upon returning, the Luminous Domain Mansion felt almost like his own home. He could come and go as he pleased. The Martial Emperor didn't really want to let him in, but Su Yu had previously taken out the Sanctification Seal, which made the Martial Emperor wary, so he chose to ignore him.

Su Yu continued extracting the power of laws here. The more he extracted, the stronger the power he could wield!

...

Another round of slaughter ensued!

Among the guardians, Dou Kou was responsible for the killings. He had previously been at the eighth stage, later advancing to the ninth stage by killing a monarch. At this moment, he absorbed a lot of the power of laws rewarded after Cangshan Ming's death.

After consecutively killing three Marquis, he still couldn't advance, mainly because these Marquis were all severely injured. Capturing Death Spirit Marquis couldn't yield such intact ones.

It wasn't until the fourth Marquis was killed that Dou Kou finally advanced to Daofuse.

However, it was evident that he felt weaker compared to Shan Qi and the others.

There was no choice. Su Yu had to abandon the idea of continuing to capture Death Spirit Marquis. Killing too many could easily create powerful death spirits. The key was that the rewards were too little since they weren't killed by him alone.

Some of his ideas were dashed again. He could only rely on them to see if they could kill some strong enemies later!

Nevertheless, they had gained another Daofuse cultivator.

That was already quite good!

However, there was also a troublesome matter. These guys had all broken the petrification technique, so they couldn't stay in the Death Realm any longer. They had to leave quickly. Once the petrification technique was broken, the aura of life was too strong!

Su Yu didn't want to provoke the death spirits in the Celestial River of Death again, causing some death spirits to revive.

...

Meanwhile, Marquis Lanshan had devoured a large number of Death Spirit Marquis marks and the blood essence of several Heavenly Kings.

He had almost exhausted Su Yu's death spirit resources. After about a day, Marquis Lanshan finally woke up, having digested quite a bit, and his aura had significantly improved.

To Su Yu, Marquis Lanshan now seemed no weaker than the Great Qin King and the others, vaguely approaching the level of Old Turtle.

However... he still hadn't reached the expected level.

Su Yu felt a bit regretful. Marquis Lanshan had consumed so many treasures, yet at this rate, advancing to the Heavenly King level might require continuous grinding.

The path for death spirits to advance wasn't abundant.

Either they were powerful in life, had exceptional comprehension, or relied on devouring strong marks and blood essence. Marquis Lanshan's comprehension was average, and his foundation in life had been exhausted. To become a Heavenly King, he could only hope to devour more treasures in the future.

Su Yu didn't linger. He needed to take the guardians away.

He didn't teleport away from the Yuan Aperture, as appearing in the Sea of Stars would be too conspicuous.

He continued through the Death Realm. Although the aura of life was strong, it might stimulate some strong beings to revive, but if they moved fast enough, not many would revive.

...

In a swift journey.

Su Yu sent all the guardians back to Grand Dream City.

At this moment, Grand Dream City had gathered a large number of Daofuse combat forces.

The formation set up by the West King's Consort on the periphery was almost bursting due to these Daofuse cultivators, and that was with everyone restraining themselves.

Moreover, the Great Ming King was constantly reinforcing it!

If not for that, the myriad realms would have long been aware of it. The aura of Daofuse was too strong, and with so many beings, even a slight display could easily cause a tremor in the Great Dao.

At this moment, anyone thinking of launching a surprise attack on Old Turtle would be courting death!

A Heavenly King, two, or three might all be killed!

...

Su Yu was continuously accumulating strength.

Meanwhile, the myriad races were also accelerating their plans.

Just as Su Yu sent the guardians back to Grand Dream City, the Immortal Realm, Devil Realm, Divine Realm... all realms were quietly, in utmost secrecy, allowing a large number of Sunmoon cultivators to prove their Dao!

It didn't matter whether they succeeded or not!

It was irrelevant!

As long as they consumed a large amount of the power of laws!

...

In the Fate Realm.

The Fate Emperor frowned, once again ascending Destiny Mountain. The illusory passage above was becoming increasingly clear, and the punitive power within was slowly being consumed and also being born.

At this moment, Abyssal Marquis stared at the Fate Emperor, speaking coldly, "Wuming, this matter is extremely important. If you have nothing else, stay here with me and watch!"

The Fate Emperor frowned.

Abyssal Marquis said eerily, "This is not just my opinion, but the opinion of the gods, demons, immortals, dragons, and phoenixes! No matter how strong the Fate Race is, you must consider it. Neutral... then stay truly neutral!"

The Fate Emperor said nothing.

He knew he couldn't leave, nor could he continue leaking information, because if discovered, he would be in big trouble!

The various races had gone mad!

They were secretly consuming the foundations of each race, and there must be a large number of Sunmoon cultivators proving their Dao, not just one or two!

The various races might lose over a hundred Sunmoon peak cultivators!

Such losses, in exchange for some Daofuse descending, if exposed, the myriad races would not let him off.

At this moment, thunder roared continuously in the void passage!

After a long time, two powerful beings, carrying some injuries, descended from the sky.

One was shrouded in demonic flames, the other in immortal aura!

Strong beings from the Demon Race and Immortal Race!

Abyssal Marquis glanced at them, somewhat shocked, and quickly said, "Falling Star Marquis, Demon Rampage Marquis!"

Two ancient Marquis!

He was also an ancient Marquis, but the Immortal and Demon races were powerful, and in ancient times, they had many Daofuse cultivators, but not all could be conferred as Marquis, only the strong ones among them.

Every tidal change, the Immortals and Demons would give birth to some Daofuse cultivators.

Like the Soldier King and Talisman King, but compared to these ancient Marquis, they were much weaker.

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis who descended earlier was also not as strong as these two.

This time, it was actually two ancient Marquis from the two major races descending!

Don't be fooled by Su Yu's actions in the Death Realm, where he caused the Immortal and Demon Death Spirit Marquis to collapse. Those were dead beings. The living were much stronger than the dead, especially those who had survived until now.

The Fate Emperor was surprised, nodding slightly to the two ancient Marquis, and asked, "No strong beings from the Divine Race descended?"

The Divine Race was indeed low-key.

Now both the Immortals and Demons had three Daofuse cultivators each, what was the Divine Race thinking, still only having Jiwu?

The two ancient Marquis glanced at him, and the Demon Race's Demon Rampage Marquis sneered, "The Divine Race? Those guys are waiting for us to be consumed! A bunch of idiots! Forget about them, next time they will definitely have someone descend! If they don't, let the Divine Race be destroyed!"

After speaking, he looked at Abyssal Marquis and said coldly, "Shall we attack the Human Realm now?"

"No!"

Abyssal Marquis hurriedly said, "Tiangu's intention is for the two of you to wait here. If you make a move, it must be a thunderous strike! We can't let those guys escape. It's best to wait for the Upper Realm to open! At this moment, everyone's purpose here is not to destroy the Human Race, but to prevent the Human Race from being cornered! If an accident occurs, you all will be the trump card of the myriad races!"

Demon Rampage Marquis said coldly, "Tiangu is still so timid. If it were up to me, I would simply kill them now. How many are there in this tidal change of the Human Race? As for those supporting the Human Race, once the strong of the Human Race are killed, they will surely scatter!"

Beside him, the Immortal Race's Falling Star Marquis chuckled, "Why are you in such a hurry! Let it drag on, Tiangu is cautious and not in a rush! It's fine, let it drag on a bit longer, see if they can encircle those guys above! They've been causing trouble for so many years, it's time to kill them all!"

The Fate Emperor raised his eyebrows slightly. These two clearly knew more than others.

He didn't speculate further, asking, "Two seniors, how many Daofuse cultivators of the Human Race haven't been eradicated?"

Falling Star Marquis smiled, nodding slightly, "There are still a few remnants, scattered and hiding in several dangerous places. A few days ago, we just killed Marquis Minshan, who had been on the run for years! The Minshan lineage is completely wiped out! Marquis Minshan was not weak, but unfortunately... he still couldn't hold out until the end!"

He smiled, but it was a cold smile.

The Fate Emperor was slightly shaken. Marquis Minshan was dead!

This...

Marquis Minshan was among the strongest remnants of the ancient Human Race, not weaker than Hongmeng. In the last tidal change, he was the greatest support for the Hundred Battle King, and one of the few top Human Marquis who fled to the Upper Realm!

He's dead?

The Fate Emperor's heart trembled. With Marquis Minshan's death, even if there were a few Human Marquis remnants in the Upper Realm, was there really hope to turn the tide?

He pondered, and Abyssal Marquis was also shocked, "Marquis Minshan was killed? How come I didn't know?"

Falling Star Marquis chuckled, "Previously, we were worried about the news leaking, letting the other remnants escape, so it wasn't spread! Now that we're down here, it doesn't matter."

Abyssal Marquis said nothing, still shocked, "With Marquis Minshan's death, the roots of the Human Race in the Upper Realm are probably severed. This tidal change seems... truly devoid of the Human Race!"

A bit of lament, "Marquis Minshan was one of the top beings who survived from ancient times. He's dead, and the destruction of the Human Race is only a matter of time."

Demon Rampage Marquis sneered, "An inevitable outcome! Minshan overestimated himself, fleeing for years, but ultimately couldn't escape death! It's a pity, if there were a few more old guys in the Human Race, the news of Minshan's death would have thrown them into chaos!"

He continued, sneering, "Inform Tiangu, doesn't he have many methods? Spread the news of Minshan's death to the Human Race. Are there any old relics in the Human Race who know Minshan?"

Abyssal Marquis laughed, "Probably, that Great Zhou King might be one!"

"That's best, spread the news, say you know it, with Minshan's death, let's see if they still have the will to fight!"

"Alright!"

...

Two Marquis descended from the Upper Realm.

Bringing with them a big piece of news.

The news spread quickly, reaching the Human Realm, as the Human Race now roamed freely across the Allheaven Battlefield. The Immortal Race wasted no time in passing on the message, neither concealing it nor finding any reason to do so. This was a blow meant to crush the morale of the Human Race.

The Marquis of Minshan in the Upper Realm had been slain!

...

Human Realm.

East Rift Valley.

The Great Zhou King trembled slightly, losing control of his strength, shattering the teacup in his hand.

The Marquis of Minshan... had fallen!

Around him, some of the Eternals looked puzzled. Who was the Marquis of Minshan? They truly did not know.

The Great Zhou King could not hide his grief. He did not want to speak, but seeing everyone looking at him, his loss of composure evident to all, he finally spoke with difficulty, "The Marquis of Minshan... one of the 360 ancient human marquises! The first war general under the Martial King!"

"He commanded the Minshan Guard, conquered thirty-eight minor realms, and slew seven Daofuse experts. He was also the left general under the first Human Lord of the First Tide, commanding half of the Human Race's forces during that tide..."

"In the Ninth Tide, he was the first war general under the Hundred Battle King, a top-tier Daofuse expert who once suppressed Hongmeng..."

In an instant, the entire hall fell silent.

The Great Zhou King was overwhelmed with sorrow. Even the Marquis of Minshan had fallen.

Could the Human Race... could Su Yu... really have any hope?

The excitement from before suddenly dissipated.

Previously, he had thought that if the Upper Realm opened, Su Yu would not be alone and unsupported. The Marquis of Minshan had not died last time; he might still be alive, as there had been no news of his demise.

But now, the Marquis of Minshan was dead!

How did he die?

The Marquis of Minshan was not only powerful but had lived for a long time. Crucially, he was not foolish; he would not engage in reckless battles. During the Ninth Tide, when defeat seemed imminent, he quickly led his men to retreat, preserving some of their forces.

With his death, the foundation in the Upper Realm might be lost!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King felt lost. Was there anyone left in the Upper Realm?
