Chapter 793: Stripping the Throne

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo and his companions had returned, carrying a massive mountain on their shoulders. This was the same mountain they had taken from Bamboo Mountain before, and now, in just a short month, they had brought it back.

The Marquis of Giant Bamboo, along with April, May, and Full Moon, were all brimming with excitement. Since Su Yu left the Upper Realm, the Iron Devourer Race had suffered greatly. They had feared becoming cannon fodder in the upcoming battles, but unexpectedly, Su Yu returned with overwhelming strength, compelling the myriad races to release the Iron Devourer Race back to them.

"Your Majesty!" From a distance, the Marquis of Giant Bamboo was already filled with excitement, and March was even more thrilled. They had returned! Although Bamboo Mountain was no longer in its original place, it was still Bamboo Mountain, and with March and Su Yu there, it was enough.

Su Yu also wore a smile. Before leaving the Upper Realm, he had met the Marquis of Giant Bamboo, who had promised to wait for Su Yu's return, pledging that the Iron Devourer Race would not serve another master unless Su Yu fell. March had always upheld this promise.

Thus, upon Su Yu's return, he immediately sought to bring back the Iron Devourer Race, preventing them from being used as leverage by the myriad races.

"We're back!" Su Yu smiled, gaining another Heavenly King under his command. April was a second-tier Daofuse expert, and May was at the peak of the third tier, adding considerable strength to his forces. With another Heavenly King, and Tongtian having just advanced to Heavenly King, Su Yu now had four Heavenly Sovereigns and three Heavenly Kings.

Having just arrived in the Upper Realm, his combat power had surged. Su Yu pondered whether he could launch a direct assault on the Control King's lineage, provided the myriad races were not a factor. If they were, a direct assault would not be wise.

"Giant Bamboo!" March was also delighted, looking at the mountain where over ten thousand Iron Devourers resided, all equally excited. The Iron Devourer Race wasn't vast in number, with over ten thousand, not much less than in the Lower Realm. If these ten thousand, including the Marquis of Giant Bamboo, were lost, it would be an immeasurable loss for the Iron Devourer Race.

Now, they had returned! The Iron Devourers were thrilled, having witnessed Su Yu's might and heard his threats to the myriad races, forcing them to return the Iron Devourers.

In an instant, over ten thousand Iron Devourers roared, "Greetings, Your Majesty!" Some were still gnawing on bamboo, others hanging from treetops, all roaring in unison, creating a somewhat comical yet invigorating scene.

Su Yu laughed heartily, "No need for formalities! Your return is a blessing for the Luminous Domain Mansion! Today, we cannot descend to the Lower Realm to reunite with the Iron Devourer Race there, but that day will come!"

Su Yu declared loudly, "In this Upper Realm, the Iron Devourer Race will witness our glory! We will slay our enemies and avenge the fallen elites of the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

"For every one of my followers slain, I shall repay a hundredfold!"

"Everyone, we will fight the Control King's lineage to the death, leaving none alive. Once they are vanquished, we will descend to the Lower Realm!"

"To the death!"

The roars echoed through the heavens! The Iron Devourers, though they might not participate in the battle, felt their blood boiling with excitement. Su Yu was not one to make empty threats; he had come to the Upper Realm for vengeance. Today, he had already severely injured two Heavenly Sovereigns of the Control King's lineage. He was truly ruthless!

At this moment, Su Yu's gaze turned towards the depths of Chaos Mountain, his voice booming across the land, "The Control King's lineage has betrayed the Human Race, colluding with chaos, an unforgivable crime! The Human Emperor did not punish them, nor did the Nine Generations of Human Lords. I shall punish them!"

"Such treachery deserves death! I strip the Control King of his title as a Human King, declaring him a traitor to the Human Race! I strip the Control King's lineage of their Human Race fortune. Let the Human Emperor and the heavens bear witness!"

"Traitors shall be executed!"

Boom!

At that moment, Su Yu's words became law, and the world changed color. In the distant east, in the Land of Dao Source, the Human Emperor's Great Dao trembled. Deep within chaos, Su Yu's Human Lord Seal also quivered. In the name of the current Human Lord, he judged the Control King guilty, stripping him of his Human Race fortune!

...

In the depths of chaos, within the Control King's lineage, mountains crumbled and the earth shook. The sky darkened as clouds obscured the sun. In the void, a giant resembling Su Yu appeared, opening its mouth to swallow the kingdom within the mountains. The ancestor of the Control King's lineage's face changed, suddenly throwing a punch!

Boom!

The heavens exploded, but the punch failed to reach the phantom. This giant, resembling Su Yu, appeared abruptly, swallowing without harming anyone. Yet, at that moment, some top experts felt a sense of dread, as if something was missing. The fortune of the entire Control King's lineage suddenly plummeted.

The statue of the Control King, enshrined in the grand hall, suddenly cracked and fell from its pedestal! However, it quickly reassembled and returned to its place, though something seemed to be missing.

"Guilty!" At that moment, the giant in the void let out a low roar, and a massive "Guilty" character branded the entire Control King Kingdom! Countless citizens looked up at the sky, filled with fear, suddenly feeling guilty!

...

At this moment, Su Yu's body erupted with the power of fortune, rumbling as if resisting something. His face turned pale, yet he laughed uncontrollably, "Control, I have declared you a traitor to the Human Race. Why resist? I am the Human Lord, the master of the Human Race! If I say you are a traitor, then you are! No matter how strong you are, you were merely one of the Four Extremes Human Kings in the past, your status no more than that. How can you contend with me?"

"Moreover... can you even return?"

"Hahaha!"

Su Yu laughed wildly, the power of fortune continuously erupting, suppressing the heavens. I may not control the myriad races, but can I not control you, the Human Race? The fortune of the Nine Generations of Humans, the ancient fortune, had been inherited by Su Yu, including the Heavenly Overseer Marquis he captured, and Hundred Battle's self-separation. It could be said that the entire ancient Human Race fortune was concentrated in Su Yu!

Since that's the case, I won't fight you physically; I'll declare you a traitor through fortune, and so you shall be! At this moment, in the eyes of everyone, in the eyes of the myriad races, the weak might not see anything, but the strong could clearly see a mass of dark clouds gathering in the depths of Chaos Mountain!

The fortune dissipated! The Control King's lineage didn't solely rely on Human Race fortune, and Su Yu couldn't destroy it all, but the fortune was clearly dissipating now.

...

Atop Ren Mountain, Destiny Marquis quickly opened his Heaven Eye! Not only him, but other strong individuals capable of opening their Heaven Eyes also activated various Dao techniques to look into the distance. What they saw left them all astonished.

Those who could see clearly, like Destiny Marquis, saw a golden dragon struggling above the Control King Kingdom, with Su Yu's phantom riding on it, extracting some of its fortune bit by bit.

Booming sounds echoed invisibly! The giant Su Yu, holding a great seal, suppressed the golden dragon, extracting nearly a third of its fortune in an instant, causing the dragon to shrink. The giant Su Yu then vanished, dissipating on the spot, and the golden dragon turned white, its golden hue fading!

Destiny Marquis was deeply shocked! Su Yu was not an emperor! The Control King's position wasn't conferred by Su Yu; Su Yu was merely a Human Lord, theoretically on par with the Control King. If the Human Emperor didn't remove the Control King's position, no one could, not even the Culture King.

Why was this happening? Why was it like this? Not only was Destiny Marquis shocked, but all the Heavenly Sovereigns atop Ren Mountain were also deeply shaken, looking towards Su Yu in the distance. Su Yu's aura was turbulent, seemingly heavily injured.

Both sides suffered! Yet, at this moment, Su Yu's wild laughter echoed again, "I declare you traitors, the so-called Control King's lineage shall vanish, leaving only the Sin Clan! Your clan, from now on, shall be the sin of the Human Race! Sin Clan suits you!"

At this moment, even the Saint Marquis of the Immortal Race couldn't help but exclaim, "This... he... he possesses more of the Human Lord's aura than any previous Human Lord, his status even slightly higher than the Control King's. How is this possible?"

Su Yu's ranking in the ancient royal court was unexpectedly slightly higher than the Control King's! Unbelievable! This matter, though seemingly unimportant, was actually quite significant. Stripping the Control King of his Human King status meant that the Control King's lineage no longer shared the power of the Human Race's fortune!

Hundred Battle had already separated his own Human Race fortune, and Su Yu had stripped the Control King's lineage. Now, the Human Race's fortune was shared only between Su Yu and the ancient Human Emperor.

The stripping of fortune, this was perhaps the first time it had happened! A descendant had stripped an ancestor of their Human King status, unbelievable!

In the distance, Tiangu was silent for a moment before slowly speaking, "Perhaps... because his identity and status are indeed very high! He inherited the Culture King's legacy, gained the support of the Radiant King and the Hundred Battle King's descendants, received the support of the Torchbearer lineage, and perhaps even the recognition of the Human Emperor..."

"The Human Emperor and among the Four Extremes Human Kings, the Culture King, Radiant King... perhaps even the Martial King's support, coupled with the Human Race's support for him, the Iron Devourer Race's support, he is indeed one of the Human Lords with the highest fortune and talent. I suspect he even captured the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, making his fortune even stronger. If the Heavenly Overseer was captured, it means his fortune is inferior to Su Yu's..."

At this moment, there was only admiration and sighs. Yet, someone was puzzled, "He seems injured, what is the purpose of such a grand display of stripping fortune?"

Not everyone understood the purpose of the power of fortune. At this moment, the Saint Marquis spoke softly, "Purpose? The purpose is that the Control King's lineage's fortune will decline. In the event of a great battle, if their strong individuals are defeated, they originally had hope of escaping or surviving severe injuries, but now... they will die!"

"Fortune is not omnipotent; it can only provide some auxiliary effects. If you are strong, the stripping of fortune actually has little impact!"

In the Kingdom of Control.

The Control King Ancestor, in a fit of rage, punched the sky. Unfortunately, this punch inadvertently involved Yue Hao, who had just barely begun to recover his physical form. With a sickening crunch, his newly reformed body was instantly shredded. His sea of will hurriedly fled, his face ashen as he glanced at the ancestor. The ancestor's expression also shifted, teeth clenched in disbelief. "Impossible! How can this be? Even if truly stripped, our clan possesses immense fortune. Besides the Human Clan's fortune, our clan inherently wields a formidable power of fortune! The strong are the source of fortune themselves. Why is this happening?"

Bad luck shouldn't be this severe!

The Control King's lineage inherently possessed a powerful force of fortune. The strong were essentially components of fortune. Now, it was merely said that the fortune granted by the Human Clan had dissipated somewhat. It didn't mean the Control King's lineage was devoid of fortune. If that were true, people would be dying left and right, tripping over their own feet!

This couldn't be!

He hadn't even aimed his attack at Yue Hao, yet Yue Hao was drawn into it.

At this moment, the other Heavenly Sovereigns also changed their expressions, their faces turning grim.

How could this be happening?

The Human Lord could actually strip the Control King of his fortune? What a joke! And not just any Human King, but one of the Four Extremes Human Kings.

They spoke of the Human Clan as insignificant, claiming to have become a Sacred Clan. However, the Control King's high status wasn't solely due to strength but also his position in the ancient royal court as one of the Four Extremes Human Kings, one of the five highest-ranking individuals in ancient times!

Today, after the disappearance of the ancient era, a junior had stripped him of his title!

The Control King... yes, this position of one of the Four Extremes Human Kings was truly stripped away by Su Yu!

An unbelievable outcome!

He wasn't the Human Emperor. Even in ancient times, only the Human Emperor could strip the Control King of his position, not even the Culture King could do it!

...

At the same time.

In the River of Time, upstream.

Xingyue had just arrived, or rather, it had happened almost immediately.

Yet at this moment, the River of Time ceased to tremble. Instead, a mysterious force of will swept through, causing all Human Clan experts to pause slightly.

At this moment, it was as if a voice whispered in their ears, "The Control King's lineage, treacherous and rebellious. The Human Emperor did not punish, nor did the Nine Generations of Human Lords. I shall punish! Strip the Control King of his title..."

The voice echoed in the hearts of all Human Clan experts.

A group of people, their expressions shifting.

Someone... was going to strip the Control King of his title!

My heavens, who could it be?

The Nine Generations of Human Lords... clearly not them. Could it be... could it be the Tenth Generation Human Lord Xingyue mentioned?

So domineering?

The Control King was one of the Four Kings of ancient times!

And at this moment, the Human Emperor's shadow trembled slightly, suddenly looking into the distance, downstream, murmuring after a long while, "So be it!"

Boom!

A surge of fortune erupted.

In the next moment, four massive golden light points appeared near the Human Emperor, along with thirty-six smaller golden light points and 360 white light points.

The Four Extremes Human Kings, thirty-six ordinary Human Kings, and 360 Human Marquis!

This was the peak combat strength of the Human Clan in those days!

At this moment, one of the massive golden light points suddenly shattered. The original four points became three, forming a triangle around the Human Emperor. Soon, these light points dissipated.

The Radiant King stepped forward, his tone complex. "Your Majesty!"

The Human Emperor sighed, "They were all my brothers and sisters who fought the Myriad Realms with me. I never wanted to abandon any of them... I never thought of stripping anyone of their title, let alone expelling them from the Human Clan! Even if they betrayed us, they are still part of the Human Clan! But now, the Tenth Generation Human Lord thinks otherwise, and... the fortune surges, the people's hearts align, the fortune is like a rainbow... Do you want me to refuse?"

He could refuse!

He was the one who conferred the titles!

At this moment, Su Yu's status was still not as high as his. Even if the fortune spread, if the Human Emperor did not permit it, Su Yu could only suggest it like a minister. But once the Human Emperor permitted it, everything became logical!

Su Yu, acting on behalf of the heavens, wielded the authority of the Human Emperor, naturally able to revoke the Control King's title.

"Su Yu?"

At this moment, the Radiant King murmured softly.

This time, he remembered the name.

Previously, Xingyue had mentioned it, but no one paid much attention. A Sunmoon Realm opener, now possibly crippled.

However, at this moment, this opener, the Tenth Generation Human Lord, had actually stripped the Control King of his title. In this instant, everyone remembered him.

The Control King was their comrade.

Of course, a comrade who had betrayed them.

But still, a comrade. The feelings were complex. Normally, no one mentioned stripping the Control King of his title, but now someone had done it.

In this instant, everyone fell silent.

And Xingyue, looking around, said nonchalantly, "It must be someone from the Control King's lineage causing trouble again! This lineage is notorious for their evil deeds! They colluded with the West Heavenly King, attempted to kill the Guardian of Hongmeng, and slaughtered thirty-six guardians, trying to lead the undead into the Realm of Living Beings!"

"In the Upper Realm, this lineage colluded with Hundred Battle, plotted against the Torchbearer lineage, and killed everyone in Bingku and Danyu. Even the old generals of Minshan have gradually fallen in battle..."

"When Su Yu reaches the Upper Realm, only a few old generals will be left alive, like Dingjun, Huoyun, and Yingwu. Oh, and there's also Zhou Tian..."

Upon hearing this, everyone felt a pang of sadness.

They hadn't even discussed this matter yet!

The Radiant King's heart trembled slightly. "Just... these few?"

"Yes, there are a few others, but they've all been turned by Hundred Battle. Now, only these few remain!"

In an instant, the group was devastated.

When the ancient war broke out, they left behind at least a hundred ancient marquises and numerous titled generals, untitled generals. Now... are they all gone?

It's a tragedy!

At this moment, someone in the crowd was surprised. "Dingjun... is still alive?"

Everyone looked at a middle-aged man. The man, seeing everyone looking at him, felt a bit awkward. "I mean... Dingjun... is a bit weak, and everyone else is dead?"

Oh my!

Dingjun is still alive!

Everyone knew this man, King Ping, a king with a physical body. Dingjun was under his command.

Strength... well, indeed a bit weaker among the ancient marquises.

Dingjun is alive... there's nothing more to say.

Nothing to say!

The Human Emperor's shadow, which had been somewhat sorrowful, now felt like laughing. "Isn't it a good thing that your marquis is alive?"

"......"

King Ping was embarrassed. It was a good thing, but... I didn't expect it!

Dingjun is still alive!

The Radiant King also laughed. "It's also good that Yingwu is still alive. She was just a titled general back then. To survive until now, her luck is indeed extraordinary!"

As for Marquis Huoyun, King Yue had already fallen in battle, so no one said much. Huoyun's strength wasn't weak to begin with.

"Sigh, let's not talk about this anymore. Stripping the title is stripping the title!"

The Human Emperor said no more.

Xingyue's words left everyone feeling uneasy.

The Control King's lineage, in those days, before they left, didn't appear to have any issues. Even if the Control King betrayed them, it was a matter between old comrades, not for outsiders to meddle in.

But when Xingyue said this lineage was notorious for their evil deeds, causing countless deaths and threatening the extinction of the Human Clan, everyone had nothing more to say.

Xingyue, without showing any emotion, seeing everyone quiet down, said no more.

How simple!

Use your brain!

When in doubt, use your brain. This brain... refers to thinking about what Su Yu would say.

If it were Su Yu, he would definitely spread rumors.

Fortunately, I'm not as shameless as Su Yu. I didn't spread rumors; I just told the truth, without any falsehoods.

Someone sighed, "Even if the Control King betrayed us, it was a matter between us. He wouldn't harm ordinary people... but his subordinates lost all sense of propriety, becoming so vicious! Stripping the title is a good thing!"

"Yes, even if he was dissatisfied with the Culture King, he shouldn't have implicated others. What did the others do wrong?"

"He deserves to die!"

"......"

A group of people, some angry, some helpless.

At this moment, the Human Emperor said no more.

He was just puzzled. Where did this Tenth Generation Human Lord, Su Yu, get such powerful fortune?

Strange!

Wasn't he crippled?

He glanced at Xingyue with suspicion, transmitting his voice, "This Su Yu, is he the Tenth Generation Human Lord, the one who saved you?"

"Yes."

"Is he strong?"

"Not strong."

"Oh!"

Not strong!

Then... could it really be the people's will, causing the fortune to surge? Thinking of this, he asked again, "Does he love the people like his own children?"

Xingyue thought for a moment. Is he?

Didn't feel like it!

But... since her brother asked, she replied, "Probably."

"Does he have a sense of responsibility towards the Human Clan?"

"He does!"

Xingyue nodded. Yes, Su Yu was good to his family and friends, and he was quite responsible towards his subordinates!

"Then... has he been to Tianhekou?"

"Probably?"

Xingyue remembered someone mentioning it. He probably had been there.

"The Xingyu Imprint, you gave it to him earlier?"

"Yes."

"He's the Human Lord, has the Xingyu Imprint, and has a sense of responsibility towards the Human Clan..."

At this moment, the Human Emperor seemed to understand something, murmuring, "This brat abandoned my Great Dao to open his own little path. Is the path he opened stronger than my Great Dao?"

He was filled with anger!

Who does he think he is?

My Great Dao is immensely powerful. Even if you open a small section, it's not something your Sunmoon Realm opening can compare to!

But soon, he understood, murmuring, "Could it be... he abandoned it just to open the Life and Death Dao to save you?"

At this moment, he was shocked, looking at Xingyue. "Sister, is this Su Yu... very close to you?"

Xingyue thought for a moment. Probably?

She nodded slightly, probably.

The Human Emperor's expression changed!

A peerless genius, the Human Lord, bore a responsibility heavier than Mount Tai. Yet, he was captivated by his sister, who was in a state of death, and astonishingly... he relinquished his kingdom for her. What was this? Choosing beauty over the throne? Abandoning his own Great Dao, the Human Emperor was at a loss for words, wanting to curse. But when Su Yu opened the heavens just to resurrect Xingyue, he suddenly felt conflicted. Someone who could inherit his Great Dao was truly a talent of heaven and earth! Just as outstanding as himself! He wasn't sure whether to lament the loss. It was indeed a pity! Such a remarkable individual, yet he chose to forsake the responsibility of inheriting the Great Dao. For a moment, the Human Emperor was filled with complex emotions. 

And then there was his sister... sigh! He didn't know whether to call her a femme fatale. If she weren't his sister... truly a shame!

"Su Yu... the tenth generation Human Lord!" the Human Emperor murmured, unsure of what to say.

...

At the same time, beyond the Heaven Gate, the Martial King and Culture King, who were once again fleeing, suddenly paused.

The Martial King exclaimed in surprise, "Hey, did you feel that?"

Nonsense! The man in white ignored him.

The burly man was shocked, "Someone stripped the Control King of his title, right?"

Yes, but I don't want to talk to you.

"Who did it? It doesn't seem like the boss. So fierce, why?"

Still don't want to talk to you!

"Old Wen, are you mute?"

The man in white continued to flee, and after a while, he sighed and said, "Not sure, don't want to guess. It's meaningless now! As for who... you've probably met him."

"I've met him?"

The Martial King was taken aback, and the next moment, his mouth fell open, "That guy from last time?"

"Probably!"

"Your son did it?"

"Your father did it!"

The man in white was annoyed. That was your father, not my son. This guy, how many times do I have to tell you? Enough already!

The Martial King pouted, then quickly laughed, "Forget it, doesn't matter... By the way, when can we rescue Wenyu?"

"Don't know!"

The man in white fell silent after speaking.

Seeing this, the Martial King had to shut up. But soon, he couldn't help but ask, "Will Wenyu die soon?"

"......"

The man in white wanted to kill him for being a jinx!

"But I will save her!"

The Martial King said seriously, this was his brother's sister! After saying that, he added seriously, "Once she's saved, I'll be her brother-in-law. Although Wenyu is a bit ugly, not to my taste!"

The man in white's eyes flashed like lightning!

The Martial King chuckled awkwardly, "Just trying to motivate myself, otherwise I'm afraid I won't have the drive!"

"Shut up!"

"Okay, I'll shut up... But seriously, once Wenyu is saved, Old Wen, let her eat more. She's so skinny, it's pitiful!"

The burly man sighed, look at how my sister has been starved! Heartache! Now she's in crisis again, who knows how skinny she'll get, truly pitiful, heartache. I said I'd be your brother-in-law just to comfort you, did you take it seriously? I wouldn't do that!

The man in white couldn't be bothered with him, continuing forward, fleeing through the air, transmitting his voice, "Don't worry about the outside world!"

"I'm not worrying!"

Forget it, the Culture King didn't want to say anything. He probably wasn't worrying, just sensed something and said a few words.

...

At this moment, many Human Realm experts sensed something.

On Bamboo Mountain, Su Yu's face was pale, his fortune depleted, yet he laughed heartily.

Control King? No more!

From now on, just Control!

Whether the Control King was dead or behind the Gate of Hell, he was powerless. What could he do?

As the Human Lord, I strip you of your title!

It might not affect the Control King much, but it had a huge impact on his lineage. I let your fortune dissipate, bring you misfortune!

Beside him, the Giant Axe was stunned, "Your Majesty... you... weren't just shouting, were you?"

Could he really strip it away?

Su Yu glanced at him, smiling faintly, "Giant Axe Marquis, want me to try it on you?"

"......"

No! I don't want that! If it's true, won't I lose my marquis title?

Su Yu chuckled, "Stripping a title isn't that hard! As long as the Human Emperor has no objections, it's nothing! Of course, for Control, losing the title doesn't affect his strength, so it's nothing! But for these criminals, it has an impact, not too big, but... any lucky escapes, near-death survivals, might not exist anymore!"

Su Yu smiled faintly, "That's what I want, to crush their hopes! When the war starts, either they kill all the enemies, or... there's no retreat! Because once they retreat, it might be a rout, panic, and no place to bury their dead! I'm giving them pressure, giving them motivation, it's a good thing, they should thank me!"

March nodded, somewhat solemn, and quickly said, "Your Majesty, you were also affected, right?"

Su Yu nodded, "No matter! Just consumed some fortune power, nothing much!"

Indeed, nothing much! Fortune, as long as I'm strong, will naturally continue to grow. Now, it's also a time when Su Yu's fortune is soaring. Moreover, in the newly born world, fortune power is also being generated. Su Yu is accumulating his fortune power, the path of fortune.

On the first day in the Upper Realm, Su Yu did two major things. Or three! He defeated Yuehao and his group, brought back the Iron Devourer Race, and stripped the Control King of his title. As a result, the entire Control King's lineage probably hated Su Yu to death, wishing to kill him immediately!

And Su Yu, as if the chaos wasn't enough, his voice once again shook the heavens, "Sinful race, if you want to summon that master of laws, hurry up, hahaha, otherwise, I will definitely stop you! It's best to burn a few Heavenly Sovereigns to summon, it can be faster, the myriad races are foolish, always hesitating, foolish to the point of ignorance, trying to hide from me, Su Yu, too difficult! Offend me, your death won't be far!"

In the distance, silence reigned!

...

On Ren Mountain, a group of strong individuals looked at each other for a long time. The Saint Marquis said in a deep voice, "Are they really trying to summon that master of laws?"

If so, don't wait for Su Yu to come to negotiate cooperation! That would be too late!

Soon, the Saint Marquis said in a deep voice, "Let's take the initiative to find Su Yu. His subordinate Tongtian swallowed that portal, maybe he really knows something. If we cooperate... it's best to cooperate!"

Previously, they said to wait for Su Yu to come to negotiate cooperation, but now forget it, take the initiative to find Su Yu!

This madman, Su Yu, doesn't seem to have any intention of cooperation. Or rather, he's waiting for them to take the initiative to negotiate!

This guy, his methods are really not weak, coming in and trying to seize the initiative.

As for the previous talk of Su Yu coming to negotiate cooperation in three or five days, it's all a joke. He's probably not coming!

At this moment, the Coronal Heavenly Sovereign also said in a deep voice, "Let's talk to Su Yu! We can't let them really summon the master of laws, otherwise, even if we can match them, how many Heavenly Sovereigns would have to die?"

This time, the myriad races were quite efficient, quickly reaching a consensus. They decided to take the initiative to talk to Su Yu!

Su Yu's side wasn't weak in combat power, the key was that Su Yu's side was very crazy. If they really cooperated, dealing with the Control King's lineage would be much simpler.

And the former queen's delaying tactics... instantly became unfeasible!

They had to attack the Control King's lineage as soon as possible!

The former queen sighed, saying nothing, but was helpless. She wanted to delay, but it was clearly unfeasible. She guessed this might also be one of Su Yu's strategies.

This guy, Su Yu, the more you look, the more sinister he seems. He seemed to predict that everyone might want to delay, so he launched a battle, making delay unfeasible. Instantly, everyone had to follow his lead.

The myriad races, the Control King's lineage, all had to prepare for a great war!

In the crowd, Tiangu was also thoughtful. After a long time, he said, "Cooperating with him is actually a good thing. Cooperating with him might create greater results, kill more strong enemies, and suffer fewer losses... The only thing to worry about is not to be tricked by him!"

Cooperating with Su Yu, if allied, is actually quite enjoyable! This guy has many methods, sharp intelligence, seems to know everything, instantly grasping some crucial intelligence. This is something the myriad races haven't built up.

Sometimes, Tiangu felt helpless. The myriad races also built many intelligence systems, but the intelligence still didn't come as fast as Su Yu's. This has to be said, it's a very frustrating thing.

Just talking about summoning the master of laws, the myriad races knew nothing. As soon as Su Yu entered the Upper Realm, he knew!

In such a comparison, the strong of the myriad races seem very useless.

Tiangu sighed, the initiative was once again in Su Yu's hands!
