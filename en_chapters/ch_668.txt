Chapter 668: The Five Elements Submit

Killed dozens of Death Hou!

Was it true?

Or false?

Countless thoughts surfaced in Topsoil Spirit’s mind.

If it was false, then Su Yu was just bragging, and there was nothing more to say.

If it was true… first, Su Yu’s side already possessed earth-shattering power.

Second, the Myriad Realms were unaware, but their race knew first. This was… a crisis!

At this moment, sweat dripped down. Topsoil Spirit instantly understood: this was a crisis. If what Su Yu said was true, he had effortlessly revealed a great secret unknown to the myriad races. If the Five Elemental Race did not submit, what would be their fate?

Extermination?

Topsoil Spirit’s heart churned with agitation, unease, and urgency. He looked up at Su Yu, who was lazily leaning back in his chair. Topsoil Spirit glanced at him, then said in a deep voice, “Emperor Yu, the Five Elemental Race and the Human Race were considered staunch allies in ancient times…”

Su Yu yawned. “That has nothing to do with me. I am not an ancient emperor! I don’t ask about the past, nor do I look to the future; I only speak of the present! Brother Topsoil, you are a smart man! Among the entire Five Elemental Race, only you catch my eye. As for these Eternals… to say something you won’t like, I intend to use them as chess pieces!
