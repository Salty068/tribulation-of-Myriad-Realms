Chapter 758: Friends of the Great Dao

Upper Realm.

The Giant Axe was the first to make a move. A Heavenly Sovereign without any attachments, no human burdens, and no protective duties—such a solitary powerhouse was the most feared by all sides.

...

Lower Realm.

Su Yu, accompanied by Wan Tiansheng and Lantian, went to find the researchers. In terms of research, the multi-divine character faction was quite adept. Because the multi-divine character faction had many divine characters, it was originally prepared for the pen dao, which was considered one of the more difficult paths within the Great Dao. The talents of the multi-divine character faction were not weak, and their understanding of the Great Dao was quite decent. However, there were not many strong individuals in the current multi-divine character faction.

...

Death Realm.

In the Spirit Suppression Domain, within Hetu's territory, which was the area suppressed by Old Turtle, Bai Feng and others were present. Before Su Yu went to the Upper Realm last time, he had arranged for them to be in the ancient city. Before Hongmeng went to the Abyssal Realm, he had arranged for them to be in the Death Realm below.

Bai Feng, Wu Lan, and the others were relatively weak, and their vitality was not strong, so there was no worry about triggering changes in the Celestial River of Death. With Old Turtle's protective power, they could also avoid being eroded by death energy.

Primordial Spirit Research Institute.

This was perhaps the umpteenth research institute they had established, always relocating quickly and changing research projects swiftly.

Inside the institute, Hetu was present, along with a few unfamiliar undead. These were all students of the Culture King from years past. Some had only recently revived, while others had revived earlier but had wandered elsewhere, with little memory restored. As Hetu and the others searched, they provided enough undead imprints to restore some memories.

There were not many, only four. The Culture King's students back then were far more numerous; just looking at the divine character combat techniques in the Culture Tomb, there were hundreds who practiced them. Yet now, only four had been found, all of whom were quite powerful. The weaker ones might not have revived, or perhaps were never guided back.

When Su Yu and his group arrived, the people inside were discussing something in the research room. As Su Yu entered, everyone turned to look at him. Except for Hetu, who approached, the others ignored them.

Hetu approached, and Su Yu raised his hand slightly, not exchanging pleasantries, but instead listening to the argument between the undead and Bai Feng.

"Bai Feng, you're too young. You haven't even comprehended the Great Dao. Do you know what it means to integrate with the Great Dao?"

"You're too naive. The path of space encompasses everything, but it's not the only one... You want to use the path of space as the core to encompass all paths, but that's not feasible!"

"…"

Several undead were scolding Bai Feng, this junior. The multi-divine character faction could be considered a legacy of the Culture King, and by that calculation, Bai Feng was their descendant of unknown generations. The undead had recovered much of their memory, and though they were dead, they still showed no respect to Bai Feng. A child, what does he know? He hadn't even touched the Great Dao and dared to speak nonsense!

Bai Feng, his face flushed, retorted angrily, "You're the ones who are outdated! Does research have to involve personally touching every path? Yes, it's a bit idealistic, but I'm proposing some theoretical analysis. I've also outlined many divine characters. Theory is theory, practice is practice!"

"In my view, the space path encompasses many things. Is it related to speed? Of course! Space traversal definitely involves speed. Space includes teleportation, compression, fast and slow, cutting... all sorts of Great Dao are related to the space path! The place we live in is a form of space, and the manifestation of the Great Dao is all within space!"

"Including the River of Time, it is also within a space!"

"Whether it's the cosmos, time and space, living beings, or undead, which of these isn't within space?"

"Even the intangible willpower, the power of the Great Dao, the power of laws, which of these isn't within space?"

Bai Feng's face was red, and he shouted, "You say, can the space path become this core point for extension? If you have the ability, propose a core point for the extension of all paths! I'm just proposing a theory. Whether it can be implemented still requires Su Yu and Lantian, who are gathering the myriad paths, to experiment..."

Outside the door, Su Yu listened silently. His teacher, indeed, wasn't very strong, having just entered the Shanhai Realm not long ago. Shanhai... now seemed so distant. Yet, listening to Bai Feng's words, Su Yu suddenly felt there was some truth to it. Theoretically, the space path indeed encompassed everything. What about using the space path as the core Great Dao? Using it as a base point, perhaps it could truly form a closed loop.

As Su Yu pondered, one of the undead, possibly female, spoke with disdain, "What you're saying is nonsense! The space path encompasses everything, but that doesn't mean it can be the core point of a closed loop. You want to use this path as the core and just throw everything in, right? If it were that simple, any strong practitioner of the space path could integrate all paths!"

"This is unrealistic! The space path is just one of the myriad paths. It can be one of the core points of a closed loop, but it cannot be the only core! Integrating myriad paths still requires trying to connect each path one by one... You're trying to take a shortcut, and shortcuts don't work!"

They were dissatisfied with Bai Feng. Bai Feng's idea was to use the space path as the main path and throw all paths into one pot, making a big stew. A pot of chaos! Does it make sense? It might fool outsiders, or even those who aren't quite outsiders, like Su Yu, who thought it made sense. But at this moment, the female undead was extremely disdainful. This was an irresponsible speculation and theory. She quickly said, "This is not a joke. If the integration is wrong, the Great Dao will collapse. One path collapsing might lead to all paths collapsing!"

"This is like the 360 acupoints forming a complete closed circle, but they need to be connected correctly... And you? You just connect all 360 acupoints together... Can this form a cultivation technique, a complete cycle technique? Impossible! Try it, and if it doesn't blow up your acupoints, it would be strange!"

"Young people always want to take shortcuts. They discover a little insignificant thing and think they've grasped the Great Dao, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth..."

"…"

The argument was intense. Beside Su Yu, Hetu transmitted his voice, "Emperor Yu, they've been arguing for days. From the beginning, there has been a conceptual disagreement!"

"Bai Feng wants simplification. Integrating the myriad paths slowly takes too long and is too difficult! According to Li Yun's friend, Bai Feng is swallowing it whole. His single path core is too crude. Weaving the myriad paths is like weaving a net of myriad paths. One mistake, and it won't work. It must be woven path by path..."

Su Yu listened silently. He understood Bai Feng's thoughts. Didn't Bai Feng know that weaving the myriad paths bit by bit was better? He knew! But Bai Feng also understood his student's situation. Su Yu needed speed. Weaving the myriad paths bit by bit was too slow. So, Bai Feng's idea was to first lay a foundation, then slowly sort it out. As long as the myriad paths could be roughly integrated, it would be fine. How long would it take to weave and integrate the myriad paths bit by bit? No one was sure!

Su Yu thought to himself and stepped in.

"Get out!"

An undead suddenly shouted. Hetu's face turned stern, "Fool, this is His Majesty Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu waved his hand, and inside, several undead all looked at Su Yu. Previously, they hadn't seen Su Yu. Last time, Su Yu had only given some instructions through Hetu. The undead looked at each other, unsure of what to do.

Su Yu didn't dwell on it and directly said, "Seniors, I am Su Yu, a student of Teacher Bai Feng. Let me ask first, if the myriad paths are slowly integrated, purely theoretically, how long would it take to form a closed loop?"

The undead exchanged glances. Seeing Su Yu go straight to the point, they didn't dwell on other matters. The female undead quickly said, "Currently, within the chaotic path, there is a mixture of a large number of Great Dao powers. We haven't analyzed exactly how many, but it's said to be myriad paths... No one knows if it's truly myriad paths. Based on current findings, it's probably no less than 3,000 Great Daos!"

The female undead continued, "3,000 Great Daos don't need to be tried one by one. Some obviously unrelated Great Daos don't need to be tried. The integration of Great Daos also has logic... Back then, we split the pen dao into 99 types of Great Dao powers, which was also a form of Great Dao integration. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

She worried that Su Yu wouldn't understand.

But Su Yu nodded, "I understand. Any cultivation technique or Great Dao has special rules, such as the symmetry of acupoints, the uniqueness of connecting acupoints... So, according to the senior's words, how long would it take to complete the integration?"

"One Great Dao, to integrate, takes about three days!"

"Calculating 3,000 Great Daos, even without rest, it would take at least 9,000 days, roughly 30 years!"

The female undead smiled, "This is based on you being able to provide some Great Dao powers, the foundation of various Great Dao powers! And earlier, I received some information, which is a composition ratio of some chaotic Great Daos, the components of various Great Daos... This information is very helpful to us. Otherwise, forget 30 years, even 300 years or 3,000 years would be difficult! Being able to analyze a large number of component ratios, that is a strong person, a genius..."

She looked at Su Yu and the others, "Can you introduce us to this researcher who analyzed the Great Dao ratios? We would like to communicate with them personally..."

At least 30 years! This was the time given by these undead after Su Yu and the others analyzed the chaotic path earlier.

Su Yu frowned slightly and quickly said, "That's too slow! Back then, the analysis of the Chaos Path was done by me, Lantian, and Director Wan together. We all follow the path of merging myriad Daos, so we could analyze some ratios..."

He looked at the group, "Seniors, I understand that you strive for perfection in your research, but... I don't have much time!"

"I'm preparing to open the path, the path of merging myriad Daos!"

"I need to complete it as soon as possible, maybe... only half a month."

"......"

The few death spirits were stunned.

How long?

Half a month?

What a joke!

Even Bai Feng was shocked at this moment, "Stop joking. Even my 'One Pot Stew' can't be done in half a month. It requires the Daos not to repel each other and needs to be tried one by one. Even if it doesn't take 30 years, it would still take three to five years at least. Are you kidding?"

Half a month?

Get lost!

Impossible.

The few death spirits were also a bit annoyed at this time, "That's impossible! Half a month... to merge all Daos? How could that be, even if Culture King were here, he couldn't achieve that!"

Su Yu nodded, "I know, I'm not completely ignorant."

Su Yu explained, "It's like this, I will delve into the River of Time. The power of the River of Time and the power of Chaos, one is the myriad Daos after sorting, the other is before sorting. I will make some comparisons, match them, and make a record. Currently, the idea is to first refer to the power of the River of Time for matching..."

"That won't work either!"

The female death spirit shook her head, "It's not enough to just see the Daos. Let me ask you, have you mastered the myriad Daos?"

"No!"

Su Yu shook his head, "I have a shallow understanding of over a hundred Daos. To say I've mastered the myriad Daos... I've only dabbled a bit, and I don't have the energy or time to delve deeply... Of course, I've sketched thousands of virtual Daos, just doing some basic comprehension..."

In fact, it was the pages of the Mark of Civilization that had stolen some power.

Su Yu had a simple and shallow understanding of these Daos, without delving deeply.

Even so, the few death spirits were slightly shaken. The female death spirit hesitated, "Are you the one who inherited the pen dao?"

Su Yu nodded, "Yes, I was the one who merged the pen dao before!"

"No wonder! Then you are indeed a peerless genius. The pen dao was split into a hundred powers by us, and you can inherit the pen dao, which means you have at least understood and comprehended a hundred Daos, sketched them into divine characters, and thus formed the pen dao..."

Now, the few death spirits no longer regarded Su Yu as an outsider.

Being able to merge the pen dao and sketch a hundred divine characters meant Su Yu had mastered at least a hundred powers.

Quite monstrous!

The female death spirit was no longer so aggressive, and she said solemnly, "Half a month is too short. Why the rush?"

Su Yu explained, "The current situation is ever-changing. In the Upper Realm, Culture King's great enemy, the Control King's lineage, is rising! Not to mention the threat of the myriad races, down here, the Million Kings are about to return... Hundred Battle King... might not align with our Dao lineage! He has occupied the physical Dao, perhaps related to the Human Ancestor!"

"The struggle for the myriad realms is becoming more severe, no longer just a simple unification struggle, but a struggle of Daos!"

Yes, a struggle of Daos!

At this moment, Su Yu also spoke this term, even though he hadn't heard Culture King's words, he still uttered the term struggle of Daos.

Su Yu said solemnly, "Although I haven't inherited the entire Dao lineage of the ancient Human Emperor and Culture King, my Dao lineage is fundamentally derived from them! Let's put it this way, the Control King's lineage might now represent the Dao lineage of the Chaos Era, Hundred Battle might represent the Dao lineage of the Primordial Era, and I... am likely the Dao lineage of the Ancient Era!"

"But my strength is too weak, my side is too weak!"

"If I don't open the path now and wait for 30 years... that's impossible. By then, I might be wiped out!"

Some things he hadn't said before, but now, he said them to the few death spirits.

In fact, he wasn't familiar with them, and precisely because he wasn't familiar, and these few were students of Culture King, Su Yu would say these things.

Su Yu himself was not independent.

He was indeed considered an inheritor of the Ancient Dao lineage!

Of course, the Great Zhou King and others, being at the foot of the mountain, might not have seen through, or rather, hadn't seen through the essence of Hundred Battle.

But Su Yu had a guess in his heart, Hundred Battle, also did not represent the Ancient Dao lineage, he was an inheritor of the Primordial Dao lineage.

Now, it could no longer be simply distinguished by human and myriad races.

But by different Dao lineages!

The Control King rebelled, the Control King's lineage blocked the emergence of Culture King's inheritors, all of this was probably due to representing different forces and eras, the Control King representing perhaps the Chaos Era!

This was inferred from what Marquis Tongtian said about the portal, and some of Su Yu's own speculations.

"Struggle of Daos!"

The faces of the few death spirits changed slightly, the female death spirit, with some surprise, said, "Struggle of Daos... this... little friend means... the Daos and Dao lineages of different eras are all appearing, wanting to restore the rule and order of different eras?"

Su Yu nodded, "It's possible! I speculate... just a speculation, Chaos, Creation, Primordial, Ancient, multiple eras are beginning to converge, and next, the myriad realms will definitely be in chaos!"

Saying this, Su Yu added in a low voice, "The geniuses and strong of each era may all gather!"

As soon as these words came out, even Wan Tiansheng and Lantian changed color.

What does that mean?

But Su Yu didn't care about them, continuing, "Those who disappeared, went missing, fell... the strong of each period may all emerge from somewhere, from seals, this era... may converge!"

He didn't know if his speculation was true.

However, the door... the door sealing the era appeared!

The Human Emperor is about to return, Culture King and others might also return, everything, everything might appear.

Therefore, Su Yu must open the path as soon as possible!

He couldn't wait any longer!

This point, now, perhaps only he could understand.

Perhaps, Hundred Battle or the Chaos Race also had people who understood, whether the myriad races knew, that was uncertain.

The female death spirit, although not understanding much, generally understood Su Yu's meaning, urgent, very urgent!

However, no matter how urgent, merging myriad Daos was not a simple matter.

She frowned deeply, and the other three death spirits beside her were also worried.

Difficult!

Too difficult, the time Su Yu gave was too short.

Su Yu said again, "Next, I, Lantian, and Director Wan Tiansheng, the three of us will cooperate with everyone!"

"I know it's very difficult, I have an idea, everyone listen to my opinion..."

Everyone looked at him, and Su Yu said solemnly, "It's like this, cultivating a path can be done step by step, just like when I opened acupoints, I can open one first, then the second, it's not necessary to open 720 acupoints at once!"

"I am thinking, what path to start with, like my teacher said, the space path, I start with the space path, open the path while perfecting it, open one path, merge one path, and finally form a closed loop, completing the cultivation and opening of the entire great Dao!"

As soon as these words came out, even Bai Feng couldn't help but say, "This... is too dangerous, the margin for error is even lower than my proposed 'One Pot Stew'!"

Su Yu nodded, "Therefore, every time a path is opened, it requires everyone's precise calculation! After opening this path, what path to open next? After opening, the next path, we may need to consider the fusion of the entire closed-loop great Dao!"

"If there is an error in any of the paths, it may need to be scrapped and redone, it's a trial and error without calculation!"

Su Yu said calmly, "I am prepared for this, just to save the time of experimentation, starting directly from myself, I will directly become the experimenter!"

All risks, he would bear himself.

Perhaps after opening 2999 paths, suddenly discovering that the second path was wrong, shouldn't be ordered like this, scrapping the second path, perhaps the thousands of paths behind would be scrapped, all needing to start over.

At that time, it would be a huge trouble.

At this moment, even the few death spirits were shaken, doing it this way, the danger was extremely high, and it was very easy to go wrong.

Moreover, if it was discovered halfway that the previous path was constructed incorrectly, it would lead to Su Yu's path being completely wrong, needing to start over.

"Your name is Su Yu, right?"

At this moment, the female death spirit said solemnly, "If you choose this way, then you can skip many steps and proceed with the fusion of the great Dao! You can even start directly, in 15 days, we can use one path as a starting point to deduce the fusion of dozens or hundreds of paths for you, but we cannot guarantee it is correct, nor dare to guarantee it!"

"Although we have some understanding of the great Dao, it is too shallow."

"Moreover, this starting great Dao, what great Dao you choose, you also need to weigh yourself... any path as a starting point may be possible, but the starting path bears greater pressure, requiring a very strong understanding of the great Dao, perhaps also the core point of your great Dao..."

She was not exactly narrating.

Su Yu's requirements were too high, the time required was too urgent, she was a bit reluctant, "Give us another 30 years... no, we strive to deduce a complete closed-loop great Dao for you within 20 years! Conduct a trial and error, which can effectively avoid many troubles, won't torment people... 20 years, not too long, this is already beyond imagination, Su Yu, what do you think?"

She could strive to shorten the time for Su Yu, because as an inheritor of the pen dao, strictly speaking, Su Yu was considered a direct descendant of Culture King.

If the Dao was ruined, it would be too tormenting.

Even if not dead, it would be a huge trouble.

Su Yu smiled, "Do you think... how long can I live?"

The few death spirits suddenly looked at him, and the next moment, their expressions changed.

Su Yu... didn't have much lifespan left!

The death aura was about to overshadow the life aura!

The female death spirit couldn't help but say, "This... why not first cultivate the pen dao, strengthen the pen dao, strive to enter the realm of the ruler of laws within 20 years, in this way, you can extend your lifespan."

Su Yu shook his head. "Twenty years? That's too late! Even if I truly master the pen dao in twenty years, by then, it might be too late for everything! The pen dao is powerful, but at the convergence of eras, the pen dao... isn't enough to reverse anything!"

The few death spirits exchanged glances. This Su Yu had grand ambitions, or perhaps it was better to say he had lofty aspirations and a broad vision. He believed that even mastering the pen dao wouldn't allow him to participate in major events.

Opening the myriad daos...

At this moment, Bai Feng spoke up, "Let's proceed as Su Yu suggested! Using one dao as the foundation, we'll try to deduce the subsequent fusion daos, arrange them in order, and strive to sort out the sequence of hundreds or even thousands of daos within fifteen days."

"But Su Yu, you need to give us a starting point. Which dao should we begin with?"

He looked at Su Yu seriously and said, "The choice of the foundational dao might be trivial, or it might be crucial. Think it over."

Su Yu smiled. "Teacher mentioned opening the space dao before... The space dao is actually the yu dao, with the four directions as yu, yu being space! After some thought, regardless of anything else, I'll use yu as the foundation of the dao!"

He exhaled. "Cosmic civilization, yu as the beginning, zhou as the end! Civilization interspersed within, myriad dao civilization, myriad race civilization... Since I'm forging the Mark of Cosmic Civilization, I've long been prepared and had this idea! The four directions of heaven and earth as yu, it's the space dao, yet not entirely! I am named Yu... so let yu be the beginning!"

Upon hearing this, the others exchanged peculiar glances.

Su Yu didn't think too much about it. He decided directly!

Yu as the beginning!

Beside him, Lantian no longer wore a playful smile, instead adopting a serious demeanor. "Is the cosmos a closed loop of two points? The dao of yu is understandable, but what about the dao of zhou? Yu is space, zhou is time, and you and Tiansheng have both said before that time is singular... Are you planning to break this concept? If so, what you said before would become a joke!"

The dao of yu as the beginning, he had no objections. But the dao of zhou as the end, he saw a significant problem. This might lead to Su Yu ultimately being unable to close the myriad daos, unable to weave them into a single thread, leaving Su Yu's dao full of flaws, and possibly even collapsing entirely in the end.

The idea of myriad race civilization interspersed within, myriad dao civilization interspersed within, was indeed a good idea, with no issues.

Su Yu smiled. "Time is singular, and I've always affirmed this! However, I want to build my own myriad daos, my own heaven and earth. I belong to the pioneers, so the time of the beginning of heaven and earth is also in my hands! When I declare the beginning of heaven and earth, it is the beginning... When I let heaven and earth return to chaos, it returns to chaos... This is the dao of zhou!"

"Time, in my hands!"

The Mark of Civilization floated, and the four large characters of Cosmic Civilization appeared on the cover created by the map of the Great Dao.

At this moment, Su Yu was full of fighting spirit. "This is my dao, destined from the start! The Lord of Death Spirits opened the death spirit dao, the Human Emperor opened the dao of responsibility... But I won't. I want to open the dao of cosmic civilization!"

"Mixing in some of my own will, some inclinations, such a dao is too limited. For example, the death spirit dao is only suitable for death spirits, which is not my pursuit... Even if I fail, I want to discard some of my own ideas and purely open a pure dao of heaven and earth!"

"The Human Emperor's dao is the same, full of restrictions, responsibility... responsible for the human race. Such a dao is certainly not weak, but it bears too much!"

"So, as much as possible, let it be centered on me, not on others... Cosmic civilization, throughout!"

The next moment, the character "Yu" floated in the air.

Space trembled.

Yu as the four directions of heaven and earth, the four directions of heaven and earth is the space dao, yet... not entirely!

Su Yu's "Yu" character was actually a combination of several daos. At this moment, Su Yu continued, "Yu is heaven and earth, heaven and earth have life and death, have yin and yang, have the five elements, have qi, have earth, qi floats as heaven, qi sinks as earth... These are all the daos that need to be fused next!"

"All the foundations for constructing Yu must be counted, deduced well, how to fuse... Fifteen days is enough!"

Su Yu smiled. "I only look at the present, not the future. The future is unattainable. If I truly fail in the future, unable to close my dao... then let me be the failed pioneer!"

"In the future, leave behind a tale of 'Emperor Yu opened the dao and perished in the middle'... It seems like a good legend too!"

Everyone was heavy-hearted.

Wan Tiansheng took a deep breath. "Listen to Su Yu, use Yu as the foundation! Next, we'll experiment more, try various powers of the Great Dao. In this half month, Lantian, you and I will try various powers of the Great Dao! And several seniors... all are geniuses in research, this matter, I entrust to you all, the path of deduction is very troublesome, and we are not proficient."

The few nodded.

An elderly male death spirit spoke for the first time, his voice low. "It's best to use some virtual daos to try! But Su Yu's dao needs to be used for opening the dao, it can't be easily tried..."

He thought for a moment and said, "Is there any other way to get some virtual daos, to do some simple fusion trials, this way, it's safer!"

Virtual dao... pseudo dao... Qi Rong!

Su Yu's eyes moved slightly. Qi Rong was also an expert in researching the Great Dao, and Hongmeng had already said that Qi Rong and Fat Ball went to get some pseudo daos.

Should he bring Qi Rong in as well?

To conduct research together!

At this moment, having one more person meant one more strength.

Thinking of this, Su Yu nodded. "I'll go find someone immediately. Do you have any other needs?"

"Yes!"

The elderly death spirit quickly said, "We need divine characters, a large number of divine characters! Divine characters are also the embryonic form of the rules of the Great Dao, we need divine characters to conduct some experiments! Also, we need various powers of the Great Dao..."

Su Yu smiled. "I have that. The Mark of Civilization still has over a thousand pages buried in the Great Dao, although the power absorbed isn't much, it's enough for now!"

Beside him, Bai Feng said solemnly, "Don't you have a Book of Time? Just use it! I suggest using the Book of Time as a test subject, even if the Book of Time is stronger than your Mark of Civilization, the Mark of Civilization is your weapon of proving the dao, the Book of Time... is good for experimental use!"

"Book of Time?"

The few death spirits exchanged glances, seemingly having heard of it.

Su Yu was about to speak when Lantian laughed. "Why bother? I'll go get the Hunting Heaven List, and... don't forget, I am the path of all beings, use me for the experiment!"

He laughed, "Whatever dao, I know most of them! The myriad races' daos, I know most of them, even if I don't, I can learn them immediately, swallow them! The Hunting Heaven List is also a weapon of the path of all beings... No need to waste the Book of Time, if the Hunting Heaven List is ruined, it's ruined, after all, it's just a scrap crafted by the Culture King."

The others looked at Lantian again, did you know, this was crafted by our teacher!

Those words, really made one want to punch him!

And Su Yu, slightly frowning, said, "Your avatar already exploded, now you only have this one, if you cut your sea of will again, I'm afraid you'll cut yourself to death!"

Lantian laughed, "No worries, I'll walk my path of all beings again, absorbing the power of the Great Dao, it's actually very quick to recover!"

When treated as a national hero, I shall repay as a national hero!

Fusion dao, fusing with Lantian, is more convenient than anything.

Even if the avatar explodes again, his strength will surely be affected, even causing chaos, flaws in the Great Dao, so what?

This era is inherently crazy.

Even if I go mad, I still remember, I am Lantian!

That's enough!

Here, I have my dao friends, helping me open the dao.

"Dao friend Su wants to open the dao, should open a strong dao, that day dao friend helped me open the dao, I can naturally help dao friend open the dao!"

At this moment, Lantian was all smiles, "No need to say more, I'll go get the Hunting Heaven List... Liu Hong, that guy, should be out of seclusion by now! To hear the dao in the morning, and die in the evening! Dao friend, since you've clarified the Great Dao, you should go forward without hesitation!"

Lantian's smile grew brighter. "If you die, it's not a loss. We, these people, aren't we living for the pursuit of the dao? To see the dao we've opened, whether good or bad, is a success!"

"If dao friend truly falls, it will be enough to be remembered..."

Su Yu chuckled. "You crow's mouth!"

"This is called preparing for the worst!"

Lantian laughed. "If dao friend fails to prove the dao, it saves the trouble later, to fall at the peak, a good ending!"

At this moment, Su Yu laughed, and Lantian laughed too.

Beside them, Wan Tiansheng also smiled.

Across from them, Bai Feng sighed inwardly, my student... is really different from before.

The next moment, Bai Feng regained his composure and said, "You guys, stop saying these discouraging words! Su Yu, go prepare what we need now, immediately, we'll start locking the base point, matching the Great Dao, and try to minimize the risks!"

Su Yu nodded, said no more, and quickly disappeared.

He didn't even have time to ask what these people were called.

Of course, no one cared about that.

Researchers don't need to care about these things, as long as their ideas align.

And Lantian also quickly disappeared, he needed to find Liu Hong and retrieve the Hunting Heaven List.

Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment, then looked at Hetu. "Dao friend Hetu, I need some of your help."

Hetu was puzzled, and Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "Su Yu won't say it, so I'll say it directly! He uses the yu dao as the foundation, it must encompass life and death, the death dao is also one of the daos he needs to outline early on! He might, in the middle of opening the dao, comprehend the death dao, transform life into death, and step into the realm of death spirits! At that time, I hope dao friend can provide some insights from when you transformed life into death..."

Hetu's expression changed slightly.

Wan Tiansheng nodded. "Yes, I need dao friend to recover all memories, including the insights at the moment of life and death! I have such experiences too, but they're not pure enough. This time, whether Su Yu can successfully open the dao, the transformation between life and death is also a crucial part... He didn't say it, probably wanting to prepare himself, but I hope dao friend can provide some support."

In the fleeting moments between life and death, there exists a profound terror that Hetu might not wish to recall. Su Yu never mentioned it, but at this moment, Wan Tiansheng brought it up.

Hetu remained silent for a while before nodding. "Very well, I shall prepare myself in the coming days. At the moment of my death back then... I glimpsed into the abyss... I am reluctant to remember it, yet... I hope Emperor Yu can successfully forge his path!"

He might be the first to transform directly from a living being into a powerful necromancer.

Wan Tiansheng bowed deeply. "Thank you, my friend!"

"There's no need for such formality, Director Wan!" Hetu sighed as he looked at him.

Friend... a fellow cultivator. Su Yu's path of cultivation is not solitary; at least, there are those willing to make sacrifices for him.

The necromancers exchanged glances, their expressions complex. In a lifetime of cultivation, perhaps what everyone desires most is a group of like-minded companions.
