Chapter 832: The Mystery of the Three Body Method

Celestial River of Death.

Su Yu furrowed his brows slightly. The Undead Emperor was incredibly powerful, likely stronger than the Culture King and his peers. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to project his power here. But now, it was clear that he had indeed projected his power, which changed everything.

If the Undead Emperor left a mark before he departed, then the power that just vanished was definitely something he had just projected.

"The situation inside the Heaven Gate is very complicated!" Su Yu murmured to himself. It was definitely not ordinary. Even a being like the Undead Emperor seemed unable to enter and exit freely. Was he there voluntarily, or was he sealed?

There must be many powerful beings inside. Were they all from the era of the Opening of Heaven? Could it be that the Opening of Heaven era had more powerful beings than the Chaos era? Perhaps... it was truly possible.

After the Time Master opened the heavens, the Dao was born. If there were people like those in Su Yu's world back then...

Su Yu was slightly taken aback. Right, when the Time Master opened the heavens, didn't anyone achieve enlightenment and ascend? If at that time, they directly became rulers of laws, with the Time Master's immense power covering the myriad realms, the first batch of Dao experts born would likely be top-tier beings.

"Could it be that the beings sealed during the Opening of Heaven era are the ones the Culture King and his peers are fighting against?" Thoughts flashed through his mind, but unfortunately, there was too little information. Su Yu couldn't discern the truth!

However, at this moment, Su Yu couldn't dwell on these thoughts. He felt his world expanding once more, a force of yin and yang enveloping it. In the distance, within the chaos, the projection of the Undead Emperor in Su Yu's world began to change.

A tremendous force surged from his body!

Moments later, a scholarly middle-aged man with his hair tied in a bun appeared, dressed in a blue robe, his expression complex, with starlight flickering around him. Seeing Su Yu, he bowed and said, "Thank you, Your Majesty, for your assistance!"

At this moment, chaos thundered, but the Undead Emperor paid it little mind. At his level, ordinary heavenly punishments couldn't harm him! Moreover, Su Yu's world was much stronger than before.

When the thunder dissipated, the Undead Emperor stepped out from the world, his aura continuously rising. Su Yu sensed it and realized that the Undead Emperor had surpassed the fourth tier, likely entering the third tier.

He seemed weaker than the Martial Emperor, probably at the weaker end of the third tier. Still, it was quite impressive! He was now the strongest under Su Yu's command, aside from the Martial Emperor. Even the South Heavenly King, within Su Yu's world, was only at the stronger end of the fourth tier. The Chaos Dragon was about the same.

"Congratulations!" Su Yu smiled. The Undead Emperor sighed deeply, adjusting to his new body, and said with a complex tone, "I've drifted through one era after another, and now, reborn in this world... I wonder how long I can live."

With a hint of self-mockery, as a defeated being who died at the end of the Opening of Heaven era and was now revived, his feelings were indeed complex. In the Human Emperor's era, he never spoke of submission or compromise, but now, he was revived thanks to Su Yu!

Su Yu laughed, "Who knows how long you can live! But don't you think this era is exciting? If you don't revive now and remain an undead, you might miss out on a lot of excitement! I think this era is more exciting than any other!"

The Time Master, the Undead Emperor, the Human Emperor, the Human Ancestor—among these people, perhaps only the Human Ancestor and the Undead Emperor had crossed paths. The others had never fought each other, belonging to different eras!

But in this era, they might encounter each other! There's also the Culture King, and me, and many others...

Su Yu smiled. This era is so interesting! If you miss this chance, there might not be another.

The Undead Emperor paused, nodding slightly, "It is indeed interesting... I also wonder if the elites and prodigies of our era will return to the world!"

Su Yu laughed, "In your era, besides the Human Ancestor, were there other prodigies?"

"There were!" The Undead Emperor nodded, "That era was incredibly brilliant! Before me, some had even seen the Demon Ancestor, the Immortal Ancestor, and the Divine Ancestor!"

He sighed, "The entire Opening of Heaven era was the most exciting! That period was a time of flourishing, with myriad paths contending, chaos mingling with the myriad races, coming from chaos and returning to chaos... Actually, I was just a minor figure at the end of the Opening of Heaven era. Those top-tier beings, those unparalleled figures, only exist in legends!"

"The ancestors of the myriad races might all appear..."

He seemed to be predicting a grand era of the return of powerful beings from various eras!

Su Yu, however, frowned deeply, "You mean, the myriad races... all have ancestors?"

The Undead Emperor chuckled, "Your Majesty... you're joking!"

Of course, they do!

"Your Majesty wouldn't think that the Dao of the Immortal, Demon, Divine, and Dragon realms were all pioneered by the current people, right? The suppression of realms only appeared in ancient times, right? Including the opening of the myriad realms... May I ask Your Majesty, is it difficult for you to open a realm now?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said solemnly, "It's not easy!"

Opening a realm! The myriad realms were opened by the Time Master, but those small realms were opened by the races themselves. So, the people who opened realms back then were also very powerful!

Su Yu said solemnly, "I used to think that the myriad realms were also opened by the Time Master..."

"The large realms were, but not the small ones!" The Undead Emperor shook his head, "The Time Master opened the entire large realm. After that, some people, including some ancient chaotic beasts, entered the myriad realms to open their own small realms! Where their Dao was, they opened realms! As a result, myriad realms stood tall, but some realms have long since perished, some were opened later... some simply took advantage of the situation, occupying realms after the original ones perished."

"The ancestors of the myriad races?" Su Yu murmured, how many have died, and how many are still alive? Where are they? Inside the Heaven Gate?

Because, strictly speaking, these beings are all from the Opening of Heaven era. Chaos is not as strong as the Opening of Heaven... At this moment, Su Yu suddenly had an epiphany!

Why is the Heaven Gate stronger? Because the powerful beings in chaos might have settled in the myriad realms after the Time Master opened the heavens, merging with the River of Time, reducing the number of powerful beings in chaos. Those with ambition all came to the myriad realms!

"So, chaos is not as strong as the Opening of Heaven... then what does the Human Gate seal?"

Su Yu thought of the Human Gate, which might be related to the Human Ancestor. Could it be that the Human Gate seals the ancient times? But the ancient times have continued to this day!

The Human Gate might not seal the ancient era! Thoughts rose one by one in Su Yu's mind. At this moment, because of the Undead Emperor's words, he thought of many things.

Soon, Su Yu suppressed everything! Don't think about these things! Too much information flooded his mind, making it hard for Su Yu to digest it all at once. He couldn't grasp the useful information. For now, just remember it. When inspiration strikes, everything will naturally be deduced.

Su Yu didn't continue on this topic, smiling, "Not bad, third tier! At the end of the ancient times, you'd be at the level of the Battle King and his peers!"

The Undead Emperor smiled faintly, neither sad nor happy, having nothing much to say about his strength. A being from the end of the Opening of Heaven era, perhaps even older than Hongmeng, and now, he was only like this, relying on Su Yu's favor, there was nothing worth being happy about.

Of course, Hongmeng rarely felt inferior. With his immense age, he spent most of his time sleeping, never considering himself old. Claiming to be young would be an understatement.

At this moment, Su Yu looked at Liu Hong. Liu Hong was pale, having been scared out of his wits earlier, almost thinking he was doomed because the Undead Emperor appeared. Fortunately, he was safe now!

At this moment, he was still in shock, saying, "The Undead Emperor is truly domineering, unlike the Time Master!"

The Time Master, you see, the Undead Emperor, Human Emperor, and Su Yu are all taking advantage of him, and he doesn't react. Either he's truly gone, completely disappeared, in deep slumber, or he simply doesn't care about being taken advantage of.

Hearing this, Su Yu also laughed, "Indeed, but... it's hard to say about the Time Master. For us, our world is the foundation, the everything, but the Time Master swept through chaos even before opening the heavens! Perhaps the River of Time was just something he created for fun. Compared to him, there's no comparison!"

Now, Su Yu increasingly felt the terror of the Time Master. The Undead Emperor, Su Yu could still dare to provoke, thinking he could catch up, but the Time Master, Su Yu wondered if he could really catch up to him.

A terrifying existence! Of course, Su Yu wasn't discouraged, laughing, "Let's not talk about them! Now that the Undead King is revived, it's a good thing. We just talked about the Three Body Method. Liu Hong, connect the three paths here, be my third connector, Undead King... come with me to the myriad realms."

Saying this, Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Is it appropriate to call you the Undead King now?"

He's revived! The Undead Emperor didn't mind, chuckling, "As Your Majesty wishes."

Su Yu didn't say more, alright, let's leave it at that. Should I call him King Chen? Sun, Moon, Stars... Su Yu joked, "Did people from your era all like names like Sun, Moon, Stars, Constellations... was there anyone simply called Sun?"

"..." The Undead Emperor was speechless for a moment before saying, "There was, Sun... was actually a supreme being! It's hard to say specifically, but I know that the descendant of Star might be the one everyone calls the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu was taken aback. Star! Xingyu, Xingyue... could it be that they really had the surname Xing? Just like how the Human Ancestor was called Zhou, so his descendants all had the surname Zhou.

The Undead Emperor noticed Su Yu's momentary distraction and chuckled, "Sun, Moon, Stars... these are rather common names. There are others with the same names, but for the strong, it's easier to have a bloodline legacy!"

"Your name, Chen, doesn't seem simple," Su Yu remarked.

The Undead Emperor self-deprecatingly replied, "It's not that it's not simple. It's just that there weren't many cultivating the power of the stars back then, so I casually picked a name for myself."

Su Yu nodded and continued, "The Human Ancestor was called Zhou. According to you, the Human Emperor's ancestor was named Xing. Were they from the same era?"

"They were, but whether they had any interaction, I don't know."

He added, "The Human Ancestor... to be honest, the Human Ancestor was actually just a leader of a branch of the human race."

"What do you mean?" Su Yu asked, looking at him.

The Undead Emperor explained, "At that time, the Myriad Realms were in chaos, and humans were scattered across the realms, even in the chaos itself. There were several human tribes and groups... The Human Ancestor was the leader of a large tribe! Of course, later on, as the Human Ancestor grew stronger and gained fame, other tribes gradually joined him. The Human Ancestor indeed had significant achievements, leading the human race to rise during the era of the Myriad Realms! The Giant Race should be his direct tribe, so it's normal for people like Hundred Battle King and Yu to remain with the Giant Race."

That was a tribe directly under the Human Ancestor!

Su Yu understood and nodded, "I see. I thought the Human Ancestor created a race later on, but it turns out it was his direct tribe from the start?"

"Yes!" The Undead Emperor nodded. "That's why I mentioned these things. It seems like Your Majesty has been influenced by Hundred Battle King and others, perhaps thinking the Human Ancestor also betrayed the human race... but that's not the case. He might have favored his tribe later on, which is human nature! However, he was indeed the common ancestor of humans during that era!"

He spoke frankly, believing Su Yu might be influenced by some people, so he explained a bit.

Su Yu smiled, "The way you put it, it sounds normal. Everyone has their own direct line, and nurturing them is quite normal!"

The Undead Emperor also smiled, "Actually, if we trace it back... gods, demons, immortals, souls... these humanoid beings should all be considered the same race! But when some strong individuals emerged, they might have taken their followers to open new realms, cultivating different methods and paths, eventually forming distinct races!"

Su Yu wasn't surprised by this. It had been speculated long ago, and there was nothing new about it. Just like the Control King's lineage, which Su Yu had almost wiped out, if left alone for tens of thousands of years, perhaps a new Holy Race would have emerged!

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Let's go take a look at the Giant Race. They should have some Eternals. I haven't bothered with them before, and the matters of Hundred Battle King... according to you, these people are subordinates of the Human Ancestor, so there's no need to exterminate their entire race! Never mind, let's catch someone practicing the Three Body Method for you to see. Today, I suddenly became interested in the Three Body Method!"

"So am I!" The Undead Emperor laughed, also intrigued.

The Three Body Method?

Truly unique!

...

After a while.

The two appeared in the Myriad Realms.

Soon, Su Yu appeared above the Giant Race. Since Hundred Battle King was killed, Yu and Zhou Ji entered the Gate of Hell, and Thunderstorm was killed, the Giant Race had completely fallen silent.

The Ancient Giant King wasn't actually dead!

Last time, he was severely injured by Su Yu's punch, which ironically saved his life. Because he was injured, he didn't participate in the great battle and thus escaped a calamity.

However, when the injured Ancient Giant King sensed some different auras spreading, he sighed in despair and pessimism, thinking that his race might be doomed!

Su Yu had finally remembered the Ancient Giant Race!

...

Soon, the Ancient Giant King, with his heavily injured body, led over a dozen Eternals and several Daofuse Realm giants out of their world.

Without a word, the Ancient Giant King removed his crown, took off his royal robe, knelt on the ground, and offered the Giant Race's royal seal with both hands. Behind him, a group of Ancient Giant Race experts also knelt.

The Ancient Giant King didn't look at Su Yu, keeping his head down, holding the royal seal with both hands, and softly said, "Our race surrenders, we submit! We hope His Majesty Emperor Yu will accept us. All of our Sun and Moon Realm and above are here, willing to sever our paths to atone!"

"In consideration of our ancient lineage... we plead for Emperor Yu's forgiveness!"

"We plead for Emperor Yu's forgiveness!"

A group of Eternals and Daofuse Realm experts all lowered their heads, bowing to the ground.

Those above the Sun and Moon Realm were willing to sever their paths and fall, only hoping Su Yu would spare the ordinary members of the Giant Race, preserving their fire!

This was war!

The defeated, even if they were kings, had to plead with the victors to spare their race, to spare the younger generation!

And the strong were willing to die, only hoping the race would not perish!

Su Yu looked at him and said indifferently, "You've transferred some people during this time, haven't you?"

The Ancient Giant King's face turned pale.

Su Yu said calmly, "I never intended to exterminate your race! Although I hate Hundred Battle King, I know that even if he defeated me, he wouldn't wipe out the human race!"

In this regard, Su Yu didn't slander Hundred Battle King.

Even if Hundred Battle King defeated Su Yu, the possibility of exterminating the human race was low; he almost certainly wouldn't do it. At most, he would let the human race fend for themselves!

Upon hearing this, the Ancient Giant King was overjoyed and wept with joy, prostrating on the ground, "Emperor Yu is wise! Even Hundred Battle King... would not annihilate the human race! Heaven and earth bear witness!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "Alright, I have no interest in the ordinary Giant Race! As for you, I don't necessarily have to kill you. Do some experiments for me. If you survive, you survive; if you die, you die. Whether you live or not depends on your luck! If you want revenge later... just come find me!"

"We wouldn't dare!"

How could the Ancient Giant King dare to say anything about revenge?

Impossible!

Su Yu was too terrifying!

Su Yu didn't care much about this. If they wanted revenge, they could try. Besides, they might not even survive. Su Yu needed them to experiment with the Three Body Method. Su Yu directly asked, "Are you practicing the Three Body Method or other methods?"

"The Three Body Method!"

The Ancient Giant King immediately replied, "After the ancient times, we all practiced the Three Body Method. I'm not an ancient marquis, so I didn't practice methods like the Weapon Fusion Method. I've always practiced the Three Body Method..."

Su Yu nodded, reached out, and directly crushed him!

Behind him, those Eternals and Daofuse Realm experts all changed their expressions, but they only dared to show sorrow, not daring to look up.

Resist?

Resistance would lead to the extinction of their race!

Not resisting meant the strong would die, but the weak could live!

They were at the mercy of others!

At this moment, Su Yu crushed the opponent, directly destroying his sea of will and shattering his body, but he didn't sever his path.

Moments later, the winds surged, and the River of Time appeared. Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, carefully observing. In the blink of an eye, an aura rose, and on a path in the River of Time, there was a slight tremor. The next moment, the Ancient Giant King reappeared.

He was resurrected!

One of the three bodies had died!

His strength was significantly weakened, but Su Yu carefully examined him. After a while, he raised an eyebrow and said, "Amazing! His strength has only decreased, and the power of laws has been greatly reduced, but his life imprint is intact! His sea of will has also recovered!"

Su Yu found it fascinating. He hadn't paid much attention before.

Now, as a creator of the heavens, he couldn't quite see how the resurrection was happening.

The Undead Emperor was also amazed, "He really resurrected, and it's a complete resurrection... just a portion of the power of laws was severed. This Three Body Method... is incredible!"

It was truly incredible!

This was his first time witnessing the peculiarities of the Three Body Method!

In ancient times, during the era when he was sealed, the Three Body Method was vaguely spreading, but it was too weak, and almost no one practiced it.

Why practice a weaker method when there were orthodox methods available?

The Undead Emperor watched for a while and shook his head, "I can't understand it!"

Su Yu, however, vaguely understood something. He waved his hand again, and just as the Ancient Giant King was resurrected for a moment, he struck down with a palm, directly killing him, even severing his path!

The Ancient Giant King seemed to be walking the path of the physical body.

Su Yu directly dispersed his power of the path!

And this time, he was resurrected again. Of course, Su Yu took his time. With the Heaven Gate open, he could see something. A force emerged from the River of Time, and gradually, the dissipated life imprint began to gather.

The opponent was resurrected once more!

Two of the three bodies had fallen!

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King's aura was weak, barely maintaining the strength of the Daofuse Realm.

"Is this your future body?" Su Yu asked, and the Ancient Giant King, pale-faced, nodded, "Future body!"

"Interesting!" Su Yu smiled, "The Three Body Method, with the past as the foundation, the present as the base, and the future as the illusion! Dying in the future isn't a big deal; dying in the present still holds hope, but dying in the past is like a rootless duckweed..."

Su Yu murmured, "Fascinating! This is collecting all the scattered imprints in the River of Time, dividing them into three parts... no, it's gathering every bit of oneself, leaving nothing behind! The power of origin?"

One thought after another emerged, and Su Yu suddenly asked, "Are there any Eternals or Daofuse Realm experts who have practiced the Three Body Method and resurrected?"

He thought carefully, "Hetu is from the first tide, and he didn't practice the Three Body Method! Lanshan and the others are ancient people, and Xia Chen followed the path of divine characters, the path of the Battle King, not the Three Body Method..."

At this point, Su Yu looked at the Undead Emperor, "In recent days, has there been any resurrection of those who practiced the Three Body Method?"

"Seems... not?"

Probably not!

The Undead Emperor thought for a moment and shook his head; indeed, there hadn't been.

After ancient times, few strong individuals had resurrected.

Hetu and Xia Chen were representative!

Su Yu had also asked people to search, like some founders of academies, such as Ye Batian, but they hadn't been found.

At this moment, Su Yu's eyes flickered, "Those who practiced the Three Body Method... probably have no chance of resurrection!"

Chapter 1: The Three Bodies and Their Origins

In the vast expanse of the River of Time, Su Yu stood contemplatively, his thoughts swirling around the mysteries of the Three Body Method. "Three bodies, three origins," he mused, "everything is integrated into the original source. Your past imprint, your future imprint, they've all dissipated. The Celestial River of Death can't really connect to any origin anymore!"

Shaking his head, Su Yu continued, "So, for those cultivating the Three Body Method, don't expect to emerge from the Celestial River of Death!"

This was a new discovery! Previously, everyone thought it was a matter of insufficient time, but in reality, it was because the Three Body Method gathered all the power of the origin. When the three bodies perished, the entire origin was obliterated! There was no chance of revival!

In that case, if Ye Batian wasn't a pawn arranged by the Great Zhou King, then his death was truly final! Because it seemed he had cultivated the Three Body Method...

Or perhaps not!

Su Yu's eyes flickered. It seemed Ye Batian hadn't actually cultivated the Three Body Method. It wasn't entirely clear, but when Ye Batian died, Su Yu had seen in Wan Tiansheng's memories that he was directly killed. As for Wan Tiansheng, he did have past and future bodies at one point, but after one of them died, he abandoned the cultivation of the Three Body Method.

"I think I understand now!" Su Yu's eyes sparkled with realization. Ignoring the Ancient Giant King, he suddenly struck down another Eternal, waiting for the opponent to revive. He observed the changes in the River of Time, murmuring, "The separation of the three bodies, three bodies, three origins... It's actually about using everything to cultivate, everything to gamble! Collecting all the traces of your life..."

In truth, a normal person, even without following the Three Body Method, should have two lives! When they die, they transform into a spirit! Spirits... can still be revived! Or maybe there are three lives, and they can die once more. Whether they can be revived again... that's hard to say!

As Su Yu's thoughts raced, he continued to strike down, saying lightly, "I want to observe. If I understand before I kill all of you, you might all survive one body... But if I don't understand, then I'll kill all three bodies until you're all dead, or until I figure it out!"

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King, left with only one body, understood what Su Yu was trying to do. He was researching the ancient, supposedly useless cultivation method, the Three Body Method! He was observing and studying, and if he couldn't figure it out... everyone would die. But if he could see something before everyone's three bodies were completely destroyed, perhaps they could still live.

Su Yu, having reached this level, wouldn't deceive them. He continued to strike, killing the second Eternal's two bodies, and soon, his eyes flickered as he began to strike the third!

One by one, over a dozen Eternal realm experts were struck down by him!

Su Yu murmured, "Three bodies, three deaths, death of the three bodies... It's also an understanding of life and death! Interesting... Understanding life and death and then reviving... It's a pity for the Hundred Battle King. He didn't follow the path of the Three Bodies, otherwise, if he tried being struck down, I think he wouldn't be so despairing..."

This was also a kind of death experience!

At this moment, Su Yu was muttering to himself, constantly observing the changes in the entire River of Time, with a thoughtful expression, continuously striking down one expert after another, constantly observing!

The Undead Emperor was also observing, but unfortunately, he couldn't see much. However, he vaguely sensed something.

...

It was unclear how much time had passed.

Suddenly, Su Yu struck down an expert, and a gleam of light flashed in his eyes, as if he had made a significant discovery.

At this moment, around the Ancient Giant King, there were only five or six Eternals left, with the others having perished. These remaining Eternals continuously shielded the Ancient Giant King, their dual bodies having been destroyed, and now Su Yu was destroying their third bodies!

The Ancient Giant King felt a sense of sorrow and despair, but he had been prepared for this outcome when he came out. Death didn't bring despair; what made him despair was that Su Yu had given a glimmer of hope, only to extinguish it by continuously striking down their third bodies!

Just as he was in despair, Su Yu's eyes suddenly flickered, and he smiled, "Lucky! A few of you survived after all. Well, since I said you could live, seek your own fortune!"

With that, he laughed and vanished instantly!

He had found a clue!

Once they left, the Ancient Giant King and his group gasped for breath, feeling a mix of relief and sorrow. Seven or eight experts had died, but it was already much better than expected.

Su Yu hadn't come to annihilate their race, nor had he killed them all.

"Seal the realm!" The Ancient Giant King felt a sense of sorrow and self-mockery. Yu... Zhou Ji... Alas!

When Tiangu and the others fled, they took their clansmen with them.

But when Yu and the others fled, they didn't negotiate with Su Yu about sparing the Giant Race.

Indeed, in their eyes, there was only the Human Ancestor, only their own path, and they didn't care about the Giant Race.

If Zhou Ji had talked to Su Yu, Su Yu probably wouldn't have cared much about the Giant Race. They could have taken them away, but unfortunately... they didn't!

The Ancient Giant King wore a sorrowful expression. Those two were not good leaders for their race. Or rather, they weren't qualified.

"They only pursued their own pursuits... lacking the most important thing... responsibility..."

The Ancient Giant King thought with a sense of melancholy.

So be it!

It's fine!

From now on, they could give up hope on those people, even if they emerged from the Gate of Hell, they could give up hope.

Whether it was Tiangu, the Divine Empress, or Su Yu, the Human Emperor... even the Hundred Battle King, if he wasn't dead and sought escape, they might not give up on their race... Well, maybe they overestimated the Hundred Battle King, because six thousand years ago, he gave up too!

But that was because the Hundred Battle King didn't consider himself part of the Human Race!

At this moment, countless thoughts flashed through the mind of the heavily injured Ancient Giant King. In the next moment, they returned to their domain, and the entire Giant Realm rumbled, sealing itself completely!

Even if the Gate of Hell opened... the Giant Realm would no longer welcome those leaders who abandoned their race!

They were not leaders!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu's eyes flickered with excitement, "Three bodies, three origins, collecting all the imprints in the River of Time. Actually, the Three Body Method is a method of gathering origins!"

"Of course, there's a downside. Once you die, you're dead, and the Celestial River of Death can't guide you anymore!"

Su Yu kept talking, grinning, "So, the Three Bodies, actually anyone can cultivate them. This thing has always existed! And I, in fact, have left imprints in the River of Time, as does everyone else!"

"The Three Body Method is actually the true 'All Paths Lead to Me'... Instead of saying the three bodies are separate, it's actually dispersing. Cultivating a single body leaves a lot of origins in the River of Time!"

Beside him, the Undead Emperor listened silently. After Su Yu spoke for a while, he said, "Your Majesty means that the past body and future body have always existed, as manifestations of the overflow of origins..."

Su Yu nodded, taking a deep breath, "Who created this Three Body Method? They must be a formidable character! It's like you spirits merging the origins in the Celestial River of Death! The River of Time also overflows with origins, though not as obviously as the Celestial River of Death!"

"And the creator of the Three Body Method, they're the real ones plucking wool, seizing the imprints in the River of Time, just like me robbing the Lord of the Dead!"

Su Yu kept calculating, and soon, his eyes flickered, "It might have something to do with the Human Emperor and those people, because later, the rules didn't allow everyone to cultivate other methods, only the Three Body Method! This was to strip everyone's life imprints from the River of Time, even cutting off the expansion of the Celestial River of Death!"

"If this person wasn't a creator of the heavens with other plans, then they had a grudge with the Lord of Time and the Lord of the Dead! Was it the Human Emperor?"

Su Yu wasn't sure!

Impressive!

This Three Body Method, known as the most useless cultivation method, but... what if those like Su Yu who followed his path could also gather the three bodies?

That would mean gaining two more physical bodies for free!

"The past, the future... It's one thing to gather the past, but even the future is taken... This is to sever all foundations in the River of Time!"

Su Yu licked his lips, feeling that he might have discovered something extraordinary.

The owner of the Three Body Method might have a grand scheme targeting certain people.

Or perhaps, it was just an accidental creation of the Three Body Method, but the owner of the method must have an extremely deep understanding of origins. This isn't something ordinary people can comprehend, and Su Yu only gained some understanding after reviving some people.

Simply put, the Three Body Method is like the Undead Emperor and others, allowing everyone to merge the origins in the River of Time. This way, the River of Time can't retain power.

The power is actually still your own!

But, like a goose plucking feathers, the River of Time also plucks feathers, though perhaps not as much as the Celestial River of Death.

At this moment, the Undead Emperor also understood, saying in a deep voice, "Your Majesty means that if we can find the past and future bodies and integrate them into our true selves, everyone can instantly progress in strength like us?"

If so... that would be terrifying!

Wouldn't Su Yu and these people all become powerful?

Su Yu, however, shook his head, "Difficult! Not everyone can do it. For example, those who have lost their past and future bodies and switched to other methods probably have no chance!"

He was referring to people like the Great Qin King!

The power of origins has actually been consumed by them. Now, finding the past and future bodies might not be possible, but... not necessarily, the past and future are countless, and these people might not have taken all the past and future.

Old Wan once told Su Yu, constantly nesting dolls, the past and future constantly merging... it's actually about continuously integrating scattered origins!

Perhaps, what everyone is integrating now is just the tip of the iceberg!

Su Yu licked his lips, "I'm curious about one thing now... Did the Human Emperor and the others integrate the past and future? If not... it's an opportunity, of course, it might not be so easy to find the past and future bodies!"

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly realized that this Three Body Method might be a turning point to change the entire situation!

As for whether it truly works, I'll have to try it myself to find out!

If I can become stronger, and others can also become stronger, then together we can drive each other to new heights... This mutual empowerment could potentially lead to a complete reversal of power on Su Yu's side!

However, for those who have been resurrected as undead, there might be no hope. Their original essence has already been fused away. For instance, the Undead Emperor is beyond hope. But the Martial Emperor... even if the Human Emperor and the others are aware of these circumstances and have integrated them, the Martial Emperor is definitely unaware!

Therefore, the Martial Emperor might still have a chance for improvement! Of course, I can't tell the Martial Emperor about this now. If he becomes truly powerful, who knows if he might rebel again.

"Unless I can keep suppressing him!"

Su Yu thought to himself, feeling a bit excited. Could it really be possible to capture the past and future? It's known to be a unique ability of the Sunmoon Realm, but I am far beyond the Sunmoon Realm now!

"Then again... I'm only capturing the essence, so whether it's Sunmoon or not shouldn't matter much..."

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Su Yu felt a surge of excitement. Without wasting any more time, he vanished. With his newfound strength, he had enough confidence to lead others upstream!

P.S.: I'm utterly exhausted. Since the new plot hasn't started yet, I might take a day off tomorrow. If I do, I'll post a single chapter to let you know. Reaching 800,000 words shouldn't be a problem. I've written nearly 290,000 words in just 10 days, with 21 days left. It's truly daunting! (These words are not charged.)

(End of Chapter)
