Chapter 737: The Space Ancient Beasts

The Great Ming King spoke of needing eight formation bases, which essentially meant that the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King had to sacrifice their limbs for rebirth. The newly regenerated limbs wouldn't be as powerful as the current ones, but there was no other choice at the moment.

To hide within Chaos Mountain, they had to conceal their myriad auras to avoid clashing with the chaotic paths, which would lead to an ancient beast siege. The Heavenly Kings needed to have the ability to act independently. Otherwise, if the grand formation was broken, it would spell trouble.

Su Yu didn't say much. At this juncture, everyone had to do what they could. He looked at the others and said, "My Mark of Civilization might be able to hide a few people, but not too many. If there are too many, the aura will be too strong, exceeding the suppression limit of the Mark of Civilization, and it might be detected. Does anyone want to hide in the Mark of Civilization?"

Hiding one or two wouldn't be a problem. The issue was that too many people had come this time.

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "We'll pass. Let Doubao and Flatbread Senior hide inside. They are incarnations of the Dao, so even if discovered, it would just seem like you've comprehended a few more Great Dao rules... no one will think too much of it."

The Iron Devourer Race were all incarnations of the Dao, akin to having two more divine characters. Doubao also possessed second-tier top-level Daofuse combat strength, just a step away from being a Heavenly King, so its strength was still considerable.

Doubao didn't mind, lazily saying, "Sleeping anywhere is the same!"

After all, it didn't care where it slept.

Su Yu smiled and said, "Let's see. First, let's make arrangements. April, on your side... Marquis Giant Bamboo must stay. Otherwise, if a Heavenly King is missing, the myriad races will definitely suspect."

He glanced at May and Full Moon, pondering, "Besides me and Lantian, others disguising themselves might easily be exposed, so it's best if one of you three stays."

May grumbled, "I'll stay."

April looked at Su Yu and said, "Human Lord, let me stay! You can impersonate May, and Lantian can continue impersonating Full Moon. I'm stronger than May, so staying behind can provide more help..."

Su Yu hesitated, "But April, according to the previous plan, you would become a spokesperson in the decision-making layer..."

April grinned, "It's fine. May is my son. I don't want to do it anymore, so let my son take over. It's the old rule of our Iron Devourer Race! If the father doesn't want to do it, the son takes over. I'll just say I have a headache after one meeting and let you go. No one will suspect."

He still hoped May could retreat, as mingling among the myriad races was dangerous.

Su Yu didn't say more and addressed everyone, "Now, I'll take you to see the Space Ancient Beast Race... There might not be a teleportation gate. If there isn't, we'll have to retreat for now!"

If a few Heavenly Sovereigns were sweeping the area, one or two people might have a chance to hide. But if ten or twenty top-tier experts wanted to hide, did they really think the Heavenly Sovereigns were blind?

Previously, the Heavenly Sovereigns couldn't recklessly unleash their willpower to sweep the area. Once the various races migrated, these experts would have no scruples.

General Yingwu, who had just returned, sighed, "Luckily, I brought my soldiers from First Line Gorge. Otherwise, if we were swept away, it would be hard to escape!"

"Fortunately, we followed Emperor Yu. Otherwise, in this great sweep, we would have suffered!"

For years, the myriad races hadn't swept the dangerous lands. Now, even the dangerous lands were being swept. If they had done this years ago, none of the six Daofuse experts would have survived.

Su Yu laughed, "Every action has its consequences. Without our interference, the myriad races wouldn't have united like this. The three major races are just taking advantage of the situation! Plus, the Control King's lineage is also causing trouble, having wiped out the Nether Race, and we took down the Dragon Race. With two major races gone, the other races have no room to resist."

Without him and the Control King's lineage, cooperation among the myriad races wouldn't have been so simple.

It could only be said that some things were bound to happen with their interference.

General Yingwu nodded slightly, then said with some concern, "I'm worried that some old friends might still be alive in the Source of the Dao... If that's the case..."

"Do your best and leave the rest to fate!"

Su Yu could only say this. The priority was to preserve the forces under his command. As for the Source of the Dao, they could check it out if they had time.

"April, you organize the Iron Devourer Race's migration... No need to rush, ten days will do!"

"Alright!"

April nodded.

Su Yu looked at Marquis Giant Bamboo, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, I'll have to trouble you to bring my people back."

Xia Longwu and the others had left earlier. Now that the myriad races were sweeping, Su Yu couldn't show himself, so he looked to Marquis Giant Bamboo, "Even if you're discovered, don't worry too much... Just bring them back!"

Whether Xia Longwu and the others went to Chaos Mountain didn't matter much. Their strength wasn't high, and hiding in the Mark of Civilization, the myriad races wouldn't sense them.

They weren't Daofuse, so they could hide anywhere.

Marquis Giant Bamboo nodded. Su Yu looked at Lantian, who quickly split off a clone, smiling, "Just follow my clone. They know the situation now and are ready to retreat."

"Then I'll be off!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't delay. Before the Heavenly Sovereigns finished with Ren Mountain, he needed to settle everything.

...

Su Yu led the group swiftly towards the territory of the Space Ancient Beast Race.

Meanwhile, in the Upper Realm, some places were filled with lament, while others were jubilant.

Not all races were unwilling to migrate. Some small races, lacking strength, were nearly scared to death recently. Migrating under the protection of a major race was a good thing.

The ones truly dissatisfied were probably the Phoenix Race, Ape Race, and other relatively strong races. Migrating together meant they might completely lose their racial voice, falling under the control of the three major races.

This time, the ones losing power were these medium-sized races.

One group after another packed their belongings and started moving towards Chaos Mountain in the extreme west.

The entire Upper Realm was undergoing a great migration.

...

At Ren Mountain.

At this moment, six Heavenly Sovereign-level experts had arrived.

With a roar from Desolate Heavenly Sovereign, the power of the earth erupted, causing the entire world to tremble. Yet the massive Ren Mountain remained unmoved, clearly not something ordinary people could relocate.

Back then, this Ren Mountain was moved from Chaos Mountain by several rulers of laws.

However, it had been severed.

The six Heavenly Sovereign-level experts roared, and soon, the massive divine mountain trembled slightly, then began to rise from the ground, slightly airborne.

Clearly, the mountain hadn't been fully crafted back then, so no grand formation was set up. Otherwise, even the Heavenly Sovereigns couldn't move it.

"Ren Mountain..."

Heavenly Sovereign Mo sighed, "Just this one mountain is a struggle for the six of us to move. The human race of the past was truly terrifyingly powerful!"

At this moment, the six experts stood on six sides, exerting all their strength to lift the massive mountain.

Hearing Mo's sigh, Desolate Heavenly Sovereign said with difficulty, "They were powerful, otherwise how could they unify the Myriad Realms? With so many rulers of laws among the races, they all had to submit. It was said to be co-governance of the myriad races... but wasn't it just the human race dominating?"

He continued, panting slightly, "That's why, in that era, everyone knew that for tens of thousands of years, we were like prisoners, imprisoned in the Luminous Domain Mansion! Generation after generation, the human race wanted to assimilate us... In time, there might be no more myriad races, only the human race!"

"Our predecessors resisted, fought back, for the survival of our races... We too seek survival! The human race wanted to assimilate the myriad races, how could we surrender?"

Even Destiny Marquis and March couldn't refute this.

The resistance of the myriad races wasn't about right or wrong.

The human race sought unification, the myriad races resisted. No race wanted to be colonized, which was normal.

However, the human race was powerful, and standing on their side was also a matter of survival.

If the myriad races were powerful, someone would eventually develop ambitions... The three major races had annexed many small races over the years, and they knew it.

"Survival of the fittest!"

In the distance, Thunderstorm coldly stated, revealing the essence of it all.

The Heavenly Sovereigns laughed.

Indeed, that was the essence.

Every era was like this!

As Desolate Heavenly Sovereign and the others moved the mountain westward, they chatted. Such opportunities were rare, as they usually cultivated alone.

At this moment, Desolate Heavenly Sovereign asked, "What do you all think of the Great Dao rules in the Source of the Dao?"

Heavenly Sovereign Mo calmly replied, "The rules are incomplete, flawed! Even the River of Time in the Upper Realm is incomplete! If I'm not mistaken, the River of Time in the Upper Realm is more akin to the Death Path, and the rules born from it are similar to those in the Death Realm... They have limits and some flaws..."

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign nodded slightly, "Indeed, I feel the same. Last time, those few were quickly suppressed and killed... that's a big problem! I'm worried that the Chaos Race might have similar means, and if so, many of our quasi-kings and Daofuse will be in big trouble."

Over the years, many had borrowed external Great Daos to achieve Daofuse, and many had become quasi-kings.

If they all lost their effectiveness... that would be troublesome.

They looked at Destiny Marquis, and Heavenly Sovereign Mo smiled, "Destiny, do you have any good ideas?"

Destiny Marquis softly said, "Suppressing those who changed paths to achieve the Dao can't be done by just any means! The group that attacked Sealing Mountain probably had some special individuals, one of whom likely opened the Heaven Gate... Perhaps that person's Heaven Gate influence suppressed the power of the Great Dao! Ordinary cultivators can't even see the Great Dao clearly, so how could they suppress it?"

Upon hearing this, the group pondered. Heavenly Sovereign Mo nodded, "Before Sealing Mountain was attacked, I did feel someone spying on me. To spy on me... it was likely due to the Heaven Gate."

"Opening the Heaven Gate... a peerless genius!"

The group sighed, "Is that person really dead?"

Someone glanced at Mo Tianzun and Yue Tianzun. Yue Tianzun spoke softly, "It's hard to say. Such a prodigy might not fall easily! Whether this person is from the Chaos Race or the Torchbearer lineage is still uncertain! In any case, everyone should be more cautious. Moreover, the Chaos Race's attack on the Nether Race this time, despite exposing themselves completely... I believe the Torchbearer lineage truly exists! The group that attacked last time might indeed have come from the lower realm!"

After speaking, he added, "These two sides are likely at odds with each other! Their conflict is actually beneficial, as it exposes both sides. Otherwise, we might still be in the dark!"

With a bitter smile, he continued, "The Human Race's foundation is endless. Kill one group, and another emerges. Honestly, after so many years of killing, we're exhausted, but... at this point, there's no room for reconciliation! And this time, the Chaos lineage dares to act... I suspect their strength isn't weak. Knowing we intend to target Chaos Mountain, yet still daring to act, shows their formidable strength! After 100,000 years of accumulation, their power is beyond our estimation!"

At this moment, several Tianzun sighed.

"Hopefully, there are still some allies in the Source of the Dao!" Desolate Tianzun remarked, "There should be. At the limit, they can only seal themselves to avoid being overwhelmed! However, with the upcoming battles, there's no fear of being overwhelmed by the power of laws... They should emerge soon. If not, they might die without even knowing why!"

There must still be some dormant beings in the Source of the Dao.

Mo Tianzun chuckled, "Let's first move Ren Mountain over, then we'll sweep through the end of the Source of the Dao! The Source of the Dao is a treasure, but... if the Heaven Gate can suppress the Great Dao of the Source of the Dao, its importance diminishes significantly! Destroying it wouldn't be a loss!"

"If we can also flush out some of the old Human Race figures, that would be beneficial!"

The group chuckled and continued moving the massive Ren Mountain. At this moment, the entire Upper Realm gradually witnessed a group of top-tier beings transporting an enormous mountain towards the extreme west.

That mountain required the effort of six Tianzun to move, and even then, the speed wasn't particularly fast. A Tianzun could typically reach the extreme west in a minute or two, crossing millions of miles. But now, at their current pace, it would take five to six days to move the mountain. Ren Mountain was incredibly heavy, and the Tianzun had to take turns resting before continuing.

...

In Chaos Mountain.

Inside a cave.

Yuxi and the others had returned. Yue Hao suddenly frowned, then quickly relaxed, saying calmly, "It seems the Three Great Races have benefited!"

Everyone looked at him.

Yue Hao spoke softly, "The Three Great Races have begun moving Ren Mountain, intending to gather the myriad races there and reestablish the Myriad Race Alliance!"

Upon hearing this, someone turned pale, "Gathering the myriad races?"

"Yes."

Yue Hao nodded.

An old woman said solemnly, "Then why don't we take this opportunity to attack them and disrupt their alliance..."

"No."

Yue Hao shook his head, "If we do that, we'll have to leave Chaos Mountain. The myriad races are prepared now. Regardless of the outcome, leaving Chaos Mountain means losing our geographical advantage! Without it, even if we manage to deal with the myriad races, we'll suffer heavy losses! The Torchbearer lineage hasn't appeared yet. If we fight the myriad races to the end and suffer heavy losses, the Torchbearer lineage will benefit!"

If there were only two forces, a war could break out at any time. But now, it's not feasible. There's a third party involved!

Everyone was frustrated and annoyed. The Torchbearer lineage was a troublemaker! Without this force, they wouldn't be in such a difficult position now.

Yue Hao sighed, then quickly smiled, "The gathering of the myriad races is both bad and good! The bad part is that surprise attacks won't work, and the concentrated power of the myriad races is stronger. The good part is that with the myriad races gathered, all actions are under our watchful eyes, and hidden forces will soon be exposed!"

He continued calmly, "The myriad races have decided to sweep the Upper Realm, which is a good thing! Let those sneaky ones be exposed! There's no need to disrupt them. Recently, don't go out or attack the strong of the myriad races... Let them sweep, sweep the entire Upper Realm clean!"

Exposing all hidden beings is something he wanted to see!

Yue Hao said in a low voice, "The entire Upper Realm has persisted for over 100,000 years. How many are still hiding in the shadows? Did some ancient races that were destroyed really have no strong figures left? Like some powerful ancient races, such as the Soul Race, Gnomes, Skeletons, Asuras... are these races truly extinct?"

In ancient times, powerful races were everywhere. That era was the true era of the myriad races vying for supremacy! Some powerful ancient races were incredibly strong, but now, with the passage of time, they have long disappeared into the annals of history.

Are these races truly extinct? Are there no strong figures left?

It's unclear, unknown. Perhaps they're hiding in the Upper Realm, in the Source of the Dao, in various dangerous places.

Yue Hao supported the myriad races sweeping the Upper Realm.

At this moment, he took a deep breath, "So, let's wait! Perhaps some changes will occur during the myriad races' sweep, causing some hidden and vanished beings to reveal themselves. I also want to see how many have faked their deaths and escaped over the past 100,000 years!"

Everyone looked at him and nodded slightly, feeling a bit heavy-hearted.

Indeed, it's been 100,000 years. The Upper Realm has many dangerous places. In these places, even if no strong figures from various races are hiding, the places themselves have some beings. It's uncertain if some top-tier beings will emerge next.

...

While others awaited the sweep, the territory of the Space Ancient Beast Race arrived.

Outside the dojo.

Su Yu and the others also saw that the entire Space Ancient Beast Race was preparing to migrate.

There weren't many dojos, only three. But the Space Ancient Beast Race had five Daofuse Realm experts, and at least one more remained in the west, making it at least six Daofuse Realm experts.

The dojo didn't represent much. Some Daofuse experts didn't even establish dojos.

Previously, the Space Beast Race expert who helped Ming Tianzun open the Heaven Gate was also inside the dojo.

Beside him, May, who had come along as part of the evacuation target, introduced via voice transmission, "The current clan leader of the Space Ancient Beast Race in the Upper Realm is Marquis Lie Kong!"

"Marquis Lie Kong is also very powerful, reportedly reaching the quasi-king realm, and being from the Space Ancient Beast Race, his mastery of space is profound! Even a Tianzun would find it difficult to kill him."

He could teleport at any time!

Su Yu nodded slightly. The last time he was in the Upper Realm, he actually brought a strong figure from the Space Ancient Beast Race, Kong Kong. However, Kong Kong wasn't here now, but Su Yu knew Kong Kong was nearby.

Should he wait for the Space Ancient Beast Race to migrate before finding the space teleportation gate, or should he go to Marquis Lie Kong now? Su Yu hesitated.

The lower realm couldn't represent the Upper Realm! Cooperation with the Space Ancient Beast Race in the lower realm didn't mean the Upper Realm would cooperate. Otherwise, Su Yu would have already recruited Marquis Destiny.

Su Yu closed his eyes in thought. The Space Ancient Beast Race was about to migrate. Waiting for them to leave before finding the space teleportation gate might be the best choice. The fear was whether there would be any issues, and where exactly the corresponding Chaos Mountain inner perimeter was.

If the other party set up something that would explode the space teleportation gate if activated by non-Space Ancient Beast Race members, it wouldn't be impossible.

This race had six Daofuse Realm experts, not weak in strength, especially since Marquis Lie Kong had Heavenly King-level combat power.

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King, "In the previous nine tidal changes, how did the Space Ancient Beast Race behave?"

"They leaned towards neutrality!"

The Great Zhou King said in a low voice, "Because this race excels in space, neither the myriad races nor the Human Race want to oppose them, as they're quite troublesome! They lean towards neutrality, and the various races don't bother them much."

Leaning towards neutrality!

"What do you think? Should we talk to them now, or wait for them to leave and secretly find the space teleportation gate?"

The group exchanged glances. Wan Tiansheng thought for a moment and said, "Our current strength isn't weak, but it's not enough! If we can recruit them, we should! The cooperation with the Space Ancient Beast Race in the lower realm is a good start..."

He leaned towards negotiating!

The Great Zhou King, however, said softly, "The fear is that they might turn around and betray us!"

"If they pretend to cooperate and inform the myriad races of our location, or if the teleportation destination is near the Control King's lineage... that would be a huge problem for us!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "That's true, but if we tamper with their teleportation gate, wouldn't they know? If they find out, or if they're unsure who did it, they might proactively inform the Three Great Races, which would be even more dangerous!"

He added, "Moreover, is the teleportation gate really fixed in place and not carried with them?"

Wan Tiansheng said softly, "The Great Zhou King is also skilled in space. Fixing a space teleportation gate and carrying it with them isn't impossible, right?"

The Great Zhou King sighed and nodded, "That's possible!"

If so, this trip would be in vain.

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then transmitted to May, "Inform Marquis Giant Bamboo to find Kong Kong and bring him here! The Space Ancient Beast Race is still worth negotiating with! If they betray us... so be it. Our existence isn't exactly a secret. The myriad races and the Control King's lineage know there's a third party."

May didn't say much and quickly sent a message to Marquis Giant Bamboo.

...

After waiting for a while, Su Yu sensed Marquis Giant Bamboo's aura from afar, which quickly disappeared without lingering.

Soon, Kong Kong flew over. This former Yellow Armor Elder had later succeeded in proving the Dao in the Luminous Domain Mansion. Over time, he had made progress, but not significantly.

To Su Yu, his aura felt around the fifth stage of the Eternal Realm.

Chapter 1: The Space Ancient Beast Clan

In the realm of the Space Ancient Beast Clan, a figure known as Kong Kong stood amidst the powerful beings gathered there. His heart skipped a beat upon seeing Su Yu and the others. So many people? It seemed Su Yu had descended to the lower realms to gather more allies.

Kong Kong's gaze shifted forward, recognizing the place. It was the territory of the Space Ancient Beast Clan. "Emperor Yu!" he greeted, bowing slightly. "Lords!" The presence of these powerful figures was suffocating, even more so than the Beast Emperor of his own clan.

Kong Kong was astonished. How had they all grown so much stronger? Even after reaching the Daofuse Realm, they could still improve at such a rapid pace?

Su Yu looked at him for a long moment before speaking, "Kong Kong, we've known each other since our days in the Hunting Heavens Pavilion. Tell me, can you persuade Marquis Lie Kong to join us? Speak plainly, no need for wordplay."

Kong Kong frowned, hesitating before shaking his head. "I can't guarantee it. At best, I can ensure the Space Ancient Beast Clan remains neutral."

He continued, "Rest assured, Emperor Yu. Even if I can't persuade Marquis Lie Kong to join us, our clan's roots are in the lower realm. Unless Marquis Lie Kong wishes for the extinction of our clan below, he won't betray us. He'll pretend not to know anything."

"Our numbers aren't large. In the upper realm, we have fewer than 500. There are more in the lower realm... The Beast Emperor below is closely related to Marquis Lie Kong. He won't betray us."

"Father and son?" Su Yu asked. In the upper and lower realms, connections were often familial or through lineage.

"No..." Kong Kong gave him a peculiar look before finally saying, "They're partners. Marquis Lie Kong is a female space beast... Didn't you know, Emperor Yu?"

"......"

Su Yu was taken aback. Really? He had met Marquis Lie Kong before and never noticed. You're telling me she's female?

Kong Kong felt a bit awkward too. "It's understandable that you didn't know, Emperor Yu. Space beasts, like many races, are hard to distinguish by gender when in their true forms."

Su Yu was left speechless. After a moment, he couldn't help but ask, "May, Kong Kong, in your eyes, are human males and females easy to distinguish? Or do they all look the same?"

"......"

May was embarrassed, but Kong Kong chuckled, "Humans are distinguishable because many races take pride in assuming human form. Humans are naturally gifted. The powerful races—gods, demons, immortals, and spirits—are mostly humanoid. Even the Giant Race and the Fate Clan..."

Kong Kong mused, "In the Myriad Realms, humanoid forms are common. Even within various races, strong individuals often assume human form and maintain it for cultivation. Thus, human features are quite recognizable."

Because the myriad races used the human form as a standard, there was no choice. The powerful races were all humanoid.

Su Yu fell into deep thought. After a while, he said, "What you're saying makes me wonder, were humans, gods, demons, and immortals originally from the same source?"

That was a question for the ages, tracing back to the ancient or even the creation era. In ancient times, races were already distinct, with gods, demons, immortals, and humans.

Su Yu didn't dwell on it. Even if they shared origins, so what? The Ancient Giant Race was said to be a branch of the human race. The Fate Clan and Abyssal Race split in ancient times, also from one lineage. The Control King's lineage was truly a branch of the human race. So what?

Enemies remained enemies.

Su Yu didn't linger on this thought. "Go and arrange a meeting with Marquis Lie Kong. I won't visit the Space Ancient Beast Clan. I'll wait here."

Kong Kong replied solemnly, "Very well. I brought the Beast Emperor's token from the lower realm. Emperor Yu, please wait here. I believe Marquis Lie Kong will agree to meet."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Soon, Kong Kong vanished.

...

In the domain of the Space Ancient Beast Clan, Marquis Lie Kong was busy arranging a migration. Once everything was set, she dismissed the other Daofuse cultivators and unleashed the power of laws. Behind her throne, a small spatial portal appeared.

Marquis Lie Kong stepped through, entering a space that would astonish Su Yu if he saw it. The small space was arranged like a labyrinth, with portals leading to secret realms and dangerous lands, each representing a path of escape.

Of course, it was best if they were never needed. Now, as they planned to migrate to Ren Mountain, should they take these with them? Taking them risked exposure. Most of these portals were fixed, and moving them required a great cost. Not all could be relocated.

"Over ten thousand years... leaving these behind, several Daofuse cultivators paid a great price, exhausting everything, and perished here... Now, should we abandon them?"

There was reluctance. These portals were the clan's foundation. To explore dangerous lands and find safe havens, the Space Ancient Beast Clan had paid dearly. The Iron Devourer Race had few Daofuse cultivators due to suppression. The Space Ancient Beast Clan had few because many had died, even while neutral, mainly to open these passages.

Marquis Lie Kong soon focused on a large portal. This one had cost even more, leading directly to the inner regions of Chaos Mountain. It was secretly opened by a previous quasi-king of the clan who had repeatedly crossed into Chaos Mountain.

Marquis Lie Kong hadn't told anyone. Even if the place was to be besieged, she hadn't revealed it. Otherwise, the myriad races could bypass the outer dangers and directly attack the inner regions, even surrounding the Chaos lineage, striking from behind at a critical moment.

"The three major races aren't good either, nor is the Chaos Race..."

Marquis Lie Kong muttered. None were trustworthy, so why expose her clan's foundation? If a major race targeted the Space Ancient Beast Clan in the future, she'd be prepared, not cutting off her own retreat.

At that moment, she considered secretly sending some young clan members away. But without a Daofuse protector, even an Eternal could manage, but taking a Daofuse would surely be noticed by the myriad races.

In the upper realm, dangerous lands without a Daofuse protector meant certain death.

"I wonder how things are in the lower realm."

Marquis Lie Kong sighed again. She didn't know if the old ones below had led the lower realm to a dead end.

"The lower realm has the Torchbearers, strong in power. The old ones haven't reached the peak of Daofuse, not strong... If they stand against the humans, it's very dangerous! But siding with humans and opposing Tiangu and the others is also extremely dangerous..."

Marquis Lie Kong pondered, recalling the great cost of opening the lower realm's spatial portals, which had ultimately failed, resulting in the deaths of several Daofuse cultivators. It was a regretful matter. Otherwise, connecting the upper and lower realms wouldn't be so difficult.

Everything relied on speculation!

As she thought, her expression suddenly changed. She quickly exited the labyrinth, sealing it with the power of laws. The labyrinth vanished without a trace.

Marquis Lie Kong's eyes turned cold as she swiftly traversed space, disappearing without a ripple.

...

In an ancient city of the Space Ancient Beast Clan, Marquis Lie Kong appeared, looking at an elderly figure... Well, to her, it was just a young space beast.

Her expression changed. "From the lower realm?"

Kong Kong bowed, "Kong Kong from the lower realm greets Marquis Lie Kong."

Seeing the small seal in his hand, her expression changed again. With a wave, they were transported to the grand hall without any spatial disturbance.

Marquis Lie Kong's expression was uncertain. After a moment, she asked, "In the lower realm, you've sided with the humans?"

Kong Kong nodded.

Marquis Lie Kong had guessed as much. Being able to ascend meant he had come with the human powerhouses. Without siding with them, how could they have brought him up?

She took a deep breath, feeling uneasy. "Why lean towards the humans? Our clan has always been neutral!"

Kong Kong replied solemnly, "The humans have a new emperor! The recent events in the upper realm were all orchestrated by the new emperor! He has unified the lower realm, subduing all beings! Tiangu and the others are merely lambs to the slaughter! They haven't been taken down only because the upper realm's passage hasn't opened, so they're sealed within their realms!"

"A new emperor?" Marquis Lie Kong's expression changed. "An emperor?"

"Yes, not just a Human Lord!"

Kong Kong continued, "Before the Beast Emperor left, he instructed me to inform you, even if we don't ally with the new emperor, we mustn't become enemies! The new emperor's rise is unprecedented! The Beast Emperor said... he sees a second Human Emperor!"

Marquis Lie Kong inhaled sharply. "Did the old one really say that?"

"Yes."

Marquis Lie Kong fell silent for a moment. "Did the new emperor send you?"

"Yes, he wishes to meet you..."

"For... the portals?"

Marquis Lie Kong seemed to realize something, her expression changing. The myriad races were about to sweep through, and the new emperor already knew. Not only that, but he had come directly to the Space Ancient Beast Clan, clearly for the portals!

Who told him? Who knew about this?

Kong Kong remained silent.

Marquis Lie Kong asked, "Besides our clan, who else in the lower realm has sided with him?"

"The Fate Clan, Hou Race, and Iron Devourer Race... have all sided with him!"

"The Fate Clan?" Marquis Lie Kong's eyes shifted. "Wuming has sided with him?"

"Yes!"

The Splitting Sky Marquis couldn't sit still any longer. "The Fate Clan, those cunning old foxes, have actually... allied with him?"

Her expression shifted several times before she asked, "Where is he?"

"Just outside the arena."

The Splitting Sky Marquis's face changed again and again. After a moment, she said, "Quickly tell me everything you know so I can make a judgment!"

"Yes!"

Kong Kong swiftly transmitted his thoughts, spreading his willpower to relay everything he knew to the Splitting Sky Marquis. Her expression continued to fluctuate as she processed the information.

A young new emperor! He had subdued the beings of the Lower Realm, fought his way to the Upper Realm, and quickly stirred up a storm there. He even managed to unify the Death Realm! He was creating a new era of glory for the Human Race after the ancient times.

After digesting some of the information, she said heavily, "I will go meet him..."

With that, she looked at Kong Kong. "You come with me!"

"Understood!"

The Splitting Sky Marquis said no more. With a ripple of space, she vanished from her original location. In no time, she appeared with Kong Kong at Su Yu's side.

At that moment, the Splitting Sky Marquis suddenly tightened her grip around Kong Kong's neck.

I'll kill you!

Damn it!

Didn't you say there was only one quasi-king?

You blind fool!

Is this just one?

As far as the eye could see, the entire front row was filled with quasi-kings!

For a moment, she really wanted to strangle Kong Kong to death!

Are you blind?

Is this what you call just one quasi-king?

Idiot!

Not only were there quasi-kings, but there were also quite a few top-tier Daofuse experts. With such strength, if they launched a surprise attack on the Space Ancient Beast Race, they might not even have time to react before being wiped out!

At this moment, the Splitting Sky Marquis was filled with fear.

She had thought that with just one quasi-king, even if she couldn't win, she wouldn't lose. Her teleportation ability was extremely strong.

But now... she was in deep trouble!

The Splitting Sky Marquis squeezed Kong Kong so hard that he was about to roll his eyes, while Kong Kong was left with nothing but helplessness and frustration. What had he done wrong?

I didn't do anything!
