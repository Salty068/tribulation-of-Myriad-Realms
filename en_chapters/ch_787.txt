Chapter 787: Capturing the Heavenly Overseer, Ascending the Path of Life

In the boundless void, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis emerged, not bothering to hide. Today, he was determined to have a life-and-death battle with Su Yu!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu quickly sensed the presence of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and tore through the void to confront him. As the Heavenly Overseer Marquis detected the auras of March and Giant Axe, his expression shifted slightly. "Su Yu, are you planning to ambush me with others?" he asked coldly.

Su Yu hadn't come alone! Were those two Heavenly Sovereigns here to watch the battle, or to join in the ambush?

"Stop right there, both of you!" Su Yu chuckled, signaling March and Giant Axe to halt. It wasn't about following rules; he was worried the Heavenly Overseer Marquis might flee. If he ran, where would Su Yu find him again?

March and Giant Axe exchanged glances but remained silent, quickly stopping in their tracks. There was nothing to worry about! Su Yu had previously dealt with Heavenly Sovereigns with ease. Even if the Heavenly Overseer Marquis had made significant progress, he was unlikely to have reached the level of a Heavenly Sovereign. Even if he had, he would only be at the entry level. Su Yu could handle him without much difficulty.

...

In the endless void, Su Yu arrived alone, tearing through the space. Across from him, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis breathed a slight sigh of relief. Fortunately, Su Yu was playing by the rules. If there had been more people, he would have had to flee; he wasn't about to walk into a death trap.

At this moment, Su Yu also looked at the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. Clad in white like snow... Seeing someone in white these days annoyed Su Yu. Everyone seemed to be dressing like scholars.

"Su Yu, since you're here, let's have a life-and-death battle. No matter who wins, in this world, there might be..."

Boom!

Before the Heavenly Overseer Marquis could finish his sentence, Su Yu's hand covered the sky, and the Five Elemental Cage erupted! The cage instantly shattered the void, trapping the Heavenly Overseer Marquis from all directions!

He wasn't a Heavenly Sovereign, Su Yu could tell. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis had made progress, likely reaching the pinnacle of the Heavenly King level, which was quite formidable. Previously, he had only been at the second-tier Daofuse Realm, and now he seemed close to becoming a Heavenly Sovereign.

This level of strength would be challenging for most to deal with. But he was facing the current Su Yu.

Nowadays, Su Yu might not be able to take on ten Heavenly Sovereigns at once, but he could certainly handle two or three. A single Heavenly Sovereign could easily take on two or three Heavenly Kings. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis, as a Heavenly King, was no match for Su Yu!

Moreover, Su Yu had numerous techniques at his disposal.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis's power of destiny erupted instantly, but Su Yu's own power of destiny surged even stronger. Competing in destiny?

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis represented the ancient destiny, true, and the ancient era was powerful, but he could only represent the ancient destiny of the current Myriad Realms. Su Yu, having opened the heavens, fused over a hundred Daos, and subdued numerous powerful beings, including many Heavenly Sovereigns, had a destiny that was unmatched.

Competing in destiny, could you really surpass me?

The power of destiny erupted instantly! Moreover, part of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's destiny was provided by Su Yu.

At this moment, Su Yu's power of destiny exploded, and he chuckled, "Playing with destiny? You're not even a match! Fall!"

Bang!

A fall on flat ground!

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis stumbled, shocked. How could this be?

"Fall into the cage!"

With a rumbling sound, a spatial fluctuation occurred, and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis instinctively dodged, but with a bang, he fell into the Five Elemental Cage.

Inside the cage, hundreds of chains descended, enveloping him. In the blink of an eye, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis was bound.

His eyes widened in disbelief. Impossible! How could this be? He erupted with a powerful aura, and hundreds of divine characters appeared instantly.

"All paths return to me!"

As his hundreds of divine characters appeared, Su Yu's body emitted hundreds of strands of Dao power, instantly suppressing the divine characters!

Su Yu traversed the space, appearing before the Heavenly Overseer Marquis in an instant, pressing down with one hand. With a bang, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis was sent flying.

Simultaneously, within the cage, tens of thousands of chains appeared, binding the Heavenly Overseer Marquis tightly from all directions. The cage then shrank, transforming into the size of a bowl.

Su Yu reached out and grabbed the cage. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis had also shrunk, struggling fiercely inside, roaring, "Impossible!"

Even a Heavenly Sovereign would find it difficult to capture him. After all, he was the embodiment of destiny! In battle, his opponents were bound to suffer misfortune, and it wasn't uncommon for them to miss their attacks or even be counter-killed!

Such was the allure of the path of destiny!

Su Yu couldn't be bothered. Competing in destiny, he was suppressed. Competing in strength, he was crushed. What was there to compete with?

Nothing at all!

Having subdued the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, Su Yu sealed the entire cage, preventing any sound from escaping. Then, he reached out and grabbed Duobao. "You go in too, keep him company and stop him from struggling. I'm protecting him right now!"

Duobao bared his teeth, unable to refuse, and nodded, soon being sent into the cage by Su Yu. Fine, I'll go in and chat with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis!

It was terrifying!

Duobao was utterly shocked. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis had always seemed invincible to him. Even with the emergence of many Heavenly Sovereigns, Duobao believed that the Heavenly Overseer Marquis could still hold his own against them.

Destiny was such a mysterious thing. In battle, even if you were stronger than the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, you might still be counter-killed if your destiny couldn't suppress his!

Yet Su Yu remained calm.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis was no match for him; that was inevitable.

Destiny? This thing had no numerical value. Truth be told, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's destiny was nowhere near Su Yu's. Ancient destiny? Nonsense!

In ancient times, the destinies of the Culture King, Time Sage, and Human Emperor might all be with Su Yu, including those of the Radiant King and Hundred Battle King, because their descendants were all on Su Yu's side.

Destiny was a very subjective thing.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis, claiming to represent the ancient era, could only represent those who had died. Those who hadn't died were either with Su Yu or with Hundred Battle!

Just as Su Yu captured the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, a powerful aura surged forth.

It wasn't Hundred Battle!

In the distance, a massive figure appeared—it was Thunderstorm.

At this moment, Thunderstorm scanned the area, but before he could see Su Yu, March and Giant Axe blocked his path. Just as Thunderstorm was about to speak, Su Yu's voice rang out, "Tongtian, let's go!"

Three portals appeared before Su Yu and the others. In the next moment, March and Giant Axe exchanged glances, said nothing, and stepped into the portals. Instantly, the three of them, along with Tongtian, vanished from the scene!

Thunderstorm's expression changed slightly, then he frowned, looking towards the endless void.

Where was the Heavenly Overseer Marquis?

He hadn't seen March and Giant Axe make a move. There had only been a slight disturbance here a moment ago. Where had the Heavenly Overseer Marquis gone?

He hadn't even seen Su Yu!

Thunderstorm frowned deeply, suddenly looking in a certain direction!

There lay the Immortal Realm.

Su Yu appeared once more!

At this moment, Su Yu's voice boomed like thunder, echoing through the heavens, "Tiangu, Jiwu, Demon Halberd! Prepare yourselves, the strong of the three realms, to ascend to the Upper Realm with me! March and Giant Axe have reached an agreement with the strong of your three tribes. Ascend to aid the myriad races! The enmity between us can be settled later!"

Upon hearing this, Thunderstorm was taken aback.

Was he really sending them up?

That wasn't the key point. The key was that Su Yu had directly spoken on behalf of March and Giant Axe. This... wasn't this openly declaring that March and Giant Axe were his people?

Previously, even if the myriad races had speculated, they hadn't confirmed it, nor had they broken this unspoken understanding.

But now, Su Yu had outright stated it.

Thunderstorm frowned.

Then Su Yu's voice rang out again, "In three days, I'll come to pick you up!"

At this moment, from the Immortal Realm, Tiangu's voice echoed, "Are you also going to the Upper Realm?"

Su Yu replied coldly, "Naturally! I suffered a defeat in the Upper Realm once. I've roamed the Myriad Realms, invincible, and no one can make me taste defeat, no one! The Control King's lineage is treacherous and rebellious. If I can kill him, can they dare to kill me? Such audacity deserves the extermination of their entire clan! Tiangu, prepare yourselves. In three days, I'll come to pick you up. Decide how many will go. If you don't go, you might not get another chance!"

At that moment, from the Divine Realm, a weak fluctuation of willpower came, and the voice of the former Empress echoed, "Is Emperor Yu planning to discuss cooperation with the myriad races?"

Su Yu turned his head towards the Divine Realm, "Is the Empress about to perish? I see your destiny dissipating, your Dao power in disarray. Are you about to die?"

"Living long enough, there's always a time to die."

The former Empress was indeed on the brink of death. She had been barely holding on, and now, to empower Jiwu and the others, she had directly infused them with Dao power, leaving her hanging by a thread!

Su Yu chuckled, "If you're going to die, it's best to die in the Upper Realm! Otherwise, those old things in the Upper Realm might think I killed you in the Lower Realm! Of course, I don't fear their misunderstanding, but given your esteemed status, if you truly die in the Lower Realm, the Divine Race in the Upper Realm might turn against me! Those Sunmoon Heavenly Sovereigns are not weak! Empress, you should hang on. Whether you die or not isn't up to me!"

Su Yu's demeanor was extraordinary, reflecting across the heavens, hands clasped behind his back, he said indifferently, "If the Empress thinks it's fine to die in the Lower Realm, and the Divine Race turns against me, and I kill the Sunmoon Heavenly Sovereigns, don't blame me for being ruthless. It would only mean the Divine Race is courting death. Empress, decide whether to ascend or not!"

Arrogant!

He wouldn't even let her die.

Because if the Empress died, and the Divine Race thought Su Yu killed her, and turned against him, according to Su Yu, the ones to die would be the Sunmoon Heavenly Sovereigns. Even March and Giant Axe felt this was a bit too arrogant!

However, after a moment of silence, the Divine Realm echoed with the weak voice of the former Empress, "Then I... shall go to the Upper Realm to die!"

Yes, the former Empress conceded.

Only those powerful beings in the lower realm could truly comprehend the terror that was Su Yu. His strength might not be the greatest, but he was invincible, overcoming every obstacle. Whenever he faced a crisis, he would always find a way to turn the tide!

He always managed to reverse the situation!

While the Fate Emperor and others in the upper realm hesitated, the lower realm had already chosen Su Yu. Su Yu was simply too miraculous! Even with Hundred Battle's return, even with his formidable strength, including Tiangu, they were more afraid of Su Yu, who had fled to the Death Realm.

Because he was the one who, right under their noses, had gradually overturned the Myriad Realms.

From the Skysoar Realm, when Sunmoon experts came to kill him, to when Daofuse experts came to kill him, Su Yu not only survived but grew stronger with each battle!

He was too legendary!

So legendary that even Tiangu and the former empress would rather face Hundred Battle than Su Yu!

...

March and Giant Axe exchanged a peculiar glance.

No one doubted it?

Su Yu said it, and you all believe it?

He said he would take you to the upper realm, and you believe it?

As they pondered this, a voice from afar, belonging to Demon Halberd, echoed, "Su Yu, are you taking the Fate Clan's passage to the upper realm?"

"No!"

Su Yu replied calmly, "We'll take the Torchbearer's passage!"

"Is there a limit on numbers?"

Su Yu sneered, "If you have the ability to pack the entire Devil Realm and take it up, I won't stop you!"

Demon Halberd had nothing to say.

From the Divine Realm, Jiwu's voice also echoed, "Do we need to seal ourselves?"

"No need!"

Su Yu replied indifferently, "Behave yourselves. There's no need for you to seal yourselves. If you cause trouble, I'll just kill you all! If you think you can handle me without relying on the upper realm's power, feel free to try!"

The three realms fell silent.

No one had such thoughts!

That meant Su Yu really intended to take them up.

At this moment, from the Dragon Realm, an Eternal voice, somewhat hoarse, called out, "Can our Dragon Clan go?"

Su Yu looked towards the Dragon Realm. Most of the Dragon Realm's experts had been killed by him, and the Heavenly Dragon Marquis had fled to the upper realm, the only surviving Daofuse expert. The current Dragon Clan was extremely weak in the lower realm.

Su Yu replied coldly, "If you want to go, you can. If you're not afraid of dying, not afraid of becoming cannon fodder in the upper realm, then go ahead! The current Myriad Realms is actually safer for weaklings like you. If you want to be cannon fodder, I'll fulfill your wish! Any clan with a Heavenly Sovereign can send people! The three major clans, plus the Nether, Dragon, Phoenix, and Fate clans can all go! As for the Giant Clan, see what Thunderstorm thinks. Thunderstorm has descended to the lower realm, so whether you go or not is up to you!"

"Three days later, meet me in the Endless Void!"

Su Yu's voice boomed across the Myriad Realms, "I am not a babysitter for the weak. If you want to take the passage, go by yourselves. If you die, don't blame me. Except for the former empress, who is hard to kill, the rest of you can die as much as you like!"

The Myriad Realms fell silent!

Today, it was still Su Yu's day.

When Hundred Battle chose to keep a low profile, his deterrence in the Myriad Realms was far less than Su Yu's!

Unparalleled dominance!

He decided who could go and who must go!

As for whether he was deceiving them... it seemed... unnecessary.

If Su Yu truly had the ability to destroy them, he wouldn't need to deceive them. Gathering them would be a hassle; it would be better to attack one realm at a time!

Gathering them together would only make them stronger!

...

In the Human Realm.

Hundred Battle remained silent, but Wuji couldn't help but mutter, "Your Majesty, this Su Yu is quite arrogant! If he takes these people away, then... what about us..."

The experts of the three major clans were essentially their hostages.

If Su Yu took them all to the upper realm, what then?

However, Changqing spoke softly, "It might not be a bad thing. Everyone heard Thunderstorm's words. If they go to the upper realm, the upper realm won't bother with the lower realm for now. Otherwise, the myriad races would still worry about these people causing trouble, and their attention would never leave us!"

He hesitated, "Is Su Yu going to the upper realm?"

He had just arrived in the lower realm to lie low, and now he was planning to go to the upper realm for revenge?

Not far away, Changmei said calmly, "It's not hard to understand. The arrival of March and Giant Axe gave him confidence! With two Heavenly Sovereign-level experts, plus the dog of the Culture King on his side, that's three Heavenly Sovereign-level beings. He thinks he can secure a place in the upper realm!"

He sneered, "I said before that he would eventually collude with the myriad races. Blood Shadow and Red Moon didn't believe me and defended him... and now? He openly says he's going to the upper realm to discuss cooperation with the myriad races!"

Su Yu himself said so!

How can you defend that?

Blood Shadow and Red Moon ignored him, but they were somewhat solemn. Su Yu was going to the upper realm?

The upper realm was not peaceful now.

It was a very unwise idea!

They didn't know what Su Yu was thinking. Since he had hidden in the Death Realm, why expose himself now?

Even if Giant Axe and March supported him, how much support could they provide?

In the upper realm, would the myriad races really treat him as a partner?

More like cannon fodder!

Everyone knew how many experts from the myriad races Su Yu had killed in the lower realm. He had also killed many experts from the three major clans in the upper realm, not to mention almost wiping out the Daofuse experts of the Dragon Clan!

With such enmity, could Su Yu have a good outcome in the upper realm?

Hundred Battle watched for a while and said calmly, "Let him be."

If Su Yu wanted to go up, he wouldn't stop him.

Changqing spoke softly, "What is Giant Axe thinking?"

Su Yu didn't say, but Giant Axe followed him. This time, he didn't even return to the Human Realm but went straight to find Su Yu. Now he's escorting Su Yu to the upper realm. What is Giant Axe thinking?

"Giant Axe values loyalty. Su Yu saved him, so it's normal for him to follow Su Yu."

Hundred Battle didn't say much. Giant Axe had always been like this.

This time, Su Yu saved him, so it's not surprising that he followed Su Yu.

But March, this time, Su Yu almost made it clear that March was following him, which was unexpected. Wasn't March worried about the consequences?

The Iron Devourer Race wasn't stupid. If they were, they would have been wiped out long ago.

...

Su Yu didn't care what the Human Realm thought.

He was certain that Hundred Battle wouldn't show himself now.

They had finally gone into hiding, so why expose themselves now?

Since Su Yu had stepped forward, let him handle it.

Not only that, but at this moment, Thunderstorm suddenly said, "Emperor Yu, when we reach the upper realm, please take care of us!"

Su Yu turned his head to look over there.

He laughed!

What was this?

Trying to divert Hundred Battle's attention?

With those words, it seemed like Thunderstorm was also one of his people.

Su Yu laughed and nodded, "Don't worry, I'll take good care of you!"

If I don't provoke you, don't think you can pin the blame on me. If you, Thunderstorm, really want to play tricks with me, I can outplay you.

Soon, Su Yu stopped talking.

I'm busy, no time to deal with you.

"Tongtian!"

The portal opened by Marquis Tongtian activated once more. This time, Su Yu entered alone, leaving March and Giant Axe behind. Su Yu instructed, "You two keep an eye out, we'll meet in three days!"

The two nodded.

They watched Su Yu leave.

Once Su Yu was gone, Thunderstorm arrived, asking in a deep voice, "Where is the Heavenly Overseer?"

March glanced at him and chuckled, "Ran away. Seeing so many of us, he ran faster than anyone!"

Ran away?

Thunderstorm wasn't sure. He had arrived quickly, but when he got there, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis was already gone.

Did he run, or was he captured?

He couldn't tell!

He looked at March again and asked in a deep voice, "You two, Giant Axe aside, but March... are you really going to the upper realm with Su Yu?"

For the Iron Devourer Race, that would mean taking a clear stand!

Previously, the Iron Devourer Race's stance was unclear, but now, with Su Yu openly discussing this matter in front of the Myriad Realms, it might not be a good thing for the Iron Devourer Race.

March laughed, "Going up together! I actually want to try and see if I can get my clansmen back!"

He smiled, "Teaming up with Giant Axe and Fat Ball, we have three Heavenly Sovereigns. If the Sun Corona and others don't want to tear their faces, I think there's still hope! Why not join us, Thunderstorm? Maybe we can have a better chance?"

Thunderstorm quickly thought it over and laughed, "Forget it, I'm better off in the dark than in the open. I'll support you, March, but if you truly leave the myriad races' camp, you'll lack some intelligence. Let me be the middleman!"

"Ha, alright!"

March sneered inwardly. Of course, Thunderstorm wouldn't choose to openly side with Su Yu. If Su Yu got into trouble, he'd be in a bind.

He's one of Hundred Battle's people, silently lurking in the myriad races' camp.

As for the myriad races' experts suspecting him, so what?

March calculated and didn't mind. This time going to the upper realm, there was still a good chance to negotiate with the myriad races and get his clansmen back, which would reduce many concerns!

As for danger, that would only come if Su Yu was defeated.

But others might not know, March certainly knew Su Yu's strength.

Very terrifying!

In that new world, so many powerful beings, and now, apart from Su Yu's side, no one in the Myriad Realms knew. This was a force capable of overturning the Myriad Realms.

...

Su Yu left, and the three major clans began preparing to ascend to the upper realm.

At this moment, they were also thinking about leaving if they could.

If they didn't leave, the lower realm was indeed becoming more dangerous.

With Hundred Battle here, and Su Yu occasionally appearing, and now, the upper realm seemed to be at war, they might not have the chance to intervene. If they didn't go to the upper realm, something would happen sooner or later.

In the Immortal Realm.

Tiangu was ordering people to pack some things while pondering. After a long time, he suddenly said, "He made such a big fuss to find the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, and then suddenly left. Talisman King, where do you think the Heavenly Overseer went?"

Talisman King wondered, "Ran away?"

Ran away?

Tiangu fell into deep thought. Ran away, and Su Yu just let it go?

He made such a big commotion, was Su Yu the type to let things slide?

Probably not!

He vaguely had some suspicions and, after a long time, said, "Maybe... the Heavenly Overseer was captured!"

Talisman King was shocked, "Impossible, right? I saw that March and Giant Axe didn't seem to make a move!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis wasn't weak!

In a brief moment, with just a few words exchanged, had Su Yu really captured him alone? Tiangu was uncertain, but he suspected that the Heavenly Overseer Marquis had indeed been captured. At this moment, he felt a headache coming on.

Quickly, he said, "Forget it, let's discuss this when we reach the Upper Realm!"

After a brief pause, Tiangu continued, "Once we reach the Upper Realm, the Immortal Clan is currently under the control of Dao and Desolate, correct?"

"Yes."

Tiangu fell silent for a moment, then smiled, "Forget it, let's go and see!"

He was the king of the Immortal Clan, but he had been in the Lower Realm for too long. Some of the powerful figures in the Upper Realm might not listen to him anymore, even if he had stepped into the realm of a Heavenly King. In the Upper Realm, he might not have enough authority.

Going to the Upper Realm was not something he wanted to do unless absolutely necessary.

"Very well!"

Tiangu chuckled, "Once we reach the Upper Realm, the Great Dao is even more ethereal. Perhaps I will make progress quickly!"

Without further ado, he left quietly.

Leaving now, there might be no return. Today, he would take a good look at the Immortal Realm he had ruled for a hundred thousand years. This time, if Su Yu didn't go up, it would be fine. But if Su Yu went, could he really stay idle? Perhaps a great war would soon erupt in the Upper Realm.

As for himself, if he were to die, it would either be at the hands of Su Yu or the lineage of the Control King. There was really no hope of returning to the Lower Realm.

In his heart, there was a sense of despair and foreboding.

But he didn't voice it, for even if he did, who would believe him?

...

Su Yu was busy, having settled the affairs of the Myriad Realms, he returned to the Death Realm to continue his work.

...

Meanwhile, in the River of Time, a figure moved against the current.

Xingyue didn't know how long she had been moving upstream, until the life force beneath her feet was about to completely dissipate! Even the Xingyu Imprint had lost its brilliance.

Xingyue looked ahead, wondering if she had arrived yet. If not for the Xingyu Imprint and the abundant life force she had just regained, she might not have had any hope of making it this far.

"Am I not there yet?"

She was anxious. If she didn't reach her destination soon, she would have to go with the flow.

Just as she was thinking this, she suddenly seemed to cross a boundary.

At that moment, her aura changed dramatically. In an instant, a rich and boundless life force spread out, and Xingyue was stunned. Looking back, it seemed she had pierced through a thin membrane!

"Did I... pass through the blockade?"

Her aura grew stronger, much stronger than before. In an instant, an overwhelming life force surged beneath her feet. She had become the master of the Great Dao!

Yes, she had advanced!

Or rather, she had recovered.

A master of the rules!

Xingyue was slightly dazed. So, her brother had only sealed off a section of the area. Indeed, if he had the power to seal the entire River of Time, the Human Emperor would have long been on par with the Master of Time!

"In other words, if a strong individual from downstream could pass through this sealed area, they could also break through?"

Upon careful thought, it was extremely difficult!

She had previously reached her limit, aided by the power of resurrection and the Xingyu Imprint. If she weren't a master of the rules, she probably couldn't have come here. If she weren't, it wouldn't have made a difference whether she came or not!

The section sealed by the Human Emperor was just right!

Those below the master of the rules couldn't come, and those who did would face the same outcome.

At this moment, Xingyue, having regained her strength, found her aura still slowly growing. During her resurrection, she had fused with her origin, and her strength had progressed significantly.

"The Dao of Life and Death?"

She had only mastered the Dao of Life, but at this moment, there was a faint death aura emanating from her. Having been a death spirit for many years, she had fused half of the origin of life and death, and later, Su Yu's Dao of Life and Death.

At this moment, the power of life and death coexisted within her.

At this moment, as she once again mastered the Great Dao of Life, Xingyue hesitated slightly. Her body was filled with the power of life, far greater than the power of death, as she had effectively mastered two Great Daos of Life.

"The Dao of Death in the River of Time has long been extracted by the Lord of the Dead Spirits, so it no longer exists in the River of Time!"

Therefore, at this moment, the power of life was indeed strong, while the power of death was somewhat lacking.

Unless, life and death were converted.

Transforming the power of life into the power of death.

"And which Great Dao of Life should be strengthened by the power of life?"

She had two!

After some thought, she extracted a significant amount of the power of the Great Dao of Life from the River of Time and suddenly integrated it into the two Great Daos within her, particularly the white one.

Let's try strengthening Su Yu's Great Dao of Life!

She was the first true master of the rules in Su Yu's world, in the truest sense, because she had long been a master of the rules by mastering the Great Dao of Life. At this moment, having regained her realm, she instantly mastered Su Yu's Great Dao of Life, and even the Death Dao, which she also mastered.

Having been a death spirit for so many years!

For most, mastering it would easily turn them into death spirits in Su Yu's world, but Xingyue had no such problem, as the power of life always suppressed the power of death.

At this moment, as she recovered, she actually mastered three Great Daos simultaneously.

Of course, two of them were somewhat weak, and compared to the Great Dao in the River of Time, the gap was still quite significant. The two were extremely important Great Daos, and even when fused together, they barely matched the power of a single Great Dao.

The Great Dao of Life and Death, this was a fundamental Great Dao, each one incredibly powerful, let alone two. Now that they were fused, they still felt weaker than her Great Dao of Life.

Xingyue calculated that Su Yu's world was still too weak!

"The Great Dao of Life and Death is with me. If I strengthen the Dao of Life and Death, his world should also expand..."

Xingyue, as the master of the Great Dao, quickly extracted some of the life force from the River of Time and integrated it into Su Yu's Great Dao. For her, it didn't have much impact, but doing so would create some bias.

...

And at this moment.

Su Yu had just returned to his own world, and the next moment, he raised an eyebrow. This small world suddenly expanded again, and this time, it expanded quickly and significantly!

A rich life force erupted throughout the entire world!

Wan Tiansheng quickly flew over, looking at this world, then at Su Yu, with some surprise, "It's expanding! And it feels faster than when the South King was resurrected and fused with the Dao!"

Su Yu nodded, "Someone has become a true master of the rules!"

Wan Tiansheng understood, Xingyue!

She had become a master of the rules, the master of the rules in Su Yu's world.

This also meant that Xingyue had instantly truly mastered the power of the Great Dao of Life and Death, perfecting life and death. At this moment, the world, originally the size of a small town, expanded rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, it had reached the size of Nanyuan City!

Not only that, at this moment, Su Yu looked up at the sky, and he could see something. A large amount of life force was still being integrated, and throughout the world, the death aura was almost completely suppressed. The powerful life force made Su Yu feel as if his vitality had been restored significantly, and he was becoming younger.

Even his white hair showed signs of turning black.

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, quickly realizing that an external life force had been integrated into his Great Dao of Life!

Xingyue had advanced, not only advancing in her own world but also mastering the Great Dao of Life in the River of Time. At this moment, she had integrated some of her Great Dao power into Su Yu's Great Dao of Life.

Wan Tiansheng watched for a while, actually deducing the situation, and laughed, "It seems she has advanced to a master of the rules, and the Myriad Realms are quiet. Does this mean she has already reached the Human Emperor's side?"

"Probably soon!"

Wan Tiansheng calculated, "It's been quite a while, moving against the current in the River of Time for over a day. Even with the Xingyu Imprint, it would take three days otherwise. This means that non-masters of the rules almost can't make it across!"

Su Yu nodded, "Certainly, if it were that simple, someone would have crossed long ago! Over a day..."

Su Yu thought for a moment, "If the time flow is fast, maybe in a year or two, the Human Emperor and the others will have to return!"

Of course, this was just his own judgment.

He watched for a while longer, then stopped worrying about it. It was a good thing, and besides, he couldn't do anything about it. At this moment, Xingyue wasn't here, and even if he spoke, she wouldn't hear.

Su Yu quickly walked to the edge of the world, and soon, a large seal appeared.

The seal opened automatically!

Su Yu glanced at it. Inside the seal were the sources of all paths, and at this moment, there were still some of Lantian's avatars, seemingly connecting to the power of the myriad paths in the River of Time.

Inside the seal, it seemed like a central control center.

Su Yu took out a cage, which returned to its normal size. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis was talking to Duobao. When the cage appeared, he looked around, startled. What was this place?

Here, he couldn't even sense the power of the Myriad Realms' fortune!

Su Yu didn't explain, looking at him, he directly said, "Stay here, don't think about escaping, you can't escape!"

"This is the core of my world. If you can escape, I'll consider you impressive!"

After saying this, Su Yu quickly added, "I have other matters to attend to. You can comprehend the Dao of Fortune in my world, but..."

Su Yu coldly said, "You are not allowed to integrate into my Dao of Fortune, otherwise, I'll kill you!"

If this guy integrated, he would draw away the power of fortune from the Myriad Realms, causing great trouble. The seal would break, and that was not the outcome Su Yu wanted.

Of course, without his permission, it would be difficult for the Heavenly Overseer Marquis to integrate even if he wanted to.

Su Yu continued, "However, you can comprehend it and leave your insights here! Rest assured, I won't kill you. Why would I kill you?"

Su Yu smiled faintly, "You are my key protection target. If you die, wouldn't I be even more troubled? Heavenly Overseer Marquis, enjoy my protection here!"

At this moment, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis didn't know what to say, only feeling despondent. Was the gap between him and Su Yu growing larger?

The core of the world, connected to what Duobao had just said, he already knew what this place was.

Su Yu had opened his own world!

He was breaking free from the constraints of the Myriad Realms!

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis remained silent for a moment before speaking, "Even if you control me, it won't matter. Once the fortune of the Myriad Realms dissipates, I will die, and everyone else will still advance!"

Su Yu squinted his eyes and smiled, "True, but... that's something far in the future. Do you think I will need that long to deal with my opponents?"

Alright, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis thought for a moment. Perhaps he really wouldn't need that long. This guy was becoming increasingly terrifying!
