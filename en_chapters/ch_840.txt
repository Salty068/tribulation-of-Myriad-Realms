Chapter 840: The Hypocritical Smile

At this moment, Su Yu and the Human Emperor were engaged in a lively conversation... or so it seemed!

Su Yu still had many questions he wanted to ask, but he decided there was no rush. There was no need to ask everything right now. He quickly shifted back to the main topic. "Now that we're coming from the rear, once the Myriad Races at the front line discover our presence... it would essentially give them a chance to unite against us! Your Majesty, do you have any plans to deal with them?"

After so many years of confrontation, Su Yu didn't believe there were no strategies in place.

Since the Human Emperor had long prepared for reinforcements from the rear, what about now?

At this moment, the Human Emperor suddenly sighed. "If I were still in my prime, I would simply force my way through! By killing a few first-class rulers of laws, naturally, some among the Myriad Races would become cowardly... not everyone is unafraid of death! In that case, dealing with them would be simple!"

Unfortunately, that was not the case now.

The Human Emperor continued, "When fighting the Myriad Races, we can't go too far. Otherwise, if they decide to fight to the death, we won't have time to develop further. Once the Three Gates open... we're doomed!"

The losses can't be too great!

Over 80 rulers of laws on our side, against more than 120 on theirs, totaling over 200 rulers of laws. Even if the human race wins, it would be a pyrrhic victory.

If only a dozen or so rulers of laws remain, once the Three Gates open... we're finished!

There are quite a few powerful beings within the Three Gates.

The ones gathered here now are remnants from the ancient, archaic, and New Era of Xingyu periods. To be more precise, they are strong individuals from a single era!

How many powerful beings are there within the Three Gates?

Thinking of this, Su Yu asked, "What era is sealed within the Human Gate? I know the Heaven Gate is from the Era of Creation, and the Earth Gate is from the Chaos Era. But I'm curious, what era does the Human Gate seal?"

Indeed, Su Yu was curious about this!

The Human Gate seemed to have some connection with the Human Ancestor, but it also appeared to be related to the Master of Time. This Human Gate might be one end of the River of Time.

"The Human Gate..."

The Human Emperor was silent for a moment, pondering before explaining to Su Yu, "The Master of Time was powerful during the Chaos Era. There's no doubt about that, right?"

Su Yu nodded. Of course, there was no doubt!

"Just like you, powerful in this era... let me ask you, if you became powerful, would you seal your own era?"

Su Yu was taken aback. No, he wouldn't, right?

If I became powerful, why would I seal my own era?

His eyes flickered.

The Human Emperor smiled. "That's exactly the point! The Human Gate should be the beginning part of the Master of Time's Dao when the heavens were first opened. So, it seals the era above the Master of Time! The era before Chaos!"

Su Yu inhaled sharply. "Then... how did Hundred Battle and the others end up in the Human Gate?"

"It's related to the Human Ancestor. The Human Ancestor might have visited the Human Gate."

The Human Emperor indeed knew a lot. He smiled and said, "The cycle of the Myriad Realms, in fact, the era sealed within the Human Gate should also be a glorious era. This might be the first era! And the Master of Time should originate from that era but became powerful during the Chaos Era!"

"His Time Dao was developed, but for what purpose, I don't know. However, one end is the Human Gate, the other is the Heaven Gate, and the Earth Gate is sealed in between... don't you think the Master of Time's Dao is more like a seal?"

Su Yu's heart trembled!

The Human Emperor continued to smile. "Yes, it's a seal! The Master of Time opened the Dao, possibly to seal these. As for the Era of Creation being sealed within the Heaven Gate, during the Heaven Gate period, the Master of Time should have long disappeared... but whether he truly disappeared or not, who knows?"

"And the development of the Myriad Realms, allowing people to cultivate, is merely to strengthen the seal. The more cultivators in the Myriad Realms, the stronger the seal!"

The Human Emperor spoke softly. "We are all strengthening the River of Time! Enhancing the sealing power! Logically, the seal should only grow stronger, not weaker. But now, with the Three Gates about to open... perhaps some changes have occurred! Maybe someone is deliberately weakening the power of the River of Time!"

Hearing this, Su Yu's eyes flickered. "Does Your Majesty know about the Three Body Method?"

"The Three Body Method..."

The Human Emperor was silent for a moment. "Have you figured it out?"

"Yes!"

The Human Emperor gave a self-deprecating smile. "That should be one of the methods! Someone spread the Three Body Method, actually to weaken the River of Time, but I suppressed it before!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. The Human Emperor... suppressed the Three Body Method!

The Human Emperor seemed to guess that Su Yu might have used it, sighing, "When we extract from the source, we become stronger, but the River of Time is weakened... Of course, it doesn't matter now. Since the Three Gates are about to open, extract if you must!"

He sighed. "Moreover, you weren't the first to do it. I also extracted the source of the Three Bodies!"

He said helplessly, "Initially, I realized there were some issues after extracting... so, during that period, I sealed the Three Body Method! But at that time, the Three Body Method was still spread out. Unless all those strong individuals were killed, it was hard to prohibit it!"

"Where did the Three Body Method originate from?"

Su Yu was puzzled. According to the Human Emperor, he knew of the Three Body Method's existence and even knew its drawbacks. Indeed, this Human Emperor was truly omniscient, or rather, he was aware of all the information Su Yu had obtained.

A terrifying existence!

So terrifying, yet he was still nearly destroyed by someone. It shows that the mastermind behind the scenes is not weak either.

The Three Body Method must have been spread from within the Three Gates!

Sure enough, the Human Emperor said, "The Three Body Method... was definitely spread from within the Three Gates! As for who spread it, I don't know. It's hard to trace. It existed before my time! During my era, I minimized the impact of the Three Body Method, but in your era... it might have revived!"

Su Yu nodded. "Not only did it revive, but by the sixth tide, the Three Body Method had become mainstream. If you didn't follow the Three Body Path, you'd be obliterated by the rules!"

The Human Emperor's eyes flickered. "Obliterated by the rules? Xingyue didn't mention this... so... after the sixth tide, someone might have altered some rules of the Myriad Realms..."

"The sixth tide..."

He calculated and thought for a moment. "Did anything special happen?"

Su Yu shook his head. He really didn't know, but he quickly looked at the group of people over there. Maybe they knew. Su Yu called out, "Destiny, come here!"

Compared to others, Destiny had never been dormant, so he might know more.

Soon, Marquis Destiny flew over, slightly bowing to the Human Emperor, then looking at Su Yu, speaking softly, "Your Majesty!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "During the sixth tide, did any changes occur?"

"Changes?"

Marquis Destiny thought for a moment, then said, "During the sixth tide, there were indeed some changes! First, after the sixth tide, the Hunting Pavilion was no longer aligned with the human race, and the Monitor of Heaven chose neutrality!"

"Second, the Human Lord of the sixth tide was very powerful. He defeated the Myriad Races, and although not as strong as Your Majesty, he was a Heavenly Venerable level existence, even a fifth-class ruler of laws. But later, after the human race won, he fell during his breakthrough, causing the sixth tide to end prematurely!"

"Third, towards the end of the sixth tide, the sixth generation Human Lord appeared less frequently. He didn't rush to deal with the Myriad Races but instead focused on his own closed-door cultivation. I'm not sure if that's considered strange?"

Besides these, he thought carefully and couldn't recall any other changes.

The Human Emperor spoke softly, "Destiny, did the Human Lord of the sixth tide open the Three Gates?"

"Hmm?"

Marquis Destiny thought for a moment, then shook his head. "Your Majesty, I truly don't know. After all, I'm not of the human race."

Indeed.

As for the human race... they might not know either.

Su Yu waved his hand. "Alright, I understand. You may go back!"

"Your servant takes his leave!"

Marquis Destiny quickly departed, and the Human Emperor spoke softly, "The sixth generation Human Lord... might have opened the Three Gates, causing some changes, allowing beings from within the Three Gates to emerge and kill him! Thus altering some rules, leading to the sixth tide primarily following the Three Body Method!"

The Human Emperor smiled and said, "So, the timing for the Three Gates to open might have been advanced! Otherwise, it might have been delayed!"

With just a few simple words, he made a deduction and continued, "The beings that emerged from the Three Gates are probably not weak, possibly stronger than Zhou Tian. Otherwise, Zhou Tian should know something. Since he didn't mention it to you, he might not know either."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "That can't be said for sure. That guy tells me 99 lies for every truth! Your Majesty chose a good leader for the secret guards, recognizing no one but the Human Emperor!"

The Human Emperor laughed.

He didn't dwell on this matter, continuing, "The beings within the Three Gates want the Three Body Method to spread, but we... actually also hope the Three Body Method can strengthen us. It's an unavoidable situation!"

Su Yu nodded. The Three Body Method still had its benefits!

Moreover, it didn't consume many resources, mainly because of the power of the source, which could save resources and directly enhance the source, seemingly consuming little, but actually consuming the power of the source.

It consumed the power of the River of Time!

And the Human Emperor defined the River of Time as a seal, sealing the existence of the Three Gates. Countless people cultivating was to strengthen this seal.

So, is the Human Gate stronger, or is the existence within the Heaven Gate stronger?

What is the Human Ancestor's stance?

Thinking of this, Su Yu continued, "Your Majesty, I heard that back then, the Control King wanted to open the Earth Gate to release the Human Ancestor, but Your Majesty refused. Is that true? Has the Human Ancestor changed his mind?"

"The Human Ancestor?"

The Human Emperor smiled and said, "The Prison... it's difficult to discuss! Releasing the Human Ancestor might not necessarily be a bad thing, but it's not the right time! Opening the Earth Gate could lead to all Three Gates being opened, and that wouldn't be the right time for it!"

"Doesn't the Prison know about this?"

Su Yu asked solemnly, "Why did he betray us?"

As one of the Four Extremes Human Kings, knowing the dangers of opening the Three Gates, why insist on it? Why even betray us for it? Could the Human Ancestor be that important to him? That's absurd!

The Control King was one of the Four Extremes Human Kings, possibly at the second-class peak or even first-class by then. Would such a powerful figure, like Hundred Battle, place his hopes on the Human Ancestor?

Su Yu still couldn't understand the Control King's betrayal. What was he after? Moreover, the Human Emperor wasn't unaware of the situation. He knew and probably informed the Control King, yet the latter didn't listen!

"The Prison..."

The Human Emperor spoke of this old comrade from years past, pausing before saying, "The Prison actually has his own beliefs and ideas! The so-called summoning of the Human Ancestor is just an excuse! He wants to open the Three Gates, not necessarily the Earth Gate. Perhaps he wants to use the Earth Gate to open other portals. I once asked him, but he didn't answer, and I didn't want to strain our relationship over this."

"The Culture King tried to persuade him back then, but he wouldn't listen. The Culture King was furious, and coincidentally, there were some cracks in the Earth Gate at the time. The Culture King sent him to kill ancient beasts, ancient clans, and the powerful beings emerging from the Earth Gate... to cut off his hopes!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Killing ancient clans to cut off hope? Was the Culture King thinking too simply?"

The Culture King couldn't have been that naive, right?

The Human Emperor, however, smiled bitterly, "The Culture King... is a bit harsher than me! He actually... wanted to use the opportunity to trap and kill the Control King! If the Control King had opened the Earth Gate back then, the Culture King would have killed him. But the Control King knew this, so during his watch, he was diligent and didn't dare to act rashly!"

Su Yu instantly understood!

How cunning!

The Culture King was indeed ruthless! They were old comrades, and he couldn't directly attack the Control King. After all, the Control King hadn't explicitly stated his intentions. But... the Culture King was an old hand at fishing. He deliberately arranged for the Control King to guard, giving him the opportunity to act!

In the end, the Control King was also smart, probably guessing the intention, and didn't make a move!

Eventually, the Culture King had to leave early, and the Control King was transferred from the Gate of Hell by the Human Emperor.

Isn't this just fishing enforcement?

Quite ruthless!

Even with old comrades, there was no mercy, though he didn't act directly, which was out of some remaining sentiment.

Su Yu quickly assessed the situation and looked at the Human Emperor, who nodded slightly, "The Culture King indeed had that intention."

He knew Su Yu could understand and said with a smile, "But... after all, we fought together for tens of thousands of years! From unifying the Myriad Realms to the later stages when the imperial court suppressed the world, the Control King was an old comrade, an old partner with whom we built our empire! After the Culture King left, I summoned him back and didn't pursue it further!"

Su Yu frowned, "But later, the Control King committed many atrocities..."

"I'm aware of some of it."

The Human Emperor shook his head, "Back then, she didn't cause any major trouble. It was only at the last moment when I wanted to lead the Myriad Races upstream, and she wanted to lead everyone to retreat behind the Earth Gate. I disagreed, and she was unwilling, so I personally sealed her into the Earth Gate! I didn't expect her to leave some loose ends, which was my oversight. I didn't pay much attention to those loose ends back then."

In reality, he didn't want to say much more. Those loose ends weren't a major problem. Zhou Tian should have been able to handle it, but then they were dealt a heavy blow by Hundred Battle!

Otherwise, before this, the Control King's faction wouldn't have dared to cause trouble.

Su Yu also realized this and couldn't help but say, "So, it's still the Great Zhou King who's rather useless, trusting Hundred Battle and getting heavily tricked!"

"Hundred Battle..."

The Human Emperor, although he hadn't met him, still smiled, "Since Zhou Tian valued him, he must have some abilities! But according to what you said, he opened the Human Gate and might have been influenced by it!"

Su Yu's expression changed slightly, "Can the Three Gates influence us?"

"Yes!"

The Human Emperor nodded slightly, "The Earth Gate contains some ancient beasts, which isn't too serious. It can summon some ancient beast shadows at most! The Human Gate is mysterious, and I'm not too familiar with it. As for the Heaven Gate..."

He chuckled, "The Heaven Gate can also influence cultivators. Of course, you opened the Heaven Gate, so it doesn't affect you much. After all, you haven't really used the Heaven Gate, treating it as a tool for observing the Dao, which is also good!"

Su Yu was stunned for a moment, then said, "Your Majesty means my Heaven Gate... is just for show?"

"Isn't it?"

The Human Emperor laughed!

I could tell at a glance, alright!

He laughed, "If the Heaven Gate is used properly, it wouldn't be like this! The Three Gates have a common function: sealing! Generally, they can seal opponents of the same level! So, let me ask you, can your Heaven Gate seal a second-class?"

Uh... no!

Su Yu hadn't even experienced it. His Heaven Gate's greatest use was for observing the Dao!

The Human Emperor continued, "The primary function of the Heaven Gate is sealing, and the secondary function is borrowing power. Do you know how to borrow?"

Su Yu blinked, I don't know, how do I borrow?

"It's about utilizing the beings within the Heaven Gate. Some powerful beings within the Heaven Gate might have similar power paths to yours, and you can summon them to borrow some power!"

It's somewhat similar to the function of the Book of Time!

But Su Yu quickly noticed the downside, "This... would allow the opponent's power to seep out, right? Even control oneself!"

"Yes, that's the downside!"

The Human Emperor nodded, "So not knowing is also a good thing!"

Su Yu, however, took a deep breath, "No, Your Majesty means that if I borrow too much power, the opponent might come through me, directly out of the Heaven Gate, like a projection, right?"

"Yes."

Su Yu grinned, "This... isn't this a great fishing technique? Previously, we worried about the Heaven Gate being opened, but now it doesn't matter. This is a perfect fishing technique! No, Your Majesty, you have to teach me this!"

Su Yu was immediately interested, "I borrow power from the opponent, and they seep into the Myriad Realms through me, projecting from the Heaven Gate shadow, projecting their power... even their true form... Tsk tsk... Catch a few second-class rulers of laws, and that's a profit! Catch a first-class... we might have a chance to kill them!"

Su Yu said excitedly, "Isn't this how the Martial Emperor did it?"

Uh!

The Human Emperor hesitated, you rascal, you're indeed not a good person!

He laughed, not stopping him, just saying, "This thing is uncertain. If you borrow from some top-tier beings, and they come out through you, it's very dangerous. You might even be possessed by their will! Of course, don't worry too much. Nowadays, even if a strong being seeps through the Heaven Gate shadow, at most, they come out as second-class! It's still manageable!"

He spoke with great confidence, and indeed, he had the strength, even though he was heavily injured now.

"Back then, it was best not to do it, as we didn't want the Heaven Gate to appear!"

Only now did Su Yu realize that the Heaven Gate had many functions!

The Human Emperor continued, "The Heaven Gate has other uses. It's something you develop yourself. Your utilization of the Heaven Gate is too low, which is actually a good thing!"

Su Yu took a deep breath and nodded.

Maybe!

No wonder I felt the Heaven Gate, apart from observing the Dao, seemed less useful than the Human Gate and Earth Gate. Turns out, I didn't understand it myself. But there's no way around it, as the Heaven Gate was previously only possessed by the Martial Emperor, and he wouldn't tell Su Yu how to use it.

"So, Your Majesty means that Hundred Battle might have been influenced by the Human Gate?"

"Very likely!"

The Human Emperor didn't mind much, but Su Yu said, "He seems to have been intimidated by the Human Ancestor's Dao weapon!"

The Human Emperor thought for a moment and said, "Then it's a dual influence! The Human Gate's influence is probably greater! This guy might have been influenced by some will from the Human Gate. Such a person..."

The Human Emperor hesitated but still said, "Is a bit useless, forget it, don't pay too much attention! If he can't withstand a little will influence, such a person is destined to achieve nothing! Those who can truly accomplish great things won't be influenced!"

Saying this, he looked at Su Yu, did you understand?

Those who accomplish great things are like me!

Hundred Battle being influenced means he's quite useless!

I say this, will you feel inferior?

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "Makes sense, it's Hundred Battle's own fault! Don't mention the will of the Human Gate shadow, even if the true forms of the Three Gates are here, I'll smash them, merge them into one, let Tongtian eat them, and lock up all the disobedient ones I don't want to kill!"

Su Yu added, "Actually, I think the Three Gates aren't very useful. Sealing is meaningless. If it were me, I'd just kill all the enemies. Why make it so complicated?"

He looked at the Human Emperor, grinning, "Your Majesty, isn't that the right idea?"

"......"

The Human Emperor was speechless, it made some sense, but this kid's look at me seems to say, if you don't listen, I'll smash you too!

Not a good person!

At this moment, the Human Emperor couldn't help but laugh, maybe it's a good thing, being lawless, I can see it!

And Su Yu was also smiling.

The Human Emperor knew many secrets, and listening to them was thrilling. At this moment, Su Yu sorted out some things he didn't understand and quickly returned to the main topic, "So, Your Majesty, do you have any thoughts on the Myriad Races now?"

"The Myriad Races..."

The Human Emperor was silent for a while, thinking before saying, "I have some ideas, but... they might not succeed!"

"Please share, Your Majesty!"

Su Yu didn't come here just to pass the time!

He also wanted to hear the Human Emperor's thoughts.

"It requires taking risks!"

The Human Emperor spoke, "Why not wait until we return to the Myriad Realms, when the Three Gates open and chaos ensues? At that time, neither the Myriad Races nor we will have the leisure to bother with others! However, that will also be the most chaotic period. If the Myriad Races are gathered by the Three Gates, we'll be in big trouble!"

Su Yu shook his head, "No waiting!"

Waiting was not a good choice! If he were willing to wait, Su Yu wouldn't have brought people here in the first place!

The Human Emperor smiled, having guessed as much. This grandson of his was not someone content with solitude or mediocrity.

"The second option... take a risk!"

The Human Emperor raised an eyebrow, "The Myriad Races are actually quite timid and don't dare to risk everything! But... if something happens to me, their courage will grow! So, I need to take a gamble, betting that the Myriad Races will dare to make an aggressive move! Their timidity is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that we've held on for so many years! The curse is... even if we set a trap, they generally won't step into it!"

Timidity has its moments. The Human Emperor had set traps before, but if the enemy didn't take the bait, there was nothing he could do. He couldn't force them into a confrontation!

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "Your Majesty means to use your injury to lure the Myriad Races into a trap?"

"Exactly!"

The Human Emperor chuckled, "Of course, under normal circumstances, they wouldn't dare to gamble or believe it! But I've not acted for many years, always confronting them with mere projections. The Myriad Races are worried, suspecting that something might be wrong with me! Yet, they still lack a catalyst to dare make a move against me!"

Su Yu grinned, "If Your Majesty is willing to take this gamble, how can you ensure they fall into the trap? What is the target of this trap? How is it set up? What is the ultimate goal? And how exactly will it be executed... would Your Majesty mind sharing?"

The Human Emperor glanced at Su Yu, falling into contemplation. After a moment of silence, he said, "You must understand, the Myriad Races aren't foolish. Once I take this gamble, they'll know I'm truly injured. If the trap fails, the pressure you'll face next will be unimaginably great!"

"As for the target, it's simple: kill some of them, weaken the Myriad Races' strength, and achieve a balance of power with minimal cost! Gradually weaken the Myriad Races before returning to the Myriad Realms, until they can no longer threaten us!"

"And the specifics?"

Su Yu pressed further.

The Human Emperor smiled, "Lure the enemy deep! Divide and conquer! Isolate, divide, and kill!"

Lure the enemy deep!

Su Yu fell into deep thought, finally speaking, "It's hard for me to set an ambush; the River of Time is too conspicuous. Should we hide underwater?"

As for how to lure the enemy deep, Su Yu stroked his chin and laughed, "If Your Majesty truly wants to gamble, it's actually simple! The Myriad Races don't believe you're injured, but Your Majesty can make them believe it... for example, by having a broken body return... Your Majesty wants to gamble one last time, to kill some of the Myriad Races' top experts!"

"Once the Myriad Races get the news, they'll definitely divide and conquer! One side will destroy the body, while the other will attack Your Majesty's sea of will!"

In truth, dividing the Myriad Races isn't difficult. It just depends on whether the Human Emperor dares to take the gamble!

The separation of body and sea of will signifies that when combined, they can fight to the death and kill a top expert. Everyone believes the Human Emperor has this strength. Naturally, when separated, they are easier to kill!

At that time, there will naturally be ways to divide the Myriad Races!

The Human Emperor chuckled softly, "I actually don't mind, but you need to think it through... if we fail, the news of my severe injury will be completely exposed! Also, my old comrades... they may not listen to you! And you, would you be willing to listen to them? If not, do you think a group of old relics, who've lived countless years, would listen to a young man in his twenties? After all, you didn't grow up together!"

"Moreover, the worst-case scenario is that I completely fall. Over here, morale might collapse... can you pull it back together?"

The Human Emperor sighed, "That's why... sometimes I want to take the gamble, but I'm afraid of failing. Even in death, I can't die!"

He can't die!

If he dies, the ancient Human Kings will surely descend into chaos!

Even the Radiant King now finds it hard to suppress those proud and fierce generals!

If the Culture King were here, there would be confidence, but the Radiant King is still lacking, and the Human Emperor can't help it!

And Su Yu... too young, too weak, lacking in prestige!

Su Yu was indeed a bold character. As soon as the Human Emperor spoke, he immediately responded, clearly having the same thought, rather than adopting a delaying tactic!

He wanted a swift resolution!

Su Yu chuckled, "Indeed, it's not easy to gamble!"

If the gamble succeeds, all is well, but if it fails... the trouble will be immense!

These two, meeting for the first time, began discussing such matters. Su Yu was straightforward, not wanting to delay, and after a moment of contemplation, he said, "Our arrival can be concealed for a while, but not for long! While the other side is still unaware of the details, there's still a chance; otherwise... opportunities will be scarce! Does Your Majesty think there's another way to lure the Myriad Races into division and depth?"

"Difficult!"

The Human Emperor shook his head, "Mainly because they've been tricked by us too many times. This generation of Myriad Races' experts has been tricked by us a lot, gaining experience from it!"

"......"

At this, Su Yu suddenly found himself at a loss for words.

He chuckled awkwardly.

This... made some sense. Knowing some of the Culture King and Human Emperor's past deeds, it's clear that these people weren't good back then, having tricked the Myriad Races' experts many times. After being tricked so often, the Myriad Races have gained experience.

In short, unless they see a guaranteed victory, the Myriad Races rarely make a move.

This is also why the stalemate has lasted for years!

Of course, because of this, the Myriad Races have missed many opportunities!

The Human Emperor also laughed, not too concerned about this. The Myriad Races fearing them is a good thing, an achievement!

But now, with Su Yu's arrival, he also wanted to take advantage of the opportunity, but unfortunately, it seemed there weren't many opportunities.

He sighed, "It's a pity you're not at the first tier, or even stronger. Otherwise... I wouldn't mind taking the gamble!"

What a pity!

Su Yu stroked his chin, indeed!

I'm still a bit weak, even at the second tier, still a bit weak!

"What about borrowing power from the Heaven Gate?"

Su Yu asked, "Can it be borrowed to the first tier?"

"Difficult!"

"Then..." Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Your Majesty, that... Xingyu Imprint, you're not using it, right? Lend it to me to merge into my world! Also, Your Majesty is on the brink of death anyway, why not merge into my world, maybe there's hope to live again, perhaps pushing me to the first tier soon!"

"......"

The Human Emperor just stared at him blankly, this... isn't it inappropriate for our first meeting?

You occupied my dojo before, borrowed my world, and now you want to borrow me personally?

Is this not letting me die in peace?

The Human Emperor laughed!

"Actually, don't say it, if you truly had achievements, powerful achievements, I wouldn't mind. But... not now. To be realistic, you haven't shown me you have the ability to suppress the Myriad Races, to suppress the Three Gates, so I won't trust my old comrades to you!"

Su Yu grinned, "Just joking, if Your Majesty really came, I'd have a headache! Besides, the world you opened is still there, truly giving it up would be a loss!"

"Moreover, truly relying on me alone... I have no confidence. If Your Majesty can recover, it would ease my burden. Killing you now would only increase my pressure, death is possible, but not now..."

"......"

Can't you speak like a human?

What do you mean death is possible!

The Human Emperor found it amusing, "You... truly aren't afraid of me?"

Su Yu was too direct!

"Afraid of what? Afraid Your Majesty will deal with me? Or afraid Your Majesty thinks I'm seizing power?"

Su Yu sighed, "To be honest, I don't want to be the leader, just forced into it! Too tiring, too exhausting, I didn't even want to come rescue Your Majesty, but... my subordinates disagreed, and I felt I had to contribute... but if Your Majesty is wary of me, wants to harm me... haha, I'll leave soon!"

Su Yu shrugged, "I'm not afraid of Your Majesty dealing with me. If you deal with me, it's to take in my subordinates, but... if something happens to me, none of them will have a good end! Your Majesty won't gain any benefits! Doing something so unwise, if the Human Emperor does it, that would be too foolish!"

"Hahaha, makes sense!"

The Human Emperor nodded, "Young as you are, you calculate clearly! But since you're here, showing your face is necessary!"

He pondered for a while, then said, "Give me a straight answer, if I release 30 rulers of laws, among them possibly a first-tier, can you take them down?"

"If you don't kill twenty or thirty rulers of laws... honestly, exposing my situation wouldn't be worth it!"

The Human Emperor said seriously, "125 of them, if 20 die, no, if more than 20 die, we can still maintain stability even if I'm severely injured! If I release 30, can you handle them? If not... there's no need to delve into this plan! Because it's meaningless!"

For now, he still had to pretend to deceive the Myriad Races.

30 of them, including a first-tier!

Su Yu grinned, "Your Majesty truly thinks highly of me!"

That's too many!

10, even with a first-tier, can be done!

30... that's almost equal to Su Yu's numbers, and crucially, there's a first-tier, unknown how many second-tiers, if things don't go smoothly, in an unexpected situation, Su Yu's side could be wiped out... first time here, total annihilation!

That would be a disaster!

The Human Emperor has 52 strong individuals, even if 30 come over, there are still 95, the Human Emperor's side would also face great pressure!

Su Yu laughed, "Your Majesty really wants to do a big job?"

"Of course!"

The Human Emperor was unfazed. "To be honest, who would willingly confront the Myriad Races for years if it wasn't absolutely necessary? If I had the strength, I would have acted long ago! Unfortunately, I'm lacking in power. Still, one must have ambition! Over the years, I've dreamed day and night about how to resolve the issue with the Myriad Races, so I can turn my attention to the matter of the Three Gates... Alas, there's no opportunity!"

Regrettably, he truly had no time to deal with the Three Gates now. The heavens were not on his side! Otherwise, given time, the problem of the Three Gates might not be hopeless to solve.

Now, seeing Su Yu, with his full ambition, the Human Emperor was reminded of his own youth. He too had been like this, but those days were gone forever.

"Thirty..."

At this moment, Su Yu was still pondering. After a while, he spoke, "Your Majesty, do you think a first-tier ruler of laws can handle several second-tier ones?"

"Three to five shouldn't be a problem!"

The Human Emperor explained, "Those few aren't particularly strong among the first-tier. If you, the Martial Emperor, and the Hundred Battle King join forces, you might have a chance against them!"

The Hundred Battle King had to be counted in! Otherwise, Su Yu's side wouldn't have enough strength to match a first-tier, as the gap with others was too large.

Su Yu quickly assessed, "Would Your Majesty be willing to lend the Hundred Battle King?"

"Certainly!"

The Human Emperor smiled, "The first-tier ones must stay, but a few second-tier ones can leave, though not too many!"

Su Yu continued to evaluate, calculating the risks. The risk was enormous! But if he didn't take the risk, he would have to wait and endure. And who knew if waiting too long would lead to unforeseen changes in the Myriad Realms.

"Then... does Your Majesty have a way to leak the information to the Myriad Races without arousing their suspicion?"

This was another major challenge!

Seeing Su Yu's detailed inquiry, the Human Emperor's eyes flickered. "Of course, I know the Myriad Races too well! If you think you can handle the trouble, I can take care of the rest. Don't think we've been idle here all these years; we haven't been doing nothing!"

Su Yu nodded. Indeed, the Human Emperor could be quite reliable at times!

The Human Emperor's voice turned somewhat somber. "But... do you really want to do this? If you get me killed... it won't benefit you!"

Little fellow, why do I feel like you really want to set me up for something big? Am I being too reckless? We've only just met, and I haven't even assessed you properly. If I die, it won't just be my problem!

Su Yu chuckled innocently. "Your Majesty, fortune favors the bold! We've come this far... can we just sit and wait? I didn't come here to loaf around. If all I did was beat up the Hundred Battle King, what's the point?"

"..."

Uh, did the Hundred Battle King get beaten up?

"Did you record it?"

"..."

The Human Emperor's sudden question left Su Yu momentarily stunned. After a while, he grinned and handed over a copy. The Human Emperor accepted it, satisfied, and laughed, "Well done, I have high hopes for you. You have potential!"

Just for this, I have high hopes for you!

Su Yu wanted to say, are you being too hasty? Damn! So, just because I recorded a video, you have high hopes for me? Is that all it takes to decide?

The Human Emperor chuckled, "From small things, big things can be inferred! Actually, I don't know nothing about you. Some things require deep understanding, which takes too long. But now, what we lack is time!"

"Su Yu, there's no point in saying too many pleasantries!"

The Human Emperor became serious. "If you can deal with the strong ones I place on your side... then the plan can proceed. Whether it succeeds or not depends on fate!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, then grinned and said, "I'll give it a try, give it my all. If it doesn't work... then it doesn't work."

The Human Emperor met his gaze, both of them with a gleam in their eyes!

Then... let's give it a try!

The Human Emperor laughed, and so did Su Yu.

Suddenly, both burst into laughter. Behind them, the Hundred Battle King and Radiant King glanced over. The conversation seemed quite pleasant, and things looked promising!

At this moment, Su Yu and the Human Emperor had reached a tacit understanding!

Go for it!

What was there to fear?

The Human Emperor wasn't being hasty, but he knew that perhaps... this was the only choice!

While Su Yu was still willing and daring to act, they had to move quickly. The fear was that if Su Yu saw things going south, he might run, and that would be truly terrifying!

He had to find a way to restrict Su Yu, or else the Human Emperor was very worried that this seemingly unyielding young man might actually pull it off!

Thinking of this, the Human Emperor, still smiling, suddenly said, "By the way, last time you lent me the power of your world, I borrowed it. If I die, I'll merge my entire world into yours just before I die, okay?"

"..."

Su Yu was taken aback. "Your Majesty... can you control it remotely?"

"When a person is about to die, no price is too high!"

The Human Emperor chuckled, "I still have some strength, after all. At that time, my Great Dao of the world should become the mainstream Dao in your world, and you will have inherited my will!"

Su Yu's mouth twitched.

In simple terms, the Human Emperor meant that if he died, he would merge his Great Dao, the Dao of Responsibility, into Su Yu's world!

Then, his Dao of Responsibility, being very strong, would dominate Su Yu's world... and suddenly, the main structure of Su Yu's world would change, and... Su Yu would become the next Human Emperor!

The Dao of Responsibility as the main Dao!

He looked at the Human Emperor, smiling, with a somewhat forced smile. "Your Majesty, is that necessary?"

"It is necessary!"

The Human Emperor chuckled, "If I die, people won't submit to you! With my world merged, your strength will increase, and having inherited my Dao, my old comrades will also submit to you! Isn't that great? Right?"

"..."

To hell with you!

Su Yu cursed inwardly. You're just trying to set me up, aren't you?

So, you're afraid I'll set you up, huh?

So you give me a preventive measure. If you die, I, Su Yu, will be as unlucky as you, inheriting the so-called Dao of Responsibility. Wouldn't that make me a babysitter?

The Human Emperor saw that Su Yu understood and chuckled.

I'm offering you a benefit, not threatening you, little fellow. You need to think it through!

For a moment, the two exchanged smiles again, but this time, their smiles were somewhat insincere!
