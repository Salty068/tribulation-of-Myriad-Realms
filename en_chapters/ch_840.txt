Chapter 840: A Hypocritical Smile (Seeking Subscriptions)

At this moment, Su Yu and the Human Emperor were having a very pleasant conversation… or so it seemed!

Su Yu still had many questions he wanted to ask, but after some consideration, he decided not to rush. There was no need to ask everything now. He quickly returned to the main topic. “Then, if we arrive from the rear now, once the Myriad Races on the front line discover our presence… that would give them a chance to unite! Your Majesty, do you have any plans to deal with them?”

They had been in a standoff for so many years; Su Yu didn’t believe the Human Emperor had no ideas.

Since the Human Emperor had long prepared for reinforcements from the rear, what about now?

At this moment, the Human Emperor suddenly sighed. “If I were still in my peak state, I would simply force my way through! Slaying a few first-tier rulers of laws would naturally make some of the Myriad Races cower… not everyone is fearless of death! In that case, dealing with them would be simple!”

Unfortunately, he wasn’t in his peak state now.

The Human Emperor continued, “When fighting the Myriad Races, we can’t go too far. Otherwise, if they decide to fight to the death, we won’t have time to develop further, and once the Three Gates open… we’ll be finished too!”

The losses couldn’t be too great!

Over 80 rulers of laws against over

The Human Emperor smiled and said, “Control King… it’s hard to say! Releasing Human Ancestor, I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing, but it’s not the right time! Opening the Earth Gate, all Three Gates might be opened, and that’s not the time to open the Three Gates!”

“Then didn’t Control King know this situation?”

Su Yu said in a deep voice, “Why did she betray us?”

As a Four Extremes Human King, knowing that opening the Three Gates was dangerous, yet insisting on it, why?
Even at the cost of betrayal!
Was Human Ancestor that important in her eyes?
Don’t be ridiculous!
Control King was a Four Extremes Human King, at that time possibly a peak second-tier or even already a first-tier. Would such a powerful expert, like Hundred Battle King, place her hopes on Human Ancestor?
Regarding Control King’s betrayal… Su Yu still hadn’t figured out what she was after!
Moreover, the Human Emperor wasn’t unaware of the situation; he knew, and perhaps even told Control King, but she still didn’t listen!

“Control King…”
The Human Emperor spoke of his old comrade-in-arms from yesteryear, falling silent for a moment before saying, “Control King, actually, has her own ideals, her own thoughts! The so-called welcoming of Human Ancestor was just an excuse! She wanted to open the Three Gates, not necessarily just the Earth Gate; perhaps she wanted to open other Gates through opening the Earth Gate. I once asked her, but she didn’t answer me, and I didn’t want to fall out with her over this.”

“Culture King tried to persuade her back then, but she wouldn’t listen. Culture King was very angry at the time, and coincidentally, some cracks appeared in the Earth Gate. So Culture King told her to kill ancient beasts, kill ancient races, kill the powerful experts appearing from the Earth Gate… to cut off her hope!”

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, “Killing ancient races would cut off her hope? Did Culture King think too simply?”
Culture King wouldn’t be that simple-minded, right?

The Human Emperor, however, gave a bitter smile, “Culture King… is a bit more ruthless than me! He actually… wanted to use the opportunity to trap and kill Control King! If Control King had opened the Earth Gate at that time, Culture King would have killed her, but Control King herself knew this, so during the period she guarded it, she was diligent and didn’t dare to act rashly!”

Su Yu instantly understood!
He clicked his tongue in wonder!
Culture King was indeed ruthless!
They were old comrades-in-arms, so he couldn’t directly attack Control King, after all, Control King hadn’t explicitly said she would open it. But… Culture King was an old angler; he was fishing, deliberately arranging for Control King to guard it, giving her a chance to open it!
As a result, Control King was also smart, probably guessing his intention, and didn’t make a move!
Finally, Culture King had to leave early, and Control King was also transferred from the Gate of Hell by the Human Emperor.
Isn’t this entrapment?
Quite ruthless!
Even for old comrades-in-arms, he was merciless, just not directly attacking, which was probably out of consideration for their remaining feelings.

Su Yu immediately deduced this and looked at the Human Emperor, who nodded slightly, “Culture King indeed had

The Human Emperor spoke, "How about we wait? Wait until we return to the Myriad Realms, until all Three Gates open, and heaven and earth fall into great chaos. At that time, neither the Myriad Races nor us will have time to bother with anyone else! However, that will also be the most chaotic period. Once the Myriad Races are gathered by the Three Gates, our trouble will be immense!"

Su Yu shook his head. "No waiting!"

Waiting was not a good choice.

If he were willing to wait, Su Yu wouldn't have brought anyone here in the first place!

The Human Emperor smiled. He had guessed it. This fellow was not someone content with solitude or mediocrity.

"Second... take a gamble!"

The Human Emperor raised an eyebrow. "The Myriad Races are actually quite timid; they don't dare to fight to the death! But... if something were to happen to me, their courage would grow! So, I need to take a gamble, to bet that the Myriad Races will dare to act rashly just once! The Myriad Races being timid is a good thing, but also a bad thing. Good, because we've held on for so many years! Bad, because... even if we set a trap, they won't dare to step into an ordinary one, they simply won't!"

Being timid also depended on the timing.

It wasn't that the Human Emperor hadn't set traps before, but if they ignored them, there was nothing he could do, and he couldn't force an attack!

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "Your Majesty means to use your severe injuries to lure the Myriad Races into a trap?"

"Precisely!"

The Human Emperor chuckled. "Of course, under normal circumstances, they wouldn't dare to gamble, wouldn't dare to believe! But I haven't made a move for many years, only confronting them with a Shadow. The Myriad Races are actually worried and suspicious, suspecting that something has happened to me! Yet, they still lack a crucial opportunity before they dare to act against me!"

Su Yu chuckled. "If Your Majesty takes this gamble, how can you make them enter the trap? What is the target of this trap? How will it be set up? What is the ultimate goal? And specifically, how will it be operated... Would Your Majesty mind explaining?"

The Human Emperor glanced at Su Yu and fell into contemplation.

After a moment of silence, he said, "You must understand, the Myriad Races aren't foolish. Once I take this gamble, they will know that I am truly severely injured. If the trap fails, the pressure you will face afterward will be unimaginably immense!"

"As for the target, it's simple: kill some individuals, weaken the Myriad Races' strength, and at the smallest cost, re-establish a balance of power between us! Weaken the Myriad Races little by little, until they are incapable of shaking us before we return

The Human Emperor was unconcerned. "Honestly, who would want to confront the Myriad Races for so many years if it wasn't absolutely necessary? If I had the strength, I would have acted long ago! Unfortunately, my strength is insufficient! But one must still have ambition! Over these years, I've thought day and night about how to resolve the Myriad Races, return early, and free up my hands to deal with the Three Gates… Alas, I haven't had the chance!"

Regrettably, he truly had no time to manage the matter of the Three Gates now!

Heaven was not on his side!

Otherwise, given time, the calamity of the Three Gates wasn't without hope of being resolved.

Now, seeing Su Yu and his abundant ambition, the Human Emperor actually thought of his own youth, when he was the same. However, he couldn't go back to the past!

"Thirty individuals…"

At this moment, Su Yu was still thinking. After a long while, he finally said, "Your Majesty, how many Second-tier rulers of laws do you think one First-tier ruler of laws can handle?"

"Three to five is still no problem!"

The Human Emperor explained, "Those few aren't too strong among the First-tier. If you, the Martial Emperor, and War King team up, three against one, there's hope of dealing with them!"

They still had to include War King!

Otherwise, Su Yu's side wouldn't have enough strength to match a First-tier ruler of
