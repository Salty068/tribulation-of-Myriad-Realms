Chapter 797: The Outbreak of War! (Please Subscribe)

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with Dragon Heavenly Venerable. Everything was going according to plan. As expected, when he struck Dragon Heavenly Venerable and began advancing deeper, the others gave up on causing trouble. There was no need. As for the unlucky one, it was merely Dragon Heavenly Venerable. Although he suffered a loss, losing his weapon, if he were to pursue Su Yu now... well, coming alone would be futile, and if they all came, Su Yu's role as the vanguard would be completely nullified. So, even if they snatched it, it would be in vain.

"Refreshing!"

At this moment, Giant Axe laughed heartily. It was truly satisfying. They had beaten Dragon Heavenly Venerable, snatched his weapon, and the opponent didn't even dare to utter a word. This feeling was exhilarating! Comfortable!

A group of seven, including March and Giant Axe, sped along, all feeling quite pleased. Fat Ball spat out a mountain full of divine charm and essence, compressed into a small hill, wagging its tail joyfully, "Here, I snatched it!"

Su Yu glanced at it, smiled, and looked towards Tongtian, sending a voice transmission, "You take it, find an opportunity to teleport it over to Hongmeng!"

Hongmeng Heavenly Venerable was assured! Another Heavenly Venerable under his command. Tongtian, though somewhat reluctant, didn't want to run, but... fine, he still had work to do. At worst, he would send it back and return immediately. He was still keeping an eye on the others. Did Moon Luo have the Gate of Hell? That old ancestor certainly did! Besides them, these Heavenly Venerables might all have it. If he devoured them all, Tongtian could also become a Heavenly Venerable!

Feeling satisfied, Tongtian quickly stored the mountain into his portal. His mood was quite good. Following Su Yu meant having meat to eat. He had already reached the Heavenly King level, and becoming a Heavenly Venerable wasn't too far off.

The group quickly flew deeper, crossing the great river, reaching the depths. Even for Su Yu and his group, it took a minute or two. Last time, they used this time gap to kill Moon Harp and the others. This time, unable to launch a surprise attack, Su Yu and his group weren't in a hurry. After flying for a while, they slowed down. Because ahead, they could already sense the opponent's presence.

...

About a minute later, the two sides were about ten thousand meters apart, staring at each other across the distance. Opposite them were four Heavenly Venerables, with Moon Luo at the forefront. There were as many as twelve Heavenly King auras. Below the Heavenly Kings, there were over forty Daofuse Realm experts. This lineage truly had many strong individuals. It should be noted that before this, Su Yu had killed a Heavenly Venerable, severely injured Yue Hao, and last time, killed five Heavenly King-level experts. Yet, even now, the other side still had countless strong individuals. Moreover, there was that old ancestor, plus a ruler of laws within the Gate of Hell.

This time, Moon Luo wasn't as flamboyant as before. Her black hair fluttered, her figure swayed, and from about ten thousand meters away, she coldly said, "Su Yu, do you insist on being the lackey of the myriad races?"

"Whether it's the Human Race or the Sacred Race, it's an internal struggle! Why make it easy for the myriad races and act as their lackey?"

Su Yu laughed.

"Internal struggle?"

Su Yu laughed wildly, "Are you even worthy? Haven't you declared yourselves the Sacred Race? I have announced to the heavens that you are a race of sinners. How are you still the same race? You have the audacity to kill my people!"

This... there was no reasoning with him. The Heavenly Venerables' faces turned livid! Kill your people? Last time, Su Yu killed dozens of their Daofuse experts, five Heavenly Kings, and a Heavenly Venerable, and previously severely injured Yue Hao. If there was hatred, it should be theirs! Now, Su Yu wasn't even willing to let it go!

The Control King's lineage was extremely furious at this moment, with each strong individual bursting with aura. The number of Heavenly Venerables was the same, but they had many more Heavenly Kings and Daofuse experts. Whether Heavenly Kings or Heavenly Venerables, they were essentially at the same level. In a real fight, two or three Heavenly Kings could match a Heavenly Venerable! However, Moon Luo and the others were wary of the myriad races intervening at this moment and were eager to delay time, naturally unwilling to start a war now!

Beside Moon Luo, an elderly man with white hair coldly said, "Su Yu, if a war truly breaks out, as long as the myriad races are slightly late, you will surely die! Why act as the vanguard for the myriad races? If they dared to come, they would have done so already. They just want to watch the tigers fight from the mountain. You are a Human Lord, must you be so foolish and reckless?"

Su Yu laughed, "Simple, kill Yue Hao..." As he spoke, he pointed at Moon Luo, "And her, and another woman..." Su Yu searched among the crowd, quickly spotting Yu Xi among the Heavenly Kings, pointing at her, "And her! Kill these three, offer their blood as a sacrifice for my subordinates, and I will no longer oppose you!"

Impossible!

Everyone was furious! Two Heavenly Venerables and a Heavenly King, just because of Su Yu's words, were to be killed? How could the Sacred Race stand? Su Yu's words were nothing but nonsense!

At this moment, beside Moon Luo, the third Heavenly Venerable-level expert, holding a giant axe, looked at Su Yu and his group, coldly saying, "Why say more? Kill them!"

With that, his voice roared in all directions, "Eight-Winged Tiger, Chaos Dragon, are you just going to watch? Don't forget, this matter is closely related to you!"

With these words, ancient beasts roared from the north and south. Moments later, strong individuals flew out from both sides. On one side was the Eight-Winged Tiger, leading over forty Daofuse ancient beasts, and on the other was the Chaos Dragon, also bringing nearly fifty ancient beasts. Incredibly powerful! The two giant beasts exuded overwhelming auras.

At this moment, the voice of the Eight-Winged Tiger echoed, "Human race strong ones, we do not wish to be your enemies. Retreat quickly, and we shall not interfere with each other!"

And at this moment, from the myriad races' side, a large number of Daofuse experts soared into the sky, with the voice of the Sacred Marquis echoing, "Rest assured, Human Lord, we will block these Chaos Ancient Beasts!"

Since they wanted Su Yu to take the lead, they couldn't go too far. Seeing the Chaos Ancient Beasts flying out, there was actually a tacit understanding between the myriad races and the ancient beasts, with both sides staying out of it! Yes, this was the result brought back by Destiny and Moon Heavenly Venerable. Before the outbreak of war, both sides were in a standoff, temporarily not letting the Chaos Dragon and others be exposed. And at this moment, the myriad races still thought Su Yu was unaware. But Su Yu knew better than anyone.

Of course, this was the best outcome. He wasn't at ease with the Chaos Dragon and others. Being intercepted outside was the best.

...

Moon Luo's face slightly changed. Although the myriad races hadn't directly attacked, blocking the two groups of ancient beasts still weakened their strength. At this moment, should they attack Su Yu and his group? Twelve Heavenly Kings, nine more than Su Yu's side, with a Heavenly King combat power of 4 to 1, they would surely win! The key was, if they fought, the war would be fully initiated! The Control King's lineage preferred to delay. The old ancestor's order was also to delay! The longer, the better! Delay until Yu Qing emerged!

And Su Yu was also waiting, not in a hurry. Why rush? If the ruler of laws from the Control King's lineage didn't come out, wouldn't there be no good show to watch? He was also curious about the choices of the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger. These two ancient beasts were not good people. Anyone who thought they were... well, they were courting death. Chaos Ancient Beasts, if they weren't without wisdom, since they had developed wisdom, they wouldn't be too stupid. Don't be fooled by the Eight-Winged Tiger's antics of drinking soy sauce and pretending to read books. It might look cute, but it might be older than Hongmeng.

"Self-preservation first!"

At this moment, Su Yu once again transmitted to those around him, not seeking to kill the enemy, not seeking anything else, but self-preservation was the priority. "Guerrilla warfare, main target, approach their lair. They must be summoning that one, and at this moment, they won't dare let us get close!"

Su Yu issued another command. The next moment, Marquis Tongtian suddenly opened a portal, and several people instantly entered. In the blink of an eye, the void fluctuated, and they traversed towards the lair behind!

"Rip!"

"Seal!"

Several shouts erupted simultaneously. In an instant, Moon Luo and the others acted, the void tore apart, space trembled, and a passage opened by Marquis Tongtian instantly appeared. In an instant, more than ten Heavenly Kings attacked!

Boom!

The passage exploded, and Marquis Tongtian screamed. Seven people fell out of the passage! Moon Luo's face was cold and stern, "Courting death! Su Yu, I didn't want to make things difficult for you, but you are seeking death! Set up the formation!"

At this moment, in the entire Chaos Mountain region, light points suddenly appeared one after another. In the distance, more than ten Daofuse experts shouted, appearing from the void, and formation bases emerged. At this moment, above Chaos Mountain, it seemed as if a large net appeared, covering Su Yu and his group!

Marquis Giant Axe, being well-informed, saw this and his face changed, shouting, "Infernal Formation, sealing divine skills, sealing space... be careful!"

This was specifically targeting space-path experts. Sealing the surrounding space, making it impossible to tear or traverse. Set up by 18 Daofuse Realm experts working together. Unless Marquis Tongtian could break the combined power of 18 people, he couldn't break this formation. 18 Daofuse... a Heavenly King could generally handle five, but more than that was impossible. How could he handle 18?

Marquis Tongtian attempted to open a portal, but indeed, the portal was difficult to open! Marquis Tongtian's face slightly changed, "Your Majesty!" They were sealed! The Control King's lineage was indeed troublesome. The freely traversing Marquis Tongtian was instantly locked down, his hands and feet restricted.

...

In the distance, the myriad races and Chaos Ancient Beasts were in a standoff, also watching the battle. Seeing this scene, the myriad races quickly took note, with the Sacred Marquis solemnly saying, "Infernal Formation, the Control King's signature formation. Breaking this formation is very difficult! Indeed, the Control King's lineage hasn't been idle all these years. Who knows how many traps have been laid in the depths of Chaos Mountain!"

This was the advantage of having Su Yu and his group take the lead! Everyone watched, forcing the Control King's lineage to reveal their methods, finding ways to counter them. Otherwise, anyone teleporting over now might be completely locked down! This way, many losses could be avoided.

Beside him, Destiny Marquis's forehead eye remained open, looking over there, and he said solemnly, "Su Yu and his group may not be able to hold on. The opponent is inherently strong, and now they've locked down their escape space!"

Dragon Heavenly Venerable cursed, "Let them be locked down. Four Heavenly Venerables, even if they fight to the death, can still take down some strong ones. Su Yu and his group aren't good people. It's best if they all die. If they can take down one or two Heavenly Venerables, it's worth it!"

He never intended to rescue Su Yu and the others! Let them all die!

The others, though silent, shared a similar sentiment. It would be best if Su Yu and his group fought to the death. Several Heavenly Sovereigns and Heavenly Kings had gone mad; surely, they could kill two Heavenly Sovereigns, right? Su Yu and his group were not weaklings!

...

At the same time, on the opposite side, the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger gathered. These two ancient beasts, along with over a hundred Daofuse ancient beasts, blocked the powerful forces of the myriad races across the great river.

The Chaos Dragon's tail had already regenerated, though it was far from its former strength. As it flew over, it transmitted a message, "Eight Wings, how long do we hold them off?"

"No rush!" The Eight-Winged Tiger noticed that the myriad races seemed disinclined to rescue Su Yu's group. It turned its gaze towards Su Yu's side and transmitted, "This person has opened a world and commands many strong subordinates. You know this; they won't die so easily! It would be best if we could force him to reveal all his hidden strength... He has opened a world, and perhaps... he has moved his world into the depths of chaos... Brother Dragon, here, you and I are actually the weakest, so be cautious!"

There was no need to worry about Su Yu and his group. Besides, he wasn't concerned. If they died, so be it. They weren't that familiar!

The Chaos Dragon nodded slightly, transmitting, "What if the myriad races advance on us?"

"We'll hold them off until our losses reach half. If it exceeds half, we'll retreat immediately... Losing half is enough to earn the trust of the Control King's lineage!"

"Agreed!"

The two ancient beasts quickly reached a consensus. Although the Chaos Dragon was stronger than the Eight-Winged Tiger, it still heeded the latter's advice. They had known each other for many years, and the Chaos Dragon knew that the tiger, despite its seemingly simple nature, was actually cunning. However, until their plan was achieved, the Eight-Winged Tiger wouldn't turn against him.

...

"Attack!"

At this moment, Yue Luo and his group swiftly surrounded Su Yu and his companions! The myriad races hadn't made a move! That was good news! If they could kill Su Yu and his group before the myriad races acted, it would be ideal.

"Don't let them encircle us!" Su Yu, who often encircled others, naturally understood the trouble of being surrounded.

At this moment, he opened his Heaven Gate, instantly looking towards the sky. A large net descended, covering them. This was the formation set up by eighteen Daofuse cultivators. However, while difficult for ordinary people to break, it wasn't too challenging for Su Yu.

A pen suddenly appeared in Su Yu's hand. With a stroke, a cracking sound echoed, as if something shattered.

"Break!"

With a low shout, Su Yu struck again, shattering the void. Then, his group quickly vanished.

But Yue Luo and his group were prepared. The Heaven Gate was troublesome! They all knew this. Just as Su Yu shattered the net's threads, outside the broken net, chaotic lightning suddenly struck down, chaos energy erupting.

Su Yu sneered. Chaos power? Chaos lightning? I'm all too familiar with this!

He reached out, and in an instant, a great dao appeared. In the blink of an eye, the descending chaotic lightning was dismantled. Su Yu quickly led his group deeper into the chaos, laughing wildly, "Petty tricks!"

Yue Luo and his companions' expressions changed! This guy was truly troublesome.

"Open my Divine Gate, let the Divine Gate cover the sky!"

At that moment, several gates, the Gates of Hell, appeared in the sky—not just one, but six—instantly pressing down on Su Yu and his group.

Marquis Tongtian was initially delighted to see the first gate, but when he saw all six, his face turned green!

Damn it!

"Run!"

Marquis Tongtian shouted, and Su Yu's group quickly fled. Suddenly, from within the six gates, a surge of willpower emerged!

In the next moment, it coalesced into an enormous beast that covered the sky!

There was a monster behind the gates! Yue Hao had demonstrated this last time. Now, six gates, three from Heavenly Sovereigns and three from Heavenly Kings, outlined a beast.

This beast was merely a projection of willpower, yet its aura was incredibly powerful. Upon appearing, it roared, swallowing the heavens and devouring the sun.

At this moment, Fat Ball also roared, instantly turning black, and lunged at the beast!

"Awwooo!"

Boom!

A loud noise echoed as Fat Ball yelped in pain, nearly breaking its teeth. It howled in grievance, "So strong, I can't beat it!"

Once again, it couldn't win!

Su Yu was also helpless, looking at the beast in the sky. This should be a projection summoned from behind the Chaos Gate, and the beast's true form was undoubtedly a master of rules! And not an ordinary one!

At this moment, it was incredibly powerful. Not only that, but the beast even spoke, with a somewhat human-like gaze, looking at Fat Ball, it said indifferently, "A Sun-Eating Divine Dog! What a pity... it seems much weaker! The gates open, chaos descends, and the world cannot stop it. If you wish to obstruct, then you shall die!"

The momentum was unstoppable; who dared to obstruct?

At this moment, the beast suddenly sprouted a pair of fleshy wings, its speed breaking through the void. Its massive body moved with incredible speed, disappearing in a flash, leaving a deep, bone-revealing wound on Fat Ball.

Fat Ball roared, a boot flying out, smashing the void with a boom, but the beast vanished instantly!

"Run!"

Su Yu shouted, and Fat Ball, eyes blood-red, actually wanted to fight this guy! The beast was strong, but it was just a projection. If they fought with all their might, Fat Ball might not lose. But Fat Ball remained calm.

When Su Yu said run, it didn't linger, quickly grabbing the boot and fleeing.

The beast reappeared from the void, somewhat surprised, "I didn't expect... the Sun-Eating Divine Dog would run away!"

At this moment, Yue Luo's voice echoed, "Supreme, stop them!"

The beast glanced at Yue Luo, said nothing, and quickly vanished into the void.

Yue Luo and his group also quickly followed. Both sides moved with extreme speed! In the brief exchange, Su Yu's group seemed to be at a disadvantage, first with the sealing formation, then with the six gates summoning an incredibly powerful ancient beast projection, all unexpected!

...

"Ancient Brolong Beast!"

At this moment, the former consort spoke solemnly, "It's an ancient Brolong beast from the chaos, skilled in speed and devouring! This is a projection from behind the Gates of Hell, formed by condensed willpower, its strength... not inferior to the Coronal Heavenly Venerable!"

A terrifying existence! Just a willpower projection was comparable to the Coronal Heavenly Venerable. The true form must be incredibly powerful. The Gates of Hell from the Control King's lineage actually had this function. Six gates summoned such a formidable existence. Could more gates summon even stronger beings?

Su Yu and his group were wading through the chaos for everyone. Otherwise, in battle, if caught off guard, first sealed, then devoured by the existence behind the Gates of Hell, even an ordinary Heavenly Sovereign would be in danger of falling.

At this moment, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign was also extremely solemn, "This creature's true form is probably much stronger than the tailless dragon! Fortunately!"

Somewhat relieved, it was fortunate that Su Yu and his group were the ones wading through the chaos. Su Yu's group had many methods and strong power. That dog, after turning black, combined with the boot, was not inferior to the Coronal Heavenly Venerable.

One had to admit, at this moment, these Heavenly Sovereigns were also apprehensive. Both sides had top-tier experts. Fortunately, Su Yu was currently leading the charge for them; otherwise, it would be a big problem.

Meanwhile, Destiny Marquis frowned slightly, "Make a move, even if just for show! Otherwise, if Su Yu and his group run away, are we not going to fight? At least let Su Yu see our sincerity! Kill some ancient beasts first!"

On the Immortal Clan's side, Tiangu was silent for a moment before speaking instantly, "Make a move, kill the ancient beasts, and force the two ancient beast powerhouses to retreat!"

"Understood!"

In an instant, hundreds of Daofuse cultivators soared into the sky, and several Heavenly Sovereigns shouted simultaneously, "Cross the river, kill!"

On the opposite side, the tailless dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger exchanged a glance. The next moment, they shouted, "Kill the enemy, invade the chaos, kill!"

In an instant, a battle erupted between hundreds of Daofuse cultivators on both sides! In this chaotic land, the chaotic ancient beasts still had the advantage, but the myriad races had more people and more Heavenly Sovereigns. Almost in the blink of an eye, three or four chaotic ancient beasts were killed on the spot, rules in turmoil!

The entire Chaos Mountain was plunged into chaos!

...

"Your Majesty!"

At this moment, Giant Axe quickly transmitted, "Your Majesty, they're fighting, can we retreat now?"

The pressure was immense!

Su Yu didn't respond. Fighting? Nonsense! The myriad races and the Eight-Winged Tiger were just playing around! The battle on both sides was just for show, what did a few dead ancient beasts matter? The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon didn't care at all!

Su Yu quickly transmitted, "Stop talking nonsense, keep going. We must reach their lair and force them to deploy more powerhouses to stop us. The myriad races want us to lead the charge for one purpose: to find out the exact strength of the Control King's lineage... and we also need to pave the way for the myriad races!"

It's dangerous, but necessary. Because, without understanding the exact strength of the Control King's lineage, the myriad races would be wary, and if they truly encountered a crisis and were wiped out, it wouldn't be fun!

As he spoke, a shadow flickered. In the next moment, ahead, a giant beast appeared, with six gates faintly visible within its body.

Su Yu looked at Tongtian, "Eat it!"

"..."

Marquis Tongtian almost cried, eat your sister! It's so powerful, it might as well eat me! Where do I get the qualifications to eat it?

"Useless!"

Su Yu cursed, weren't you boasting about eating everyone's gates? Look, now there are six gates here, eat them!

"Break!"

Su Yu shouted, slashing forward. The giant beast blocking the way lunged at Su Yu, boom! The collision of great dao rules!

Su Yu staggered back a few steps, while the beast's figure trembled slightly. At this moment, March and the others attacked together, boom! The giant beast was knocked back by March's giant bamboo!

"Giant Bamboo!"

March let out a fierce shout, and suddenly, Marquis Giant Bamboo transformed into an enormous bamboo stalk. March grabbed it and swung it at the opponent, his strength increasing by threefold!

Holding Marquis Giant Bamboo, March's combat power surged, almost comparable to the darkened state of Fat Ball. It was bizarre!

With a single swing, March sent the enemy flying. He glanced at Su Yu and quickly explained, "Giant Bamboo is an anomaly of our race. We eat bamboo, but he ate so much that he imagined himself as a giant bamboo. His path is not our usual path but the Giant Bamboo Path, hence the title Marquis Giant Bamboo!"

"…"

Su Yu was speechless. He knew a bit about it, but he never imagined that Marquis Giant Bamboo could transform himself into a giant bamboo! Truly, the world is full of wonders!

Behind them, Yue Luo and her group were rapidly closing in!

Boom!

A surge of powerful energy rushed towards Su Yu and his companions.

The white-haired Heavenly Venerable shouted angrily, "Retreat now, and you might live! Otherwise, you walk the path of death!"

A powerful figure wielding a giant axe swung it at Marquis Giant Axe.

Marquis Giant Axe roared back, swinging his own axe!

Well, well, it seemed they had met their match!

Let's see whose axe is mightier!

At the same time, a soft chuckle echoed, resonating in everyone's hearts.

"Put down your weapons!"

The tingling voice caused Marquis Giant Axe to falter, March to momentarily lose focus, and Xuelan's freezing power nearly went out of control.

Just then, a thunderous roar shook the heavens.

"Yue Luo, seeking death!"

Yue Luo's path of enchantment seemed to provoke Su Yu, who had been calm until now, into a frenzy. A massive hammer appeared once more, and boom! He swung it backward, covering the entire Chaos Mountain with its force!

A berserk Su Yu!

He despised this woman!

Annoying!

I'll smash you with one hammer!

Yue Luo's expression changed slightly, and she couldn't help but curse!

She was strong, and her path of enchantment was even stronger. The reactions of Marquis Giant Axe and March, both Heavenly Venerables, were proof. In a life-and-death battle, she could heavily injure them in an instant, if not kill them!

But then she encountered someone like Su Yu.

Look at Xuelan; even she was affected, yet Su Yu remained unaffected!

Incredible!

Not only was he unaffected, but every time she used her path of enchantment, it was as if she had desecrated Su Yu's ancestors' graves, provoking him into a frenzy. Yue Luo couldn't understand which nerve of Su Yu's she had touched!

Meanwhile, up ahead, Fat Ball and the Dragon Beast were locked in a fierce battle, shaking the heavens and earth, both roaring ferociously!

Seeing a large number of powerful enemies closing in, Su Yu's expression changed. The next moment, his aura fluctuated, and he roared, "Prepare to self-destruct!"

"…"

The surrounding powerful figures who had just closed in quickly retreated, including Yue Luo and her group.

No other reason… these bastards had done it before!

They weren't just bluffing!

Facing Su Yu and his group, who were like rolling stones, everyone found it a headache. They hadn't even reached the point of death, and just as the battle began, this bastard was already threatening to self-destruct!

"Run!"

Boom!

A group of people traversed the void, fleeing rapidly. Marquis Giant Axe stumbled, nearly dragged down by Su Yu, and asked in a daze, "Not exploding?"

He had heard about this!

Last time, Su Yu had ordered a self-destruction, and everyone exploded. Those who exploded were allies, and those who didn't were outsiders!

He thought they were really going to self-destruct!

Su Yu was speechless. Nonsense!

Cultivating to the Heavenly Venerable level is so difficult!

If the physical body exploded, where would I find the power of so many physical bodies to restore you all? This time is different from last time. Last time was to distinguish friend from foe and to hide myself.

This time, all the strength is here, and I'm showing it to everyone.

Explode my foot!

However, having experienced it last time was a good thing. Not only did Marquis Giant Axe, an ally, believe it, but Yue Luo and her group also retreated the moment Su Yu shouted.

They watched helplessly as Su Yu and his group escaped the encirclement!

"Damn it!"

Yue Luo shouted angrily, and the others were equally disgraced.

Each one was furious!

Humiliated!

So many powerful figures, yet they all retreated.

Well, a person's reputation precedes them!

Last time, Su Yu had killed a Heavenly Venerable and several Heavenly Kings, and everyone was terrified of him. Others used self-destruction as a deterrent, but for Su Yu, it was a means of killing the enemy.

…

"Useless!"

At this moment, deep within the mountainous kingdom.

The old ancestor, Yue Zhan, cursed!

So many powerful figures were blocking Su Yu and his group, yet they were getting closer!

What else could they be but useless?

Damn bastards!

"Yue Hao!"

Yue Zhan shouted coldly, "Command the ancient beast to join the battle!"

"Understood!"

From within the mountains, a low voice echoed, and the next moment, Yue Hao appeared. However, it wasn't his true form but a colossal beast, incredibly powerful, flying out of the mountainous kingdom and swiftly heading towards Su Yu and his group!

…

In front of the Gate of Hell.

Behind the gate, those cold eyes appeared once more, carrying a somber tone, "Yue Zhan, you've messed everything up. If the Holy Lord finds out, you won't have a good end!"

Yue Zhan gritted his teeth, "I know! Senior Sister, it was all an accident!"

"An accident?"

A cold and harsh voice from Yu Qing echoed, "After ten thousand years of dormancy, and now, at this critical moment, you encounter an accident… how convenient!"

Foolish!

After countless years of dormancy, at the critical moment, an accident occurs. Who could accept that?

Yue Zhan was also furious, "It's all because of that Su Yu! This lunatic attacked us last time, leading to Yue Qin's death! Moreover, our exposure was also his doing!"

"Su Yu…"

Yu Qing murmured, quickly turning cold and harsh, "Then kill him! At any cost! With so many people, can't you kill him? Tell Yue Luo and the others, at all costs! Kill Su Yu and his group, and when I come out, even though there are many Heavenly Venerables among the myriad races, you and I together can kill them all!"

With that, Yu Qing's willpower surged out, "Eight Wings, Chaos Dragon, give it your all!"

Her willpower surged out, commanding the two ancient beasts to act!

Not only that, but at this moment, within the Gate of Hell, waves of willpower surged out, "Come to Chaos Mountain, kill the invading enemies, the envoy is about to manifest!"

Those pairs of eyes emitted waves, summoning the chaotic beasts of the outside world!

To kill Su Yu and his group!

…

At this moment.

Deep within the chaos.

The Tea Plant suddenly trembled slightly, and the next moment, it transmitted a message below, "I… I seem to have received an order to kill His Majesty and the others!"

Below, a group of powerful figures gathered.

Lantian quickly asked, "Where did the order come from?"

"It seems to be from the chaotic will behind the Gate of Hell!"

The Tea Plant knew a bit about it. At this moment, it was also part of the chaotic race, but its will was clear, and it wasn't greatly affected.

But at this moment, everyone heard the roars coming from the depths of chaos!

It seemed that powerful ancient beasts were awakening!

Lantian's expression changed slightly, and he quickly sent a message to Su Yu. The existence within the Gate of Hell could actually control ancient beasts. This had happened once before when Su Yu opened the heavens.

But that time wasn't very specific, and the Eight-Winged Tiger didn't say much.

This time, the Tea Plant personally sensed it. There was a chaotic will summoning ancient beasts to besiege Su Yu and his group!

From the depths of chaos, the roars of giant beasts continued to echo!

This indicated that powerful ancient beasts might appear to attack Su Yu and his group. Should they be stopped?

…

Su Yu, who was leading his group closer to the lair of the Control King, felt his bracelet vibrate and quickly received a message from Lantian.

One had to admit, the Lantian-brand communication system was incredibly effective!

Even in chaos, there was no need to set up any communication system; messages could be sent directly.

Su Yu looked ahead at Yue Hao, who was flying towards them, and then at Yue Luo and her group pursuing them from behind. The next moment, he steeled his heart and transmitted, "Giant Bamboo, Xuelan, are you interested in exploding your Great Dao for fun?"

"…"

The two Heavenly Kings were shocked!

Su Yu quickly said, "Explode your Great Dao and merge into my world. Right now, I don't recommend Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables to merge, as it won't enhance your strength! However, if necessary, you can try merging! You two self-destruct your Great Dao and then find a similar Great Dao to master… the comprehension of the Great Dao remains, and there's hope to become a Heavenly Venerable… well, a pseudo-Heavenly Venerable!"

The strength might not increase, but it wouldn't decrease either.

It was just transitioning from a true path to Su Yu's path.

For Heavenly Venerables, Su Yu didn't recommend merging now; it was pointless and might even weaken their strength. But for Heavenly Kings, it was about time.

As for Tongtian, he was special, and Su Yu wouldn't ask him to merge into his world.

Marquis Giant Bamboo's voice quickly came from March's hand, "I obey Your Majesty's command!"

Goodness, truly obedient!

As for Xuelan, who had refused once before, she hesitated for a moment and quickly transmitted, "I obey!"

This time, she didn't refuse again.

Because she knew that due to the previous incident, she couldn't integrate into Su Yu's circle.

Perhaps… merging into Su Yu's world now was a good way to mend fences.

The power of ice and snow in Su Yu's world was still unclaimed.

And her power of ice and snow was actually controlled by her mother, the Snow King, so even if she became a Heavenly Venerable, it was difficult to become a ruler of laws unless her mother perished.

The two Heavenly Kings instantly agreed!

Su Yu didn't hesitate and transmitted, "Listen carefully to my words. When I say 'self-destruct,' don't explode! When I say 'explode,' then you explode. Got it?"

"Understood!"

The two powerful figures quickly replied.

Afraid of missing a single word!

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly turned back, roaring, his aura fluctuating, "Self-destruct!"

Behind them, Yue Luo and her group, who had just caught up, quickly stopped.

But they watched helplessly as Su Yu and his group continued to charge towards the lair, leaving them both embarrassed and angry!

Tricked again!

Damn!

The powerful figure wielding the giant axe roared, "Don't stop! They won't self-destruct!"

Damn it!

Every time, they hesitated because of the threat of self-destruction. Just as they were about to catch up and surround them, they escaped again. This feeling was too frustrating!

Furious!

Yue Luo and her group had expressions that fluctuated unpredictably.

This beast Su Yu kept playing them over and over.

The next moment, Moon Luo shouted urgently, "Attack! Don't stop! Supreme Boron Dragon, Yue Hao, block them!"

"Self-destruct!"

Su Yu roared again, suddenly turning to charge at Moon Luo and his group, his aura fluctuating wildly as if he was about to self-destruct. Not just him, but several others also turned back, rushing forward with a look of determination to perish together.

Even though it seemed... highly unlikely, Moon Luo and his group couldn't help but retreat once more.

"Hahaha!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, then turned and ran, with the March group following closely behind.

At this moment, Moon Luo and his companions were driven to madness!

In the next second, Moon Luo shouted in fury, "No one is allowed to retreat anymore!"

Beasts!

It was infuriating!

Su Yu's side was far weaker than theirs, yet they had managed to scare them off multiple times with fake self-destructs!

...

"Self-destruct!"

Su Yu shouted again, but this time, no one backed down.

Su Yu cursed loudly, "Do you believe we'll really self-destruct? Damn it, can't handle it, huh? If you don't retreat, I'll really blow myself up!"

No one paid him any mind!

Go to hell!

Blow yourself up!

The next moment, Su Yu pointed at the Boron Dragon Beast blocking the way and shouted, "Move aside, or I'll blow you to pieces!"

The Boron Dragon Beast couldn't be bothered to respond!

I'm just a projection. Even if you do self-destruct, you shouldn't be targeting me. You should be blowing up others. Are you crazy? Why would I care if you self-destruct or not?

Su Yu threw a punch at the Boron Dragon Beast, and the March group rushed forward.

They wanted to force the opponent back!

But the Boron Dragon Beast showed no intention of retreating.

It was determined to block them for a while!

Previously, it had been the one intercepting them, but Moon Luo and his group had messed it up, getting scared off by Su Yu and his group.

This time, the Boron Dragon Beast believed that if Moon Luo and his group didn't retreat, intercepting these people and killing them wouldn't be too difficult.

"Explode!"

Su Yu shouted fiercely!

But after hearing too many false threats, no one believed him anymore.

However, Xuelan and Marquis Giant Bamboo had been listening intently all along.

The words were different!

This time, it was a real explosion!

In an instant, Marquis Giant Bamboo and Xuelan's Great Dao shattered. They had been in this tense state, pretending to self-destruct, and now, no one else believed it!

Su Yu demanded a true self-destruction of the Great Dao!

Boom!

Two Heavenly King Daos exploded simultaneously, and a powerful force surged out instantly, boom!

A loud explosion echoed through the heavens and earth!

"Through the Heavens!"

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian's eyes widened—an opportunity!

At this moment, the Boron Dragon Beast was blasted into pieces, its willpower scattered.

It wasn't dead!

The Boron Dragon Beast was merely a projection of willpower, not its true form, but it had six portals within!

Now, the six portals trembled violently!

Among them, three Heavenly King portals even showed signs of cracking, and Marquis Tongtian seized the opportunity, roaring madly, transforming into a portal, and swallowing the three Heavenly King portals into his own!

The other three Heavenly Sovereign portals were a bit too much for Tongtian to handle, but... damn it, they were too tempting!

His sly face showed a hint of madness.

With a fierce shout, "Ah! I can't live anymore!"

Boom!

A massive portal directly swallowed one Heavenly Sovereign portal, while the remaining two portals fled instantly!

Rumble!

Tongtian was blasted sky-high, the four portals struggling fiercely within him, fluctuating. The three Heavenly King portals were suppressed in the blink of an eye, boom!

A loud explosion resounded!

Behind, the three Heavenly Kings suddenly had their foreheads burst open, crying out in pain!

The Gate of Hell had shattered!

And the Heavenly Sovereign portal belonged to the white-haired elder, whose face changed drastically. The next moment, with a loud boom, his forehead also burst open!

As Marquis Tongtian emerged, he opened his mouth, a torrent of power gushing out. He was somewhat injured, looking a bit pale. Su Yu ignored him, quickly grabbing the heavily injured Marquis Giant Bamboo and Xuelan, tossing them into his mouth, and transmitted, "Go, quickly, take them back to fuse the Dao, bring the items to Hongmeng!"

"Your Majesty, take care!"

Tongtian dared not delay. He was injured and needed to recover, escape!

In the blink of an eye, the portal flickered, and Tongtian fled with the two injured individuals!

Meanwhile, Su Yu and his group had already acted together, a thunderous explosion resounding as they shattered the Boron Dragon Beast into pieces. Fat Ball swallowed it whole, devouring all the willpower!

Without the support of the portals, this guy's willpower was just a big piece of fat meat, and Fat Ball couldn't be happier eating it!

In an instant, the Boron Dragon Beast projection was finished!

And on Su Yu's side, the three Heavenly Kings vanished!
