Chapter 706: The Control King's Lineage

Within Chaos Mountain.

Su Yu named this small hill Dao Origin Mountain, the beginning of the Great Dao. Although the name was grand, in reality, it was just an ordinary hill among thousands. Its only peculiarity lay in the grand formation that shielded it from the power of chaos.

At this moment, Su Yu was exploring Dao Origin Mountain with the Great Ming King. He aimed to trace the source and locate the core of this shielding formation. If it was indeed a formation, once the Great Ming King learned it, they could set up similar formations on other unoccupied hills, turning this place into a stronghold for the Human Race. The myriad races would be suppressed upon arrival. If it wasn't a formation but a treasure, finding it would still be beneficial, as it could be taken away at any time.

Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate, continuously probing along the shielding power. The Great Ming King followed closely, trying to determine whether it was a formation, and if so, whether it was man-made or natural. As a Daofuse Realm expert in formations, the Great Ming King had some skill. After following Su Yu for a while, his expression grew increasingly grim.

Finally, seeing that Su Yu had yet to find the source, the Great Ming King spoke solemnly, "Emperor Yu, I have something to say."

"What is it?"

"This might be a formation, but it likely uses some treasure as its foundation."

Su Yu nodded slightly. The Great Ming King took a deep breath and continued, "The key isn't just that. The formation seems familiar to me."

"Familiar?"

"Yes!" The Great Ming King exhaled, "Familiar. When I reached the Daofuse Realm, it was thanks to a shielding formation left by someone from the Control King's lineage. Their skill in formations was average, but the formations they set up were strong because they were standardized! They might only know this one formation, taught to them by someone else, and they know how to set it up..."

Su Yu's expression shifted.

The Great Ming King added, "The formation here increasingly resembles that shielding formation, though there are some differences. But the core principles seem to be from the same system."

Su Yu said solemnly, "Are you suggesting this might be a formation set up by the Control King's lineage?"

"Yes, didn't the Control King say they had been here before?"

The Great Ming King said gravely, "I'm wondering if this was left by the Control King. If it was, that's fine. If not... it means there are still strong individuals from the Control King's lineage, and they might be living in Chaos Mountain!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered.

The Great Ming King continued, "We all say the Control King's lineage betrayed us, but in the Upper Realm, there are still four human forces, and the Shadow Marquis doesn't even count among them. Four is very few!"

"Marquis Zhennan, Marquis Huoyun, Marquis Yunshui, and General Yingwu. If the Control King's lineage is truly hidden among these people, it's too conspicuous..."

Su Yu pondered, and the Great Ming King continued, "So, I'm thinking, is the Control King's lineage really among these people? If not, where are they?"

"Also, as traitors, I think appearing alone is too abrupt."

The Great Ming King said solemnly, "Emperor Yu, do you think it's possible that if this lineage truly exists, and if they can establish a base in a dangerous place like Chaos Mountain, there might be a large number of humans being sheltered by them, or perhaps some humans who escaped long ago and their descendants are actually living in Chaos Mountain?"

Su Yu frowned again.

The Great Ming King continued, "As traitors, what is the Control King's lineage's goal? Is it to exterminate the Human Race, or simply to prevent the Culture King and others from returning, or to unify the Human Race?"

Su Yu fell into deep thought.

After a while, he slowly said, "So, Great Ming King, you mean that if the Control King's lineage truly exists, and their goal isn't to exterminate the Human Race, they might have secretly cultivated a group of human experts who have been hiding in Chaos Mountain all this time!"

Su Yu's eyes gleamed with a peculiar light. "This place is chaotic, but if they can truly carve out a pure land, the myriad races wouldn't dare come, and humans couldn't reach it. Cultivating to the Sunmoon Realm here would be no problem; the source qi is too abundant. The only issue is that proving the Dao is too difficult..."

"Proving the Dao is difficult... but, Emperor Yu, is it necessary to prove the Dao?"

Su Yu was taken aback, and the Great Ming King continued, "Have the ancient beasts proven the Dao?"

Su Yu frowned, "You mean..."

"Simply strengthening the physical body, or even following the chaotic path of chaos!"

The Great Ming King said solemnly, "If that's the case, progress wouldn't be slow, and their strength wouldn't be weak! Cultivating the power of laws isn't the only path! If it doesn't work, they could cultivate to the peak of the Sunmoon Realm here and then find a place to prove the Dao."

The Great Ming King took a deep breath, "Now, the only thing we need to clarify is what the Control King's lineage's goal is. If it's to exterminate the Human Race, then what I'm saying doesn't exist. If not... then it's possible!"

He sensed the barely perceptible shielding power and said solemnly, "I think this formation might not have been set up by the Control King because... it's too peripheral!"

"Even if the Control King did come to guard, they wouldn't set up a formation on a small hill on the periphery. This hill seems more like an experiment."

"The strong individuals from the Control King's lineage might have conducted an experiment here, setting up a formation to shield against the influence of chaos!"

At this moment, the Great Ming King, through the formation, analyzed many things.

And Su Yu also fell into deep thought.

The Great Ming King continued, "If that's the case, then the humans outside are actually pawns! The Control King's lineage used the humans outside to attract the attention of the myriad races, and these people were all abandoned!"

"And their lineage might have absorbed many strong individuals or cultivated many strong individuals."

The Great Ming King looked at Su Yu, "This lineage betrayed us from the start! According to Emperor Yu, they wanted to kill the descendants of the Battle King lineage and eradicate the Culture King's pen dao inheritance from the start! Clearly, they knew of the pen dao's existence and didn't want it to reappear in the world! They didn't betray us at the start of the last tide; it wasn't until this tide that we discovered a hint... what were they doing for the previous 90,000 years?"

"Why do so few people know that this lineage betrayed us?"

Su Yu looked at him, and the Great Ming King chuckled, "This means that for the previous 90,000 years, they might have been hiding, always in the shadows, not necessarily having many people emerge, but always cultivating their own forces!"

"Occupying a treasure land like Chaos Mountain, at least resources aren't lacking. The Upper Realm is actually easy to comprehend the Dao. If the Control King's lineage's inheritance is continuous, I wouldn't say they have more Daofuse Realm experts than the entire Human Race, but in the last tide, the Human Race had nearly a hundred Daofuse Realm experts. What about the Control King's lineage?"

"This is a complete inheritance left by a Four Extremes Heavenly King, and even the Demon Emperor left one... two top-tier experts. I think their foundation might be deeper than those of the large clans like the Immortals and Gods!"

"The Control King even knew there would be a day of ancient extinction, and he might have been the one to secretly initiate it. If that's the case, wouldn't his preparations be fewer than those of the various races?"

"Emperor Yu, we've always considered the Control King's lineage as a branch of the Human Race, but we were wrong. We should consider them a race, an extremely powerful race, with two top-tier existences, second only to the Human Race if we divide it according to ancient times!"

Su Yu was internally shaken.

He looked at the Great Ming King, speechless for a long time.

Yes, he had always thought that the Control King's lineage's betrayal was just a branch of the Human Race. How many people could this lineage have?

Ten?

Twenty?

But now, the Great Ming King told him that perhaps they weren't just a branch, but a race!

The Control King and that ancient Demon Emperor, that alone made two top-tier existences, deeper than the foundations of the Immortal and God races.

If this chaos was initiated by the Control King.

Even the passive ones like the Human Emperor left many preparations, what about the Control King?

Su Yu's expression changed repeatedly. A single West King's Consort was a Heavenly King Realm existence. Su Yu previously thought that the West King's Consort might be the strongest existence in this lineage, but now, was that really the case?

If she were the strongest existence, would they leave her in the Lower Realm just to use her as a spy?

The Great Ming King also had some associations through this formation.

Because before this, everyone thought that the Control King's lineage was hiding among the remaining humans.

But looking at the situation of Marquis Dingjun, it was too tragic!

With just a thousand people, could there really be strong individuals hiding among them?

If their eyes weren't blind, they could find them one by one, investigate them one by one, and it wouldn't be difficult.

If the other four human Daofuse Realm experts each had ten thousand people under them, that would be forty to fifty thousand people.

Is that a lot?

Very few!

With so few people, hiding strong individuals would be too easy to discover and too easy to expose.

And the Great Ming King judged that the formation came from the Control King's lineage, and this place was Chaos Mountain, so everything might have an explanation.

The Control King once sat here for a thousand years, and the Control King's lineage couldn't be unaware of this.

This place is extremely dangerous, but also extremely safe.

Likewise, extremely secretive!

Because without necessity, neither the myriad races nor the Human Race would come here, almost courting death.

The Great Ming King continued, "Or, they placed some people in various forces, but I think that might be only a few. More people are likely hidden in Chaos Mountain, provided this formation was set up by them!"

With this shielding formation, they could avoid being crushed by the power of chaos, allowing the weak to survive.

Moreover, they wouldn't be easily discovered by ancient beasts.

If the formation were stronger, the ancient beasts probably wouldn't even see their existence.

The West King's Consort's shielding formation was very powerful.

Two Daofuse Realm experts fought, and the myriad races didn't notice any commotion.

The core of the formation had yet to be found, and Su Yu was feeling a bit of a headache from what the Great Ming King had said. He spoke in a deep voice, "According to the Great Ming King's theory, this lineage might indeed have formed its own faction! You're right; with the bloodlines of the Control King and the Flame Demon Emperor, these are two incredibly formidable existences..."

As he spoke, Su Yu suddenly asked, "The Flame Demon Emperor... Is this Demon Emperor from the ancient times?"

Was the Demon Emperor from ancient times called the Flame Demon? Su Yu hadn't really paid much attention to this, as the ancient era had long vanished, and the names of these powerful figures were rarely mentioned.

"Probably," the Great Ming King replied casually. "These powerful figures, their names are seldom mentioned. Just like us, we don't even know what the Human Emperor is called, or the names of the Four Extremes Human Kings. We're not too clear on that."

I know that the Martial King is called Zhou Taishan. As for the others, to be honest, I really don't know. They're all just honorifics!

Su Yu frowned, "Let's not worry about that for now. So, according to the Great Ming King's deduction, if... if the Control King's lineage is a race, then this race's strength might be even greater than that of the Immortals, Demons, and Gods! Yet, for a hundred thousand years, they haven't shown themselves, only making small moves in secret..."

"Not small at all!" the Great Ming King said solemnly. "If they orchestrated the last tide, then the Human Race and the myriad races combined lost nearly 150 Daofuse Realm experts in battle! Is that a small move? Not at all! Perhaps before, they didn't have the strength to conquer the entire Myriad Realms, but after the last tide, they might have accumulated enough strength!"

Su Yu inhaled sharply, "Damn, are you saying that this race might have accumulated enough strength to rival the current myriad races?"

"It's not impossible!" The Great Ming King looked towards the depths of Chaos Mountain, frowning. "This place is dangerous, but it also has many treasures! Others can't enter; it's all their territory. Over countless years, without needing to go out and fight, accumulating strength here... How terrifying could that be?"

"Just sending out a few people could stir up a storm."

"The West King's Consort is powerful, but during the first nine tides, she didn't make any moves. Only after the ninth tide did she go to the Death Realm to contact the West Heavenly King and the others. Why didn't she contact them before?"

"Because they felt that during the first nine tides, the various factions were too strong, and it wasn't suitable to reveal themselves. But after the ninth tide ended, they might have felt that their strength was sufficient!"

The Great Ming King analyzed with precision. He was originally a cultured scholar and a deeply strategic veteran. He managed to hide his son for hundreds of years, so well that no one knew until he had proven his Dao. He even fooled the myriad races into thinking his eldest son was dead. This man was no simple figure. It was only because of Su Yu's rise and the subsequent assistance he provided to the Great Qin King and others, allowing them to quickly reach the Daofuse Realm, that the Great Ming King appeared more low-key.

In reality, he was the only one in this tide who truly reached the Daofuse Realm on his own.

Yes, the only one!

The Great Zhou King wasn't from this tide, and Blue Sky and Wan Tiansheng opened their own paths, so there's no concept of Daofuse for them. Tian Yue wasn't from this tide either, and the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King are now following the path of the Desolate Beast. Only this one, relying on the West King's Consort's formation, stepped into the Daofuse Realm of formations.

Su Yu glanced at him with a peculiar expression. This man was indeed tight-lipped. Su Yu strongly suspected that the Great Ming King might have had these suspicions before but kept them to himself. It was only now, upon discovering issues with the formation, that he revealed everything to Su Yu.

No wonder he's Zhu Tiandao's father! Even someone as shrewd as Marquis Xia suffered losses at Zhu Tiandao's hands time and again. The Great Ming Prefecture was full of clever people. After fighting for over 400 years, not many from the Great Ming Prefecture died, yet their strength wasn't weak. Among the older generation of experts, the Great Ming Prefecture probably retained the most. Now, the prefecture had four Eternals, no, three Eternals and one Daofuse Realm expert.

Such strength was no less than that of the Great Zhou Prefecture or the Great Xia Prefecture.

Seeing Su Yu looking at him, the Great Ming King smiled, "What's the matter?"

Why are you looking at me?

Did I say something wrong?

It's just a reasonable deduction. Why is he staring at me like that?

Is there something on my face?

Su Yu smiled and suddenly said, "Great Ming King, I have a question for you."

"Please, Emperor Yu."

"Back then, Senior Xia Chen and the Great Zhou King both opened a relic for you. Only the Great Ming Prefecture had two relics, while the other prefectures had one each. Why didn't the Great Ming King give the relic to Principal Niu, who had a better chance of proving the Dao, but instead gave it to Zhu Tianfang?"

The Great Ming King chuckled awkwardly, "Well... cough, Old Niu was quite famous at the time. If he proved the Dao, everyone would know. Having one more Eternal on the surface didn't mean much. After Zhu Tianfang proved the Dao, he took charge of the Yellow Division of the Hunting Heaven Pavilion. The Yellow Division is the source of information for the Hunting Heaven Pavilion... To be honest, the Human Race's losses over the years haven't been great, and we've won eight out of ten battles, largely thanks to Tianfang."

He began to praise his son, smiling, "Tianfang manages the intelligence system. Emperor Yu is also a skilled warrior and understands the importance of intelligence! Without the Hunting Heaven Pavilion providing us with timely intelligence, the Human Race might not have been able to hold on until now, nor would we have been able to establish a foothold in the later stages."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

The Great Ming King continued, "Moreover, the Great Ming Prefecture is just low-key, not that its contributions are less than those of the Great Qin or Great Xia. On the contrary, in my view, the Great Ming Prefecture's contributions are even greater!"

The Great Ming King smiled, "Not to mention, in the wars across the Myriad Realms, thirty percent of the military equipment from the major prefectures came from the Great Ming Prefecture! Are the weapons crafted by those brutes stronger than those from the Great Ming Prefecture?"

"Our Great Ming Prefecture has the Hundred Dao Pavilion, capable of mass-producing various mid- to low-level weapon forgers. The Great Ming Prefecture has the most weapon forgers in the Human Realm!"

Su Yu nodded again. It did have a somewhat standardized production of weapon forgers.

He had entered it himself and knew that as long as you had talent in this area, you could become a weapon forger without consuming raw materials. Not only weapon forgers, but other professions as well.

Mass production!

Of course, those mass-produced were generally not refined, but for standardized production of military equipment, it was sufficient.

The Great Ming King chuckled, "Not only that, but our Great Ming Prefecture has also made significant contributions in various other industries! For example, storage rings are actually produced in the Great Ming Prefecture! There aren't many, but they're enough!"

"For example, many of the low-end techniques popular in the market actually originate from the Great Ming Prefecture!"

"Food, clothing, housing, and transportation... all these things are promoted by the Great Ming Prefecture. Emperor Yu, to speak honestly, without the Great Ming Prefecture, the Human Race would still be living like primitives. It was only after the Great Ming Prefecture that they gradually began to live like they do now!"

The Great Ming King chuckled, "Sometimes, those skilled in battle don't have glorious achievements. It's not just about how many people you've killed that makes you formidable! Among the Four Extremes Human Kings, my ancestor had the smallest reputation, but that doesn't mean my ancestor didn't contribute to the ancient times. Otherwise, just based on strength, could he have become one of the Four Extremes Human Kings? As far as I know, my ancestor was responsible for logistics back then. In the ancient wars across the Myriad Realms, the front lines relied entirely on my ancestor for support!"

Su Yu smiled, "So, what the Great Ming King means is..."

The Great Ming King also smiled, "Cough, cough, nothing much. What I mean is, the Xia family are a bunch of brutes. They're good at fighting but not at working! After we conquer the world, let my Zhu family handle the logistics. We'll definitely do a better job than the Xia family!"

"......"

Su Yu couldn't help but laugh!

Seeing him laugh, the Great Ming King immediately said, "I wasn't lying! Emperor Yu, you've lived in both the Great Ming Prefecture and the Great Xia Prefecture. Which do you think is wealthier, the Great Xia Prefecture or the Great Ming Prefecture? Which is more peaceful, the Great Xia Prefecture or the Great Ming Prefecture? Why should the common people be so warlike? Everyone should just do their jobs! Complete military control, like in the Great Qin Prefecture, isn't necessarily a good thing..."

"Take the Great Xia Prefecture, for example. Does a cultured scholar have enough funding to conduct research?"

"In the Great Ming Prefecture, even if you're as unreliable as Hu Xiansheng, just a mere Shanhai Realm, researching space transmission, the Great Ming Prefecture still supports you vigorously."

The Great Ming King chuckled, "In our Great Ming Prefecture, we eat, play, drink, and have fun, yet our contributions are no less than those of the major prefectures. Look at the Great Xia and Great Qin, living in bitterness and hatred, leading miserable lives, yet they haven't conquered much territory!"

"......"

There was no way to refute that.

Su Yu himself had lived in the Great Ming Prefecture for a while, and it was indeed quite enjoyable.

Eating, drinking, and having fun were all at one's leisure.

Various new things were constantly emerging.

Su Yu smiled, "The Great Ming King makes a good point. Cultivation isn't just about killing. Let's set that aside for now. According to the Great Ming King's thoughts, the Control King's lineage might be in this Chaos Mountain?"

"Highly likely!" The Great Ming King nodded. "Otherwise, in other places, with so many experts in the Upper Realm, it's impossible for them not to have discovered anything, unless they're all hidden within the forces of a few Human Race marquises, which is unlikely."

Su Yu also nodded slightly, glancing at the depths of Chaos Mountain. He exhaled lightly, "Interesting. I had overlooked this before, or rather, neither the myriad races nor the Human Race had considered this. In everyone's view, the Control King's lineage might be like the other three kings' legacies, either extinct or assimilated into the masses."

Thinking of this, Su Yu smiled and quickly said, "Wait for me a moment. I'm going to stir up the West King's Consort."

"......"

The Great Ming King was speechless, having forgotten about that.

Su Yu didn't delay. He indeed needed to make a judgment, one he hadn't considered before.

In Su Yu's fixed impression, the Control King's lineage existed in the Upper Realm, within the forces of people like Marquis Huoyun, perhaps just three or five people, hidden deeply.

He hadn't considered that if this lineage was so powerful, why would they hide at all?

Why hide among these people?

Why make things difficult for themselves?

A West King's Consort with the power of a Heavenly King—does such a figure still exist among the human race in the Upper Realm? Is there really a need for treachery and betrayal? If they truly wanted to annihilate them, they could simply dispatch a Heavenly King to their exact location and eliminate them, or even sell them out to the myriad races.

Perhaps the Control King's lineage hasn't actually betrayed Marquis Minshan and the others. They might need these people to stir up some chaos outside and continue fighting against the myriad races.

...

Inside the Mark of Civilization.

In a small space.

The West King's Consort was startled. Again? Su Yu had come quite quickly this time. Seeing Su Yu, she didn't bother with seduction and directly asked, "Where are we now? Why do I feel that the Great Dao I'm sealed in is somewhat suppressed?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "You can still sense the outside world?"

"Just a little," she replied with a light laugh, conjuring a bed and reclining on it. "Since the Human Lord is here, why not sit and chat?"

Su Yu, uninterested in her antics, conjured a chair and sat across from her, saying indifferently, "I've arranged for someone to send the items to the Upper Realm. However, the Fate Realm is heavily guarded, so it will take some time."

The West King's Consort chuckled, "What's the rush? The Hundred Battle King hasn't been unsealed yet."

Su Yu glanced at her coldly. "But there have been some recent messages from the Upper Realm that I need to verify with you."

"What doubts does the Human Lord have?" she asked with a seductive smile. "As long as it's something I can speak of, Ziyan will tell you everything. After all, we're on the same path now."

Su Yu sneered and quickly said, "Marquis Minshan is dead. Did you know?"

The West King's Consort frowned slightly. Su Yu hadn't mentioned this last time. She raised an eyebrow and smiled, "Dead is dead. What's so surprising about that?"

Su Yu's voice turned icy. "It was your lineage that did it! Although I don't think much of those old folks in the Upper Realm, you bastards have once again betrayed an ancient marquis. Sooner or later, I'll wipe out your entire lineage!"

The West King's Consort scoffed, "Don't blame everything on us! Minshan was a fool who died at the hands of the myriad races. Isn't that normal? Su Yu, you're ridiculous. There's always an excuse for failure..."

Su Yu slapped her, making her cough up blood and shattering the bed. He coldly said, "Don't act arrogant with me! Remember, you're a prisoner now!"

The West King's Consort silently stood up, conjured another bed, and sat on it with a faint smile. "You can only vent your anger on me. It seems you're quite upset. How about letting elder sister comfort you?"

Su Yu stared at her for a while before speaking again, "There's something else I need to ask you. During the recent chaos in the Lower Realm, when the Immortal Battle Marquis tried to descend, he was stopped by someone in the Upper Realm. This person was a human, extremely powerful, and mysterious like you. Dressed in black, they wielded chaotic power of laws with formidable strength..."

As he spoke, the West King's Consort remained silent, though her heart trembled slightly. However, in this space, Su Yu controlled everything, and she couldn't hide anything from him.

Su Yu frowned, "I asked the Great Zhou King and others, and they all said they didn't recognize this person. They aren't known among the human experts in the Upper Realm. You've been in the Upper Realm before; do you know who this person is?"

"The Upper Realm is vast, and there might be many hidden human experts. How would I know them all?" she retorted with a sneer. "It's laughable that you'd ask me."

Su Yu frowned, "Their attire was similar to when you came to kill Hongmeng..."

"Ha!" The West King's Consort laughed mockingly, "There are plenty of people in black robes. How ridiculous!"

Su Yu's voice turned cold, "If you keep this attitude, I'll kill you!"

The West King's Consort finally quieted down, her smile seductive. "So, there was quite a spectacle during the previous battle? That person could actually withstand the Immortal Battle Marquis, whose strength isn't weak..."

"Indeed. That's why I'm curious about who this person is. The Immortal Battle Marquis might have the power of a Heavenly King, so this person might too!"

Su Yu pondered, "Could they be a strong figure from your lineage?"

The West King's Consort laughed, "Why would someone from my lineage stop the Immortal Battle Marquis for you?"

"True!" Su Yu nodded. "That's why I'm uncertain! But this person's Dao is quite unique..."

Su Yu continued to frown, "It's a bit chaotic. I later sent people to investigate, and even the Immortal Clan doesn't know this person's origin... Could it be that there's still a human Heavenly King alive in the Upper Realm? If we could recruit them, even if the Hundred Battle King is released, they could help hold the line..."

The West King's Consort smiled, "Then go recruit them."

"Shut up!" Su Yu snapped. "I'm worried they might be a traitor from your lineage!"

The West King's Consort remained silent.

"Since you don't know either, let's set it aside for now."

Su Yu exhaled, "One last thing. I've forced out the location of the Upper Realm passage. I want to send someone up to see if my people can enter the Upper Realm first to scout the situation. The Marquis of Dingjun's people have agreed to meet at Chaos Mountain... But the Great Zhou King says that Chaos Mountain is full of ancient beasts and extremely dangerous. I'm worried the Marquis of Dingjun might be setting a trap for me."

Su Yu thought for a moment and added, "Even if I don't go personally, I'll send top experts... I'm worried about problems arising."

With a cold gaze, he continued, "So, after much thought, I want to meet with all the remaining human experts in the Upper Realm at Chaos Mountain. But... I want to incite a beast tide and wipe them out in one fell swoop!"

The West King's Consort's expression changed slightly.

Su Yu said solemnly, "However, I need your help. You have that shielding formation. I want to send the Great Qin King up, but I'm worried he might be killed. So, using your shielding formation might help avoid the beast tide..."

The West King's Consort replied calmly, "Those ancient beasts aren't something you can just incite. Do you think no one has thought of using a beast tide against their enemies? Often, they end up dead themselves!"

Su Yu sneered, "Nonsense. Do you think I'm an idiot? Of course, I know! However, the Great Qin King and others have inherited the Great Dao of the Desolate Beast. Strictly speaking, they're part of the ancient beasts. As far as I know, there is some connection among the ancient beasts. I want the Great Qin King to try. Maybe he can incite them... If not, I still have the corpse of the Desolate Beast. If I give it to the Great Qin King and he detonates it, do you think it could draw out the ancient beasts?"

This time, the West King's Consort truly changed color, though it quickly faded. She laughed, "You're truly insane and vicious! You actually want to trap and kill those humans in the Upper Realm... You're even more ruthless than my lineage! Su Yu, you say my lineage is despicable... I think you're the real villain!"

Su Yu coldly replied, "A man must be ruthless! If they don't support me, should I let them cause trouble for me? Also, I don't need your evaluation. I'm just asking if, with the shielding formation, one can hide and not be detected by the ancient beasts?"

The West King's Consort scoffed, "How could that be possible! You're overthinking it. Your plan is doomed to fail."

Su Yu frowned, "Really impossible? Last time we fought, almost no aura leaked out... Forget it, hand over the formation to me. I'll have someone study it. Whether it works or not, we'll try it. It doesn't cost you anything. Doesn't your lineage wish for the extinction of the human race? Fine, I'll wipe out all the humans in the Upper Realm!"

The West King's Consort said flatly, "I won't give it to you, Su Yu. That formation is a secret of my lineage. Don't even think about it!"

Su Yu's voice turned cold, "It's just a formation! It only conceals aura and doesn't have much offensive power. Teach it to my people, and I'll wipe out the humans in the Upper Realm. Doesn't that align with your wishes? Or is there someone from your lineage among the Marquis of Dingjun's people, and you don't want me to kill them?"

The West King's Consort remained silent, offering no explanation. In any case, she wouldn't give it! She couldn't give it! If she did, Su Yu, this madman, might really send people up to Chaos Mountain to incite a beast tide. Although the possibility was slim, according to Su Yu, he had the Desolate Beast's corpse. The Great Qin King and others did use the Desolate Beast's Great Dao last time. The Desolate Beast was also one of the ancient beasts. If its corpse exploded, would it cause chaos in Chaos Mountain? Hard to say! If it truly caused chaos, that would be a huge problem.

Therefore, the only thing the West King's Consort could do was not give Su Yu the formation. Su Yu wouldn't want the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, who supported him, to fall. This way, it could prevent all this from happening.

At this moment, Su Yu was extremely angry. He grabbed her neck, squeezing it until it creaked, and shouted, "You fool! Wiping out the humans in the Upper Realm only benefits your lineage, not harms it! It's just a formation. Why won't you give it?"

The West King's Consort coughed up blood, laughing, "Ancestral teachings, cannot be passed on. Killing me won't help."

"Dammit!" Su Yu was furious, but soon snorted coldly, "Even if you don't give it, it's fine. A formation to conceal aura isn't unique..."

The West King's Consort coughed up blood, laughing, "Don't delude yourself. It's impossible to succeed. The power of the Great Dao in Chaos Mountain is different from the Myriad Realms. Formations from the Myriad Realms will likely lose their effect there... You've opened the Heaven Gate, but you're not in the Upper Realm. If you were, you'd find that the power of laws there is suppressed. Stop dreaming!"

She laughed, "You don't have many Daofuse Realm combatants under your command. If you lose the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, you'll die sooner or later. Your death doesn't matter, but I don't want to be buried with you. I advise you to abandon this idea!"

"Moreover, if you truly wipe out the humans in the Upper Realm, and they're all dead, once the Upper Realm opens, you won't even have a chance to struggle..."

The West King's Consort chuckled softly, "Since you can send people to the Upper Realm, why not find a way to subdue them? After all, Hundred Battle King is still sealed, isn't he? This is your chance."

Su Yu frowned.

The West King's Consort continued with a smile, "Su Yu, don't think about killing all the time. If I hadn't been captured by you, I would have hoped for your death. But now, I wish for your survival. Otherwise, wouldn't I be in trouble?"

Su Yu glared at her for a moment before sneering, "Trying to manipulate me? I can't be bothered with you!"

With that, his figure vanished.

After he left, the West King's Consort exhaled lightly. Su Yu, that madman, actually intended to provoke a beast tide at Chaos Mountain. Could the corpse of a Desolate Beast really trigger it? She wasn't sure.

The West King's Consort felt a bit uneasy. Clearly, Su Yu had set his sights on Chaos Mountain. She hoped he would abandon this idea soon.

...

Outside, Su Yu's expression shifted slightly. The West King's Consort didn't want him to incite a beast tide at Chaos Mountain! Even when he claimed it was to eliminate the humans from the Upper Realm, she refused to give him the formation layout. The so-called ancestral teachings were just nonsense!

"What is she worried about? Is she concerned that the beast tide will affect the Control King's lineage?"

"If so, the Great Ming King's deduction might be correct. This lineage is indeed hiding among them!"

"When I mentioned a powerful figure capable of resisting the Immortal Battle Marquis, she wasn't surprised. That's a Heavenly King-level expert. Wouldn't it be shocking for the human race to have an unfamiliar Heavenly King-level expert? Yet, she didn't question it, only claiming not to know..."

"When I said Marquis Minshan was betrayed by her lineage, she denied it..."

Thoughts flickered through Su Yu's mind, and after a while, he was mostly certain. The Great Ming King's deduction was likely true. This lineage was indeed hiding in Chaos Mountain, and there were definitely Heavenly King-level experts among them. The West King's Consort believed the black-robed figure, which Su Yu had fabricated, was one of her kin, which was why she didn't reveal anything.

"I really want to kill her, devour her blood essence, and see her memories!"

At that moment, Su Yu truly considered killing the West King's Consort, but he knew that doing so might alert the Control King's lineage and make them wary.

...

The Great Ming King noticed Su Yu emerging, deep in thought, and didn't interrupt him. Only when Su Yu regained his senses did he ask, "How did it go?"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "The Great Ming King might be right. This lineage is likely in Chaos Mountain, and there are quite a few powerful figures, definitely including Heavenly King-level experts!"

The Great Ming King wasn't too surprised, as it was his own deduction. At this moment, he sighed, "They're planning to be the fisherman, aren't they? The myriad races and the human race have been fighting for years, and here they are, accumulating strength, slowly depleting the power of both sides, and then striking to seize control of the Myriad Realms... If that's the case, their ambition is not small!"

Su Yu's face was cold as he looked towards the depths of Chaos Mountain. After a while, he said, "If they weren't noticed, it would be fine. But now that they are, thinking they can reap the benefits as the fisherman won't be so easy!"

"This lineage must not have the absolute strength to control the Myriad Realms. Otherwise, they would have already made their move. They're still waiting. Since the West King's Consort went to contact the West King, it means their strength isn't enough! They might even hope for the Hundred Battle King to be unsealed and fight the myriad races again, depleting both sides' strength... If that's the case, then there's still time and opportunity!"

The Great Ming King nodded slightly, "That seems likely! But if so, staying here is quite dangerous."

"I know."

Su Yu nodded. However, this was the periphery, and the other side might have already abandoned it to avoid drawing attention, so the danger wasn't too great for now.

"Continue searching for the formation core, and put other matters aside for now. Also, don't disclose this information."

Su Yu instructed in a deep voice.

The Great Ming King nodded, not saying much. Spreading this information might not be beneficial. As for informing the myriad races, they might not believe it, and even if they did, it would require the right timing.
