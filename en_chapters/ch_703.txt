Chapter 703: Keep a Low Profile, Kill Less (Please Subscribe)

"Marquis?"

"Father?"

At this moment, both the white-haired elder and the daughter of Marquis Dingjun were puzzled. What was happening?

Marquis Dingjun did not speak. Instead, he quickly stood up, his expression grave. Countless life-and-death crises had taught him to never underestimate any warning of danger. The Human Race in the Upper Realm was different from the myriad races; they could not afford to be careless. A single mistake could lead to their demise.

"Be on guard!"

With a light shout from Marquis Dingjun, his voice echoed throughout the flower field. Instantly, those who had been meditating, chatting, sleeping, or eating were all startled awake. Over a thousand people quickly formed into groups. According to their usual formations, the elders stood on the outside, the young and strong in the middle, while the weaker children were stored within a weapon space. However, if the bearer of the weapon fell, it meant everyone inside would perish with no chance of escape. The identity of the weapon bearer was a secret, known to none, not even the marquis, as he needed to fight and would be the primary target of the myriad races.

The crowd was silent, vigilant, uneasy, and filled with despair, yet some were also numb and indifferent. They had been fleeing for too long. The Upper Realm was not as glorious as it seemed. Though it sounded prestigious, life was harsh, especially in the past 6,000 years. Previously, they could at least contend with the myriad races, but the new generation of powerhouses had never experienced such glory, only repeated despair and sorrow.

"It's happening again!"

Someone in the crowd muttered, with a hint of resignation and relief. This kind of alert had happened many times. Most of the time, the enemy did not arrive. However, the marquis was not at ease, so some people did not take it seriously. If the enemy truly came, they would fight to the death. Dying would be a relief; after all, from tens of thousands, only they remained.

Several Eternal Peak powerhouses quickly gathered around Marquis Dingjun. The white-haired elder was also at the peak, nearly reaching the Daofuse level. He hadn't fused with the Dao not because he couldn't, but because he hadn't had the opportunity. Fusing with the Dao would create a huge commotion, easily exposing them. Of course, if a great battle broke out and they were already exposed, then fusing with the Dao would be no problem.

At this moment, the white-haired elder was also fully focused, extremely vigilant. Had the marquis sensed a crisis?

Marquis Dingjun held a long spear, turned his head to his daughter, and said in a deep voice, "Go over there!"

He didn't put her away; it wasn't necessary. Though his daughter was only at the Sunmoon Realm, if she were to die, she should die in battle, not within the weapon space. The woman said nothing, quickly flying towards the thousand-man team. The group was vigilant and uneasy, all looking towards the sky. Was there a strong enemy?

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was surprised.

"It seems... we've been discovered!"

Su Yu was a bit taken aback. He didn't need to search one by one; he saw the flower where Marquis Dingjun was because, at this moment, there were faint traces of different Daos manifesting. Ordinary people couldn't see it, but it couldn't escape Su Yu's notice.

At this time, several people walked through the void, and the moonlight shone down, but before it could approach Su Yu and the others, it was swallowed by Lantian with a look of enjoyment.

"What a place, I want to refine a flower!"

He chuckled, wanting to become a flower. Since he was refining an avatar, he naturally wanted to follow the flower's Dao. The Dao of All Beings was highly compatible. At this moment, the moonlight, which was highly toxic to others, was a medium for Lantian to comprehend the power of the Dao. He wished he could absorb it all.

The Great Zhou King couldn't be bothered with him and said in a deep voice, "After all, he's an old general, chased for many years, his sense of crisis must be extremely keen! He may not have discovered us, but he certainly sensed some danger!"

Su Yu nodded.

The Great Zhou King continued, "What should we do now, attack directly?"

A direct attack would cause too much commotion. Moreover, this was the Bright Moon Flower Valley. If they alarmed the flowers here, although they weren't afraid, it would inevitably lead to a battle. These flowers were not weak. They might even unite to unleash Daofuse-level power. The danger of such places lay in these things.

Su Yu looked at the sky. Since they had already captured a Daofuse, dragging it out might cause problems. After a moment of contemplation, he exhaled and said, "If it doesn't work, we'll attack directly! After all, there's only one Daofuse! Of course, it's best if we can persuade him. If not... we'll take him down!"

"Alright!"

Taking down Marquis Dingjun wasn't a big problem; the key was to keep the commotion small.

"Go!"

With an order, a formation appeared instantly. The Great Ming King led the formation! A concealment formation! This was learned from the West King's Consort. The West King's Consort had provided the Great Ming King with excellent ideas, greatly advancing his formation skills. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to enter the Daofuse level.

The formation instantly covered the closed flower. At this moment, a long spear pierced the sky, emerging from the flower with an unstoppable momentum, filled with determination!

Marquis Dingjun roared, "Scatter and flee!"

It was over! The moment the formation covered them, he knew it might be the end. A Daofuse formation! The leader was a Daofuse, not to mention the others?

"Flee? Where to?"

A light laugh echoed, and in the next moment, countless figures appeared from all directions. Lantian laughed heartily, a powerful Lantian appearing, enchanting and seductive, "Little Dingjun, come play with me!"

Marquis Dingjun was shocked, exclaiming, "A Quasi-King?"

"No, more like a Heavenly King?"

Lantian giggled, slapping towards him. At the same time, the Great Zhou King said softly, "Marquis Dingjun, we're on the same side, don't act rashly. Everyone, calm down, we're all family, bear with it for a moment and listen to me."

Marquis Dingjun's eyes flickered slightly, but he quickly shook off the influence of the Dao! His heart was filled with horror again! Who were they? Another top-level Daofuse! Damn it, how many top powerhouses had come to kill him? Why hadn't he seen these people before? No, the second person to speak sounded familiar, but he couldn't recall who it was.

He was fine, but the thousand-man team was instantly bewildered, standing still, with expressions of pain and struggle. They knew what was happening, wanted to run, but the Great Zhou King's voice echoed in their ears. Don't move! Listen to him! Below the Eternal level, they had no power to resist. Even the Eternals could only struggle a few steps, almost wanting to lay down their weapons and not fight.

No! They were filled with despair, knowing they were under attack by peerless powerhouses. Not just one!

"Kill!"

Marquis Dingjun roared again. No, even if he knew he was outmatched, he couldn't give up. Kill! Fight their way out, even if they couldn't escape, they had to kill a Daofuse, or even use the power of the flower valley to break the formation, alarming the flowers in the Bright Moon Flower Valley, which were also strong.

Just as he thrust his spear to pierce Lantian's palm, suddenly, a white figure appeared.

"Impudent!"

A low shout shook the Dao, and Marquis Dingjun's vision blurred as he saw a giant stone hurtling towards him.

"Suppress!"

Su Yu's low shout accompanied the stone's attack. His Human Lord Seal might not suppress Marquis Dingjun, but if the small stone was used by the ancient Human Emperor, it might have some suppressive effect on these people.

Sure enough, boom! A loud noise echoed, Marquis Dingjun's Dao trembled, his entire body went numb, and in an instant, he was caught by Lantian, who crushed his armor with a crunch.

Pfft! A mouthful of blood spurted out, and Marquis Dingjun held his spear to kill again, but he was in despair. Just as he attacked, his vision blurred, and a white-haired man snatched the spear from his hand in an instant.

"Bold, to see the Emperor and not bow, yet dare to resist?"

A low shout shook Marquis Dingjun's Dao again. In an instant, countless Lantians transformed into a giant net, enveloping him. Lantian cackled, "A mere marquis, quite bold, to see Emperor Yu and not bow, yet dare to resist?"

"Emperor Yu?"

Marquis Dingjun's heart trembled. What? These people... seemed to be from the Human Race! The Human Race... where did they get these powerhouses? He hadn't had time to think deeply when suddenly, his heart was filled with terror, waves of shock rising, and he couldn't help but say, "Lord Culture King?"

At this moment, a pen appeared. Su Yu held the giant pen, instantly sketching countless divine characters, sealing the opponent. Marquis Dingjun instinctively withdrew some of his struggle. With confusion, shock, and disbelief, he asked, "Who are you?"

"Who are you!"

He shouted, "Who are you?"

The three powerhouses were all stronger than him. Outside, there was another Daofuse guarding the formation, four powerhouses in total. Where did they come from? He didn't recognize any of them!

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to explain. Capture first, talk later. Sealing power emanated from the pen dao, and in the blink of an eye, with Lantian's initial seal, Su Yu instantly sealed his Dao. Nearby, the Great Zhou King was constantly chanting something. The others were trapped by him, unable to move.

Su Yu's pen dao released sealing divine characters, quickly entering the bodies of those people, each strong individual being locked down. Soon, Su Yu reached out and grabbed the thousand people into his giant hand! These people were conscious but unable to resist, each showing expressions of unwillingness, anger, and fear. Who was this white-haired demon king? They didn't have Marquis Dingjun's keen eyes, only knowing that the attackers were terrifyingly powerful. Marquis Dingjun, so strong, was taken down instantly by them! Marquis Dingjun couldn't even match one of them! Impossible! Marquis Dingjun, even among Daofuse, wasn't weak. According to Su Yu's classification, he was a third-class Daofuse, first-class Heavenly King, second-class Daofuse peak, third-class was top-level Daofuse in ordinary terms! Yet, both Lantian and Su Yu could suppress Marquis Dingjun. At this moment, everyone was filled with despair.

Su Yu, however, frowned slightly, looking into the distance, furrowing his brows, "Not good, the commotion is a bit too big, troublesome!"

As he spoke, Su Yu cast a glance at the still-dazed Marquis Dingjun, frowning slightly. "Lantian, capture him and take him away! Marquis Dingjun, behave yourself!"

With that, he waved his hand, and several figures appeared. Marquis Dingjun was stunned. This...

"Magashi?"

He recognized this individual, a Daofuse expert from the Demon Race of the previous tide.

While he was still in shock, Su Yu struck out with his palm. Boom! A thunderous explosion resounded as the newly appeared Demon expert was shattered into pieces by Su Yu's palm strike. Along with him, three Eternal experts were also reduced to pulp. Su Yu's Mark of Civilization emerged, and the Demon page remained, devouring all four of them completely!

Boom!

In the sky, a dark cloud suddenly appeared. It wasn't a phenomenon of the rules but rather a violent upheaval caused by the fall of a top-tier expert, severing the Great Dao.

Su Yu had directly killed them!

He had slain a Daofuse expert and three Eternals, devouring everything from them. Su Yu was wary of trouble, fearing these individuals might carry something or possess bloodline powers that could lead others to track them down.

Upon arrival, it was best to keep a low profile. No need to capture them alive; killing them was enough. Killing was, in fact, a way to remain inconspicuous. Yes, that was it.

After eliminating a few individuals, Su Yu grabbed hold of over a thousand people with one hand, instantly storing them in his Mark of Civilization. With a bit of squeezing, they could fit.

"Burn!"

A towering flame erupted, scorching the heavens and the earth! The entire Flower Valley suddenly burst into flames, instantly incinerating some of the flowers.

The Great Zhou King and Lantian also took action, shattering all the flowers nearby, leaving no trace. The flames burned, erasing all traces of their presence.

The Great Ming King appeared, and the formation contracted rapidly. "Let's go quickly; it seems someone has sensed the commotion!"

"No rush, erase all traces, leave no scent behind!"

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry, avoiding mistakes in haste.

Soon, they cleared all traces, burning all the flowers nearby. The entire Bright Moon Flower Valley turned into a land of death.

Not stopping there, the Great Zhou King chuckled, a playful tone in his voice. "Old Zhu, leave the formation behind. Let's leave a little surprise for the ones who come later. Conceal the formation's aura."

The Great Ming King grimaced. "Formations cost money..."

"Stop whining!"

"Alright!"

The Great Ming King reluctantly set up the formation quickly. Seeing this, Su Yu also smiled, swiftly compressing power within the formation. Countless source qi was compressed by him, along with a large amount of the power of laws.

Over there, Lantian giggled, "I'll leave a clone to play with them, find the best opportunity, and blow them up..."

Saying this, he suddenly transformed into a flower, charred and incomplete, giggling, "They'll definitely come to search. Seeing only a withered flower left, they'll surely come... Hehehe, bury the formation in my clone!"

The others said nothing, quickly getting to work.

In the blink of an eye, the formation turned into a sphere, swallowed by Lantian's withered flower clone. His clone was soon buried underground, giggling, "How's the concealment? Make it a bit challenging so they take a while to find me, otherwise, it won't be realistic..."

Su Yu chuckled, nodding. Lantian was indeed good at these tricks.

If it were too easy to find, it wouldn't be convincing. By adding a bit of difficulty, it seemed more genuine.

Su Yu quickly captured Marquis Dingjun, smiling faintly. "Don't struggle, don't move, or else... I'll execute you as a traitor!"

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun was sealed, but he could still see and feel.

He was filled with shock, a mix of emotions, watching these individuals.

Four great experts!

They appeared and attacked him, then... killed a Daofuse expert from the Demon Race, and now seemed to be plotting against others.

All of them were humans!

Emperor Yu... Culture King... Lantian...

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun didn't know what to think. He was excited, yet confused, and a bit fearful.

Who can tell me what exactly is happening?

Are they humans?

If they are humans, why attack me?

If not humans, then... these individuals are clearly human, except for that Heavenly King-level guy, whom he couldn't discern.

Confused, uneasy, yet with a glimmer of hope.

He didn't dare to ask, didn't dare to speak, only silently waited.

At least, for now, these individuals didn't seem intent on killing him.

"Let's go!"

Su Yu called out, and soon, everyone gathered.

The Great Zhou King's character fluctuated, space tearing apart. Su Yu's small stone appeared, suppressing the spatial fluctuations.

With a smile, they instantly teleported away.

In the blink of an eye, they appeared millions of miles away, and the small stone in Su Yu's hand emitted waves, suppressing the spatial fluctuations from their recent teleportation.

The space quickly healed!

In this way, tracking them was impossible.

Here, they had gathered the most elite forces of the human race; it wasn't so easy to catch up with them.

...

Not long after they disappeared, several auras appeared, and soon, seven or eight figures arrived in the Flower Valley.

At this moment, the Flower Valley was already charred black.

Among this group, a powerful presence scanned the area, frowning and cursing, "Damn it, Magashi is dead! I told him not to alert the enemy, just to keep watch here, damn it!"

He believed Magashi must have alerted the enemy, discovered by Marquis Dingjun!

Damn it!

Damn fool, now those guys have escaped, and tracking them down will be difficult.

"Chase!"

"He took quite a few people with him. Even if he killed Magashi, escaping won't be easy. Maybe he's injured too!"

The leading expert was furious.

Damn it!

Damn it!

He searched everywhere but couldn't sense any fluctuations. In such a short time, they had escaped?

Could they be hiding nearby?

He quickly searched the surroundings, frowning slightly. Suddenly, his eyes changed; there seemed to be something alive below.

He struck the ground with his palm, and at this moment, a withered flower, charred black, appeared before them.

This top-tier expert's eyes flickered.

There's still a flower!

Perhaps it could be used to trace back time and see where that guy escaped to.

He quickly descended, and the others hurriedly followed. They didn't know where Marquis Dingjun had fled to, where to chase him!

First, check the situation.

"My lord, this Bright Moon Flower is still alive. Maybe it can trace back where Marquis Dingjun fled to..."

"Rubbish!"      The leader was furious. Did he need to be told?

Hindsight!

He grabbed the flower, and on it, a pair of eyes gradually appeared, filled with confusion and fear.

The leader couldn't be bothered to ask, wasting time.

As long as it's alive!

The power of laws fluctuated, tracing back time!

With something alive here, even if the area was obliterated, it wouldn't matter. Marquis Dingjun probably didn't have time to clean up the battlefield and missed this lucky surviving flower.

Time began to rewind.

And at that moment, the leader suddenly felt a surge of danger, his eyes changing. In an instant, he let out a low shout, breaking through the void to escape.

Boom!

A massive explosion echoed through the heavens and the earth, turning the entire Bright Moon Flower Valley into a black hole.

Rumble!

Among this group, besides the leader who was in the Daofuse Realm, there were seven others, two in the Daofuse Realm and five in the Eternal Realm.

A total of three Daofuse Realm and five Eternal Realm experts.

Accompanied by this earth-shattering explosion, the five Eternal Realm experts were directly blown to pieces, their Great Daos shattered!

And among the two Daofuse Realm experts, one had his physical body instantly obliterated, roaring in anger. Suddenly, another body appeared, the Three Body Method!

This one was clearly a post-ancient Daofuse expert, following the Three Body Method.

At this moment, it saved his life!

The explosion's power was immense, but it only lasted a moment. By the time his second body was blown to smithereens and the third body appeared, the explosion's power had dissipated. This expert, left with only one body, was pale-faced!

Filled with boundless terror!

He had almost died just like that!

And the other Daofuse expert who came with him was unlucky. That one was even stronger than him, following the Weapon Fusion Method, and was directly blown to death!

Indeed, sometimes it depended on luck, not strength.

At this moment, the Three Body Method proved to be much better at preserving life than the Weapon Fusion Method.

And the void cracked open, the top-tier expert who had just escaped had a grim expression. Suddenly, he roared in anger, "Who?"

It wasn't Marquis Dingjun!

He couldn't have created such a powerful explosion. This kind of powerful explosion, capable of evading his danger sense, must have been orchestrated by a top-tier existence!

Perhaps... even stronger than himself.

Don't be fooled by just an explosion; it involved too many things—concealing aura, compressing the power of laws, blocking danger sense, and there were issues with the flower itself.

This wasn't something that brute Marquis Dingjun could achieve, nor did he have the strength.

At this moment, this expert was both shocked and furious!

He couldn't pursue!

The opponent was likely stronger than himself.

Although he was close to second-tier Daofuse power, he knew the opponent was stronger. Otherwise, they couldn't have evaded his senses.

It wasn't Marquis Dingjun, definitely not!

He didn't pursue but quickly waved his hand. In the next moment, a huge golden firework blossomed in the void. Soon, powerful willpower rapidly spread in this direction.

Two Daofuse experts had fallen, along with that massive explosion, which had actually alarmed nearby experts.

"Baghaj, what happened?"

A strong presence appeared, looking down with some surprise and peculiarity. This... Bright Moon Flower Valley, it was said that Marquis Dingjun might be hiding here, and Baghaj seemed to be preparing to lead a siege. Did something go wrong?

The newcomers weren't from the Demon Race, and Baghaj was a Demon Race expert.

As for the Demon Race losing two Daofuse experts... they weren't particularly concerned. There was already a competitive relationship, so if they died, they died. What they were more interested in was, how did this happen?

Baghaj was also an ancient marquis!

A highly powerful existence, bringing several Daofuse experts, could he have been outsmarted by Marquis Dingjun?

Did that guy escape?

Impossible, right?

As the question was asked, more enormous faces gathered in the sky. Baju looked at them coldly and soon gritted his teeth, saying, "Something unexpected happened. It wasn't the Marquis of Dingjun; a powerful figure secretly assisted him! Moshiqi was killed in advance, and the other side left countless compressed power of laws here, which exploded!"

Everyone understood, wearing expressions of oddity. 

In other words, you were outsmarted!

This guy... truly unlucky.

Losing two Daofuse experts at once is a huge loss for any race. Soon, another colossal face appeared, carrying a hint of anger. "Baju, you useless thing, where are the people with the Marquis of Dingjun?"

A trace of anger appeared on Baju's face, but he suppressed his temper and quickly said, "Marquis of Bloodshed, when I arrived, they were already gone..."

"Useless!"

Marquis of Bloodshed!

At this moment, the other large faces all showed some peculiar expressions and quickly avoided this one.

This person was on par with the Marquis of Immortal War. Previously, they had fought for many years over a rule-based great path, and recently, it seemed the Marquis of Immortal War had won. This one was still carrying a grudge.

Today, the Demon Race lost two Daofuse experts again. It's already good that this one hasn't exploded in rage.

"Why aren't you chasing them!"

Marquis of Bloodshed was furious, "Do you want me to come in person and chase your ancestors?"

Anger!

This useless thing, although also an ancient marquis, was not taken seriously by the Marquis of Bloodshed. His true body was too far from here; otherwise, he would have already come to kill in person!

And Baju was just waiting here, waiting for what?

He was extremely annoyed!

Obviously afraid of death, but as an ancient marquis, it's not that easy to be killed. Now that the commotion is big, many powerful figures will soon arrive. You should chase first; otherwise, you won't catch anything later!

Baju's face showed some irritation.

The outsiders were still watching!

The Marquis of Bloodshed directly scolded him!

Despite his anger, he still said in a low voice, "I'll chase immediately, but the other side... might be much stronger than me!"

"Shut up, hurry!"

The Marquis of Bloodshed shouted angrily!

Baju said no more, gritting his teeth, and quickly traversed the void and disappeared.

Chase what?

When he arrived, the other side had already run away. Where to chase?

Forget it, just pick a direction and chase. At this moment, Baju was also constantly thinking, who could it be?

Who is helping the Marquis of Dingjun?

A strong human?

Among the few surviving strong humans, who has that strength?

The strongest, Marquis of Minshan, has already been killed. The remaining ones, even if stronger than the Marquis of Dingjun, are limited in strength. Unless they act together, how could they have such great power to instantly kill Moshiqi and create such a massive explosion?

"If not humans... could it be..."

One thought after another appeared in his mind, his eyes carrying a hint of ferocity.

If not humans, could it be the Iron Devourer Race or other strong races?

No, this clearly has a hint of a Culture Master's touch. The Iron Devourer Race and other strong races have many powerful figures, but this kind of concealment is more likely done by a Culture Master.

The Immortal Race?

The Immortal Race is most adept at these things.

With countless thoughts, he searched everywhere, but after a while, he felt powerless. He couldn't find anything!

Even if there were some traces before, they are gone now.

As for the Bright Moon Flower Valley, it was blown to pieces, probably nothing could be found there either.

"Damn it..."

He cursed in his heart. This time, the trouble was not small.

Two Daofuse experts died, and the Demon Race council might cause him trouble.

Unlucky!

He soon stopped chasing. If he chased too far and the Marquis of Bloodshed didn't come, what if he was ambushed and killed?

The expert who acted this time might be a peak Daofuse, or even a quasi-king?

He couldn't judge, but he couldn't chase anymore.

...

At the same time.

Near the Burial Soul Mountain, Su Yu looked into the distance. This place was extremely far from there, yet the rule fluctuations and the massive explosion sound, the scene of the Daofuse great path shattering, were all seen by Su Yu.

Su Yu revealed a smile, "Have they never suffered before? They actually got a Daofuse killed by an explosion... These idiots, do they have no sense of precaution?"

He was surprised.

He had only set some traps, thinking of blowing up some Eternals, but unexpectedly, he had an unexpected gain, blowing up a Daofuse!

Su Yu chuckled, "These people from the Upper Realm seem very foolish!"

The Great Zhou King also laughed, "No, they just didn't expect it. The Human Race has always been declining, only having the fate of running away. How dare they actively set traps to counterattack? Moreover... without Heavenly King combat power, it's hard to achieve these."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "That's true, but... still very foolish!"

Su Yu laughed, "A good start, not bad, killed two Daofuse, both from the Demon Race. I only killed one Marquis of Modang before, still had some regrets, but now it's fine!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "Next time, kill the God Race. The Immortal Race lost the Soldier King and the Marquis of Falling Star, but not a single one from the God Race has died!"

Su Yu also laughed, indeed.

The God Race... has good luck.

With that old imperial consort around, it's not easy to kill them. Last time, they didn't even send anyone down, making it even harder to kill.

The few chatted, while the captured Marquis of Dingjun was in a daze, muttering, "Two Daofuse died..."

Since when did Daofuse become so easy to kill?

The Upper Realm is foolish... the Lower Realm!

These people, from the Lower Realm!

He was filled with disbelief, with some anticipation, a bit nervous, and spoke out, "You... you are from the Lower Realm?"

The Great Zhou King looked at him and smiled, "You haven't recognized me yet?"

"You..."

The Marquis of Dingjun looked at him for a while, falling into memories, and after a long time, he said in shock, "You... you are Zhou Tiansheng?"

"Ahem, Zhou Tianqi!"

The Great Zhou King lightly coughed and smiled, but the Marquis of Dingjun shook his head, "No, you are Zhou Tiansheng, I remember... aren't you?"

"That was the name from the last tide, now it's Zhou Tianqi!"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Names, just code names!"

Anyway, he often changed names!

But the Marquis of Dingjun was extremely shocked, no longer caring about the name, "You... you are from the Lower Realm? How is that possible!"

He couldn't believe it!

These people, all from the Lower Realm?

They killed the Soldier King, the Marquis of Falling Star, the Marquis of Modang...

How many Daofuse have these people killed?

Are the people from the Lower Realm so powerful?

Even if this Zhou Tianqi is someone he knows, not from this tide, but the Lower Realm... when did it have quasi-king level experts?

And who is this white-haired youth?

At this moment, the Marquis of Dingjun's mind was in a mess!

Who can tell me what happened?

Sitting at home, suddenly captured, being captured is one thing, but suddenly two Demon Race Daofuse died, and then these people told him they were from the Lower Realm, the Lower Realm he imagined might be destroyed!

He's going crazy!

Why is the Lower Realm so strong?

And we were still thinking, the Lower Realm is not good, waiting for the Upper Realm to open, to save the Lower Realm, isn't that... isn't that a joke?

Su Yu was too lazy to say more, quickly said, "Let's go back first, maybe the myriad races will search next, there are many strong ones, only two Daofuse died, I see more than ten Daofuse appearing from all directions..."

Su Yu sighed, "The water in the Upper Realm is quite deep, not easy to deal with, let's go back first and plan long-term!"

"Yes!"

Several people responded, and under the shocked gaze of the Marquis of Dingjun, even that somewhat perverted quasi-king seemed very obedient, no more nonsense, quickly taking him and flying towards the depths of Burial Soul Mountain.

Emperor Yu?

He thought of the titles these people used before, thought of the pen he saw, with some uncertainty, with some excitement, suddenly said, "Is this... the Human Lord of this tide?"

Only then could it be explained!

Otherwise, there's no way to explain why these people would listen.

The Lower Realm, has another Human Lord been born in this tide?

Moreover, it seems not weak, at least slightly stronger than himself.

Of course, compared to the previous Human Lords, it seems weaker, and far inferior to the Hundred Battle King.

He just thought about it, and the Great Zhou King smiled, "Not the Human Lord."

The Marquis of Dingjun was stunned, not?

"He is the Human Emperor of this new era!"

The Marquis of Dingjun was shocked, "You... what nonsense are you talking about, you..."

The Great Zhou King smiled, "I am the Torchbearer, the first generation Torchbearer! Your son is considered my junior, my subordinate, don't question me, don't talk too much with me, understand?"

The Marquis of Dingjun was stunned, Torchbearer!

The first generation Torchbearer!

He looked at the Great Zhou King carefully, for a long time, with some confusion, some doubt, this Zhou Tiansheng, he had seen a few times in the last tide, but very low-key, only Eternal strength.

However, the other party is the first generation Torchbearer, obviously, he hid his strength.

Could it be that this generation's Human Lord was supported by him?

If so... then it can be understood.

Human Emperor?

Such a big tone, could it be that this Torchbearer intends to support this Emperor Yu to become some Human Emperor, controlling him behind the scenes?

In an instant, countless thoughts appeared in his mind.

And Su Yu, however, was very calm.

Lantian, on the other hand, seemed to know what the other party was thinking, chuckled, touched the Marquis of Dingjun's head, and under the somewhat angry gaze of the Marquis of Dingjun, Lantian smiled eerily, "Be good! I haven't killed a Human Marquis yet, don't become the first Human Marquis I kill, be obedient."

The Marquis of Dingjun felt a chill in his heart!

Seriously?

This one, is also the strongest he feels, stronger than the Torchbearer.

Lantian smiled eerily, Su Yu slightly frowned, "Don't scare the senior, all are humans, the senior has fought for the humans for many years, still an ancient marquis, don't lose etiquette!"

Lantian giggled, "Emperor Yu brother is right, don't scare him, leave it to the Great Zhou King, if he can't handle it, we'll scare the Great Zhou King, let him cut it and see."

The Great Zhou King was tired.

Seeing the Marquis of Dingjun looking at him, with some helplessness, he ignored it.

Don't look at me, I'm not the one in charge!

Have some insight, I'm here, I'm the target they suppress, the target they suppress, anyway, if there's something, it's the Great Zhou King's fault, if there's nothing, it's the remnants of the Hundred Battle King!

Where can I reason!

Supporting the Hundred Battle King, it's not me, I just think, the Hundred Battle King is powerful, can contribute to the humans.

Now it's good, those who supported the Hundred Battle King, you all appeared, I guess I'm out, right?

Chapter 720: The Arrival of the Marquis

The Great Zhou King couldn't be bothered to intervene. As long as the Marquis of Stabilization was sensible, there wouldn't be any major issues. Su Yu wouldn't kill an ancient human marquis without reason.

The Marquis of Stabilization, having lived countless years and evaded capture for so long, had a keen sense of judgment. At this moment, he was once again shaken. This Torchbearer... wasn't the leader of these people?

Just as he was pondering, they arrived at their destination.

In an instant, the Marquis of Stabilization saw more people, including some familiar faces. For instance, he recognized Grandstar. He knew these guardians; he had seen them many times over the years as they guarded the passageways.

"Emperor Yu!"

"Your Majesty!"

Voices rang out, filled with joy. Their demeanor caused the Marquis of Stabilization to tremble slightly. None of them paid attention to the quasi-king or the Torchbearer; all eyes were on the white-haired young man.

This... wasn't something a puppet Human Lord could achieve! It was known that in this place, Emperor Yu's strength was inferior to those two. Why was it like this?

The Marquis of Stabilization had countless questions but couldn't voice them. Meanwhile, he didn't notice Liu Shan and Du Bing on the side, their eyes wide and jaws dropped.

The marquis... had been captured!

Damn!

How long had it been?

He was really captured!

These people were terrifying!

At this moment, the two Eternals were nearly scared out of their wits. The marquis had been hiding in a dangerous place and was still captured. What about the marquis's subordinates? Their friends? Family? Were they dead or captured?

Su Yu, with a smile, casually said, "It's nothing. Don't all look at me. The Marquis of Stabilization has been captured, and we killed two Daofuse Realm demons along the way. Things should be quiet for a few days. The Upper Realm might be searching for us during this time!"

Grandstar chuckled, "Let them search. Are we afraid of them? I knew we'd have gains this time. Emperor Yu, when are we going to make it big?"

Su Yu laughed, "What's the rush? We just got here and don't understand the situation yet. Let's wait."

He glanced at the Marquis of Stabilization and casually tossed out a thousand people. "Keep them under watch for now. I don't want to say much. Great Zhou King, you have topics to discuss with them. Chat more, and bring the Marquis of Stabilization to see me later."

"Understood!"

The Great Zhou King responded, smiling at the Marquis of Stabilization.

At this moment, the Marquis of Stabilization gradually calmed down. He was serious and wanted to know what had happened in the lower realm. He also wanted to talk to this Torchbearer.

As for his subordinates, they were all suppressed and unable to move, each with a look of fear. Beside each of them stood someone, scrutinizing them, making them too scared to breathe.

"So many cute little treasures!"

Thousands of Blue Sky clones were laughing, all saying the same thing in different tones and voices, sending chills down everyone's spines.

"I really want to cherish these little treasures!"

Blue Sky continued, and the Great Ming King and others avoided him. Being near this guy was truly stressful.

The Marquis of Stabilization felt heavy-hearted and said in a deep voice, "Everyone... don't move recklessly, stay calm!"

He sensed that the humans from the lower realm didn't seem to have much respect for them. Except for this Torchbearer, who seemed somewhat kind, the others looked at them as if they were strangers, unrelated.

That look was one of detachment!

Yes, detachment.

Everyone knew that Su Yu wasn't fond of ancient humans or those from the Upper Realm. The Great Zhou King had been suppressed in the lower realm because of this. They dared not get involved with these people.

The Marquis of Stabilization also noticed an Iron Devourer Daofuse Realm expert, who was extremely low-key, staying far away from them as if afraid of getting involved, as if they were a big trouble.

It was known that the Iron Devourer Race in the Upper Realm had a good relationship with them. Why was it like this?

Countless thoughts flashed through the Marquis of Stabilization's mind again.

He looked at September, who felt uneasy under his gaze and suddenly said, "Don't look at me. I'm not familiar with you. Emperor Yu, my race is only familiar with you. I don't know this guy. He's deliberately looking at me!"

"…"

The Marquis of Stabilization was bewildered. Was it necessary to react like this just because I glanced at you?

Not far away, Su Yu chuckled, "Let him look. It's not like you'll lose a piece of flesh."

"Well... okay then!"

September felt pressured. Why look at me? I'm really not familiar with you!

Seriously!

He shuffled over to Xia Longwu and the others. Look if you want, but I won't pay attention to you!
