Chapter 843: Beyond the Heaven Gate

Great Zhou King was in a battle of wits and courage, a struggle Su Yu was unaware of at this moment. He didn’t know the choice Great Zhou King would make, but he understood that if the Human Emperor summoned his physical body, perhaps Great Zhou King could be seen upstream.

With Great Zhou King gone, would the Myriad Realms fall into chaos? Su Yu had prepared for this possibility. If something truly happened, and Great Zhou King chose the Human Emperor, Su Yu might choose to return to the Myriad Realms himself or send powerful allies back.

Everyone had their own choices to make. At the level of Su Yu, the Human Emperor, and even Great Zhou King, there was no absolute right or wrong. Protecting the human race, annihilating formidable foes, taking risks, or waiting for the right moment—all were valid choices.

Su Yu might not necessarily be right. Others might not necessarily be wrong. As long as they didn’t collude with the enemy or harm their own kind, their core beliefs were essentially aligned, differing only in approach.

Thus, Su Yu told Great Zhou King, “If you’re unwilling, then leave, go to the Human Emperor! Because I have my own choice.”

Perhaps the Human Emperor’s side was indeed more suitable for him. As the leader of the Human Emperor’s secret guards, protecting the Human Emperor was his duty. Similarly, if Su Yu’s own secret guard leader didn’t come to protect him, what use would the secret guards be?

Su Yu understood all this. Even when he left, he didn’t take Great Zhou King with him. He considered that Ren Mountain was still in the Upper Realm, and taking Great Zhou King away might not bring him peace.

At this moment, Su Yu was communicating with the Heaven Gate. He was attempting to leverage the power of the Heaven Gate. He had his own path, the path of the physical body, and he had left a mark in it. He wanted to see if he could borrow the power of a strong individual. Whether this individual would infiltrate, attempt to seize his body, or control him—it didn’t matter!

As an opener of the heavens, if he could be destroyed through the gate, that would be too pathetic. Su Yu hoped the entity within the Heaven Gate was a first-class being. He even wished he could contact a first-class being, and if their true form could emerge, that would be ideal. At a critical moment, throwing out a first-class being would be quite a spectacle!

Following the Human Emperor’s guidance, Su Yu continuously attempted to communicate with the Heaven Gate. He truly hoped to connect with a powerful entity. Not a weak one! Not a weak one! According to the Human Emperor, the first entity you communicate with is likely the one you’ll always communicate with. Don’t let it be a third or fourth class; such beings are too weak!

Even if there were many strong entities within the Heaven Gate, not all could be rulers of laws. Even so, third and fourth class were the mainstream. Second class, in any era, were considered strong.

The Heaven Gate hovered above his forehead. Su Yu continuously infused it with the power of the Great Dao, the power of the physical body’s Great Dao. According to the Human Emperor, the Great Dao he controlled might attract a strong entity near his Heaven Gate to sense his presence.

The path of the physical body, a foundational Great Dao, was actually not weak. However, the current path of the physical body lacked a true ruler of laws. Otherwise, whoever controlled the human race’s path of the physical body would undoubtedly be stronger than a first-class being!

He hoped that beyond the Heaven Gate, there was such an existence. If he could kill them one day, he could even fill his own world with their power.

Yes, Su Yu’s plan was simple: borrow power first, then find an opportunity to kill. If they wanted to emerge from the Heaven Gate, he would let them.

“I hope the shadow near my Heaven Gate doesn’t attract the Martial King,” Su Yu thought. It better not be the Martial King! Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to act against them. But the Martial King might not have the opportunity or time to respond to his summons. Judging by his and the Culture King’s situation, their days didn’t seem easy.

“The Martial King is definitely first-class, with at least 16 paths now! The Culture King is even stronger… which means there are many powerful beings within the Heaven Gate! Just give me a strong one with 16 to 18 paths!”

Too strong, and Su Yu couldn’t handle it yet. But if a 16 to 18 path being truly emerged, Su Yu had enough strong allies on his side to deal with them.

“Hurry and respond!” Su Yu was a bit anxious. Was his path of the physical body too weak to attract a strong entity?

He kept infusing the power of the Great Dao!

Gradually, Su Yu felt a faint connection. It was weak, but his heart stirred. Perhaps… someone was coming!

Someone from within the Heaven Gate!

This might be his next best method to understand the Heaven Gate!

As for the Human Emperor and the others… Su Yu strongly suspected that the strong entities they attracted had already been dealt with. With the Human Emperor’s strength, even if the Lord of the Undead was attracted, they wouldn’t stand a chance against him through the Heaven Gate.

Su Yu waited silently.

Moments later, in his perception, his Heaven Gate’s shadow seemed to tremble. The next moment, a faint willpower seemed to seep through, carrying a probing intent.

“Who are you?” Su Yu’s voice was low, his willpower vibrating!

Instantly, a powerful aura erupted, at least… fourth class!

Alright, a strong ruler of laws, even fourth class was a ruler of laws!

At this moment, with the power of the physical body’s Great Dao, Su Yu could barely unleash a fourth-class level of strength. Not bad, at least he was a hegemon-level existence.

At this moment, a faint willpower spread, circling near the Heaven Gate’s shadow, carrying a hint of majesty: “Who are you? Communicating with the Heaven Gate, do you know it’s forbidden to trespass? Such audacity!”

Su Yu’s eyes flickered rapidly!

Someone had come!

“Someone from within the Heaven Gate?”

Su Yu didn’t play dumb. Instead, he quickly and coldly said, “This Heaven Gate can actually summon someone from within. I thought it was just a legend, but it turns out to be true!”

A majestic voice echoed from the Heaven Gate’s shadow again: “Ignorant junior…”

“Shut up!”

Su Yu’s aura was formidable, his voice vibrating within the Heaven Gate’s shadow. He snorted coldly, “I am the Human Lord, the Emperor of the Tenth Tide! Who are you? State your name! I ascended to the ruler of laws at a young age. Old man, don’t try to act superior, or… don’t blame me for severing your will. A mere wandering willpower dares to challenge this emperor?”

Beyond the Heaven Gate, there seemed to be a slight pause.

Human Lord?

The Tenth Tide…

Su Yu didn’t know if they understood this concept, but it didn’t matter. If they didn’t understand, he could explain it to them. He was generous!

“The Human Lord of the Tenth Tide… interesting. Do you know Xingyu?”

Su Yu didn’t expect that the Human Emperor was famous even within the Heaven Gate. This meant that either the Human Emperor had interacted with them, or the existence of the Culture King and others had made them aware of such a powerful figure.

Su Yu sneered, “Nonsense! Ten thousand years ago, the Human Emperor of the ancient era! A peerless powerhouse who could traverse the heavens and the earth. How could this emperor not know? You know the Human Emperor too?”

“Human Emperor…”

From the other side, a voice faintly came, carrying a hint of amusement: “Do you know that the Human Emperor, whom you call a peerless powerhouse, is only equivalent to me? You, junior, have quite the audacity!”

After Xingyu, the Human Lord of ten thousand years later, seemed young. No wonder he opened the Heaven Gate, so arrogant!

Such a character… should be arrogant!

Yes, in any era, reaching around fourth class at Su Yu’s age warranted arrogance. Not being arrogant would be abnormal, especially as a human emperor!

“Heh!”

Su Yu let out a mocking laugh, too lazy to say more. He directly said, “According to rumors, there are countless strong beings within the Heaven Gate who can provide us with great assistance. Those who open the Heaven Gate can borrow the strongest power from within! This emperor has recently encountered formidable foes. Communicating with the Heaven Gate, can the old fellows within lend me their power?”

“Heh, you arrogant junior, borrowing power, and yet you’re so arrogant…”

Su Yu interrupted again, disdainful and mocking, “Do you think I became the Human Lord for nothing? There are mutual benefits, after all. Otherwise, would you people within the Heaven Gate be so kind, selflessly offering power to me? Why should I be polite to you! I, Su Yu, traverse the Myriad Realms, and I understand this much. I don’t need to be polite to you! Whether you lend or not, it’s not one-sided. Both parties have this intention. Since you’ve responded to my summons, you must have this intention. Do you still want to put on airs in front of me?”

Su Yu was utterly unreserved, cold and indifferent, “This emperor simply lacks time now, which is why I seek to borrow power from you people. Otherwise… you wouldn’t even qualify to converse with this emperor!”

The person beyond the Heaven Gate fell silent.

This might be the first person to borrow power with such arrogance!

Of course, he was also a smart person.

This was the judgment given to Su Yu by the person beyond the gate. This young Human Lord had indeed guessed many things, no wonder he was so arrogant, so full of himself!

The voice from beyond the gate echoed again: “Junior, you are very flamboyant. However… you must understand, at this moment, you are seeking my power. Why borrow power? Naturally, because you’ve encountered a problem you can’t solve, an opponent you can’t defeat. At this moment, even if I have my own motives, between you and me… is your strong stance really appropriate? Aren’t you worried that during the power borrowing process, you’ll encounter a formidable enemy, and I… will withdraw my power?”

Su Yu’s attitude remained cold, “Would my death benefit you? Let me put it this way, in the current Myriad Realms, only I have opened the Heaven Gate. If I die… would it benefit you? Without you, I can still find another person from within the Heaven Gate, while I… am the only one!”

The only one?

At this moment, the person beyond the gate understood Su Yu’s mindset: rarity is valuable!

Because he believed that only he could open the Heaven Gate!

However, the aged voice spoke again, with a hint of amusement: “You are mistaken. You may not know, but when you summoned, and I responded to your summons, as long as I don’t die, you cannot summon a second person. So, between you and me, we are actually bound together at this moment!”

Su Yu's expression shifted slightly, his demeanor changing a bit. "So, you're saying this is a mutually beneficial arrangement? But don't expect me to see you as some benefactor or savior. I only talk about benefits! You want to use me to achieve your goals, and I'm just negotiating with a tiger."

Su Yu spoke bluntly, and the ancient voice sighed softly. "You're quite direct! Young and arrogant, but that might not be a good thing. You don't even bother with the usual pleasantries... Can the humans you lead really thrive?"

Su Yu sneered, "Don't worry about it. Once I deal with this formidable enemy, the humans I lead will unify the Myriad Realms. Soon, I can become the second Human Emperor, perhaps even surpass him! Truly unifying the myriad races!"

"Such bold words!" The ancient voice chuckled. This new Human Lord was indeed audacious!

"In the past, your sixth-generation Human Lord also connected with the Heaven Gate, but he wasn't this arrogant..."

Su Yu's heart stirred. The sixth-generation Human Lord! A powerful figure who suddenly died. Both the Human Emperor and Su Yu speculated that it was the work of someone from the Three Gates. It seemed... it was related to the Heaven Gate, and that was also when the Three Body Method began to spread.

In that instant, Su Yu understood! The sixth-generation Human Lord was killed by an entity within the Heaven Gate. He wasn't possessed; he died resisting. The opponent was strong! Even through the Heaven Gate, they managed to kill the sixth-generation Human Lord! They might have even emerged, reversing the rules, and punishing those who didn't practice the Three Body Method!

"The sixth-generation Human Lord?" Su Yu mocked, "So what? Only in my generation have we truly suppressed the myriad races. Now, I'm just one battle away from conquering them all and unifying the heavens! Can the sixth-generation Human Lord compare to me?"

Arrogant and domineering! At this moment, the entity behind the gate couldn't help but sigh, "Enough, you're too overbearing. Let's not discuss this."

Truly, it's rare to see such audacity! In any era, facing a terrifying being whose help you need, you wouldn't dare be so impolite, let alone try to take the initiative. Indeed, emperors are different.

Gaining a verbal advantage was meaningless. The ancient entity spoke calmly, "As you said, I lend you my strength, but you must pay a price!"

Su Yu replied indifferently, "Speak, what do you want? There's nothing in the Myriad Realms that Su Yu can't obtain!"

"Heh!" The ancient entity laughed, "I don't need anything material. I only require that the Myriad Realms frequently remember my name, and that your humans offer me worship!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and he spoke in a deep voice, "An imprint of will, is it? Quite the plan! To have your name frequently remembered, to form a golden body of will for you, and then have your will imprint enter the Myriad Realms. Is that it?"

A clever one! At this moment, the elder sighed, "Dealing with someone too smart might not be a good idea!"

Su Yu sneered, "Nonsense, who among those who open the Heaven Gate is a fool? Do you take me for the Martial Emperor, that idiot?"

"The Martial Emperor?" The elder seemed to ponder for a moment, then suddenly laughed, "The Martial Emperor... is he the one suppressed by the Martial King?"

"You know about that too?" Su Yu was surprised. The elder's laughter echoed, "I know a bit. Ever since the Culture King and Martial King entered the Heaven Gate, many things are no longer secrets! Besides, there are others like me, like you, whose wills have wandered the Myriad Realms over the years..."

Su Yu's eyes gleamed. So, others have opened the Heaven Gate over the years. The sixth-generation Human Lord did it! But it was kept secret, almost unknown. Why hide it? Perhaps to lie low and wait for a moment to shine? But... he was killed by an entity within the Heaven Gate! What a pity!

The elder didn't dwell on this and soon laughed, "Young one, who is it you want to deal with? How strong are they? I see you're not weak yourself..."

"Second-tier top level!"

"Second-tier?" He seemed puzzled, and Su Yu immediately said, "You don't even know this, yet you claim to understand the Myriad Realms?"

Su Yu mocked again, "Yes, according to some ancient records, you don't categorize it this way. Let's say, about 15 paths of power!"

Upon hearing this, the other side was silent for a moment. After a while, he asked in confusion, "It's said there are no strong ones left in the Myriad Realms, all are elsewhere. How did you provoke such a powerful enemy?"

So strong! Hearing this, Su Yu lost interest. Damn it, just a second-tier! Useless! Even the interest to trap you has diminished by three points!

Su Yu sneered, "I broke the seal left by the Human Emperor. Some ancient beings emerged from the seal. Otherwise, I would have conquered the Myriad Realms long ago! My strength, my talent, is beyond your comprehension! Unfortunately... I just don't have enough time, otherwise, what is a second-tier?"

With that, Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Just say it, can you lend me strength to deal with them?"

"Second-tier top level... you yourself... don't seem too strong..."

Su Yu coldly replied, "I'm young!"

But the entity behind the gate was still frustrated. A second-tier top level is really not easy to deal with, especially when lending strength across a distance.

He thought for a moment and said, "I suggest you avoid them. Let's say, I might be strong... stronger than your opponent, but the power I can transmit, even if you borrow it, won't be much!"

"I know, aren't you comparable to the Human Emperor?"

Su Yu said coldly, "A being like the Human Emperor might have power exceeding 20 paths. Even if I borrow half, it's not comparable to 15 paths!"

Half of 20 paths... that's not just 10 paths! Half the power might exceed 15 paths!

The entity behind the gate wanted to curse. I was just boasting, and you took it seriously!

Those who can sense the Heaven Gate's shadow aren't weak. The truly weak can't sense it. The elder behind the gate isn't weak either, not the second-tier Su Yu guessed, but first-tier, though barely stepping into it!

Such a being, in any era, is among the top in the Heaven Gate. Yet... this guy provoked a second-tier peak, a 15-path powerhouse, while Su Yu himself seems to have two or three paths of power. The gap is still significant!

If he were in person, he wouldn't be afraid. The key is, he has to transmit power through the Heaven Gate!

But thinking about it, borrowing more power is actually a good thing! The more power borrowed, the stronger the transmitted power! If the borrowed power is less, it can't penetrate the Myriad Realms. So, this second-tier being is actually an opportunity.

The elder saw Su Yu's disdain and thought for a moment, "Why not try it? I'll lend you power and see how much you can utilize. If the utilization is too low... you'll have to avoid them!"

Su Yu thought for a moment, "Alright! But... don't get any funny ideas!"

Su Yu sneered, "I'll seal the Heaven Gate's shadow, not giving you a chance to penetrate. Help me kill my opponent, and I'll naturally give you a chance to penetrate. But for now... don't count on it!"

"I, Su Yu, have risen in just a few years, sweeping the Myriad Realms. Don't take me for a fool, don't get any funny ideas! By the way, what's your name?"

No one takes you for a fool! The elder thought, finding Su Yu a bit troublesome. Of course, it's not a big deal. As long as you need help, no matter how you seal it, you can't stop it!

The elder chuckled, his voice echoing, "You can call me Gui!"

"Turtle?" Su Yu was puzzled, "Old Turtle's turtle?"

"Gui!" The elder repeated, this time not in the human language, but in a willful thought. Su Yu's heart moved, "You know the human language?"

"Is it the human language?" The elder, or Gui, chuckled, "The human language... perhaps, but in our era, it wasn't the human language. It was the language of the Myriad Realms, or you could call it the language of time! As for humans... I probably don't count as one."

"The language of the Master of Time?" Su Yu thought for a moment, his mind turning, and he laughed, "So the Master of Time was really human? Or rather, humans are just a definition. In fact, apart from beasts, all in the Myriad Realms are humans, right?"

"Little one, you're very clever!"

Su Yu sneered, "Of course. By the way, the last guy who said that to me, I killed him. Don't keep repeating it, it's unnecessary!"

The last one who said that was Hundred Battle. I know I'm smart! But if you guys keep looking down on me with that arrogant attitude, I'll kill you!

Gui was blocked by his words, feeling a bit helpless. Arrogant! Unfortunately, he still needed this person to penetrate the Myriad Realms through the Heaven Gate. The Heaven Gate was about to open, and he had to grasp some things in advance, even enter the Myriad Realms to lay out plans. Thinking this way, Su Yu was indeed an opportunity, the biggest opportunity, the only opportunity!

Bear with it! The Heaven Gate is about to open, and the Earth Gate and Human Gate might be soon too. Whoever enters the Myriad Realms first, whoever starts laying out plans first, will have a greater advantage. First-tier isn't weak! It has the capital to compete for dominance!

The elder didn't bother to say more. Soon, a wisp of power penetrated, pure physical power. Su Yu quickly absorbed it, sensing it. There were no traps. Setting traps against a hegemon like Su Yu would only show the other side's stupidity.

Su Yu absorbed the power, sensing it slightly. Not bad, the amplification wasn't small, about 10%, not bad! But Su Yu's face turned a bit ugly, "Are you kidding me? Such a small amount of power, so weak, it can't even kill a Daofuse. Are you playing with me?"

"Impossible!" The elder was immediately serious, "The power I granted you isn't too strong, but those so-called quasi-kings you speak of would be easily killed by this power..."

Su Yu snorted coldly, "What a joke, were the quasi-kings of your era such weaklings? The kind that could be killed with a single punch?"

Was the power consumption too great? Or was Su Yu deceiving him?

As these thoughts crossed his mind, the old man hesitated, then channeled a large amount of power again. Su Yu continued to absorb it, and his strength increased significantly. If it was two paths of power before, it was now at least three!

Yet, Su Yu was still annoyed. "Are you playing with me? If so, you can get lost. I'll seal the Heaven Gate! What nonsense! I sought you out to deal with formidable enemies, not to scratch an itch!"

"Hmm?" The old man was puzzled. That couldn't be right!

The next moment, he said in a deep voice, "Hold on, I was just testing the power transmission loss. It was just an experiment. Why are you so impatient?"

With that, he transmitted power again, explaining as he did, "You only have the strength of two paths. Too much power, and you won't be able to handle it..."

Su Yu ignored him, absorbing the vast power and channeling it through his other paths, integrating it into his own world.

Then, Su Yu's aura erupted as he exerted himself fully, quickly cursing, "Useless!"

The old man was stunned!

Was the consumption really that high?

Damn!

The Heaven Gate was almost open, and yet the consumption was still so great?

This was his first time interacting with a Heaven Gate owner. He had only heard that the Heaven Gate consumed a lot of power in the past, but he didn't know how much.

Now, he felt it.

Too much!

It seemed like Su Yu outside hadn't improved much at all!

This... was too troublesome!

He was somewhat solemn. Su Yu's opponent was at the peak of the second tier. If Su Yu's improvement wasn't significant, he wouldn't be of much help.

At this moment, he continued to input power, pouring in a lot, at least thirty percent of his own strength!

And now, Su Yu's strength increased significantly, reaching the semblance of four paths of power.

Su Yu was pleased. "Not bad, this transmitted power, is it even one percent of yours?"

"......"

Get lost!

The old man cursed inwardly. He had already input thirty percent of his power, and Su Yu said it was only one percent?

Did Su Yu really think he was omnipotent?

What a joke!

But even with thirty percent of a first-tier's power, there should still be eight paths of power, right? Su Yu was already quite strong, but... but the improvement wasn't much!

The old man wanted to take a deep breath. The consumption was too great!

He continued to input power, this time at least half of his strength!

And Su Yu's strength increased again, laughing, "Not bad, I feel like I have six paths of power now, very good!"

The old man was shocked. Damn!

This wouldn't do!

He had input half of his power, and Su Yu only had six paths of power. Even if he gave everything, could Su Yu reach ten paths?

A first-tier with sixteen paths of power, fully supporting a two-path individual, and the latter could barely reach ten paths?

Then... he wouldn't be able to deal with a second-tier peak!

He increased the power input again. At this moment, Su Yu's body seemed to swell with pain, and his body began to crack. The old man then remembered that Su Yu hadn't reached that level yet.

He was about to stop when he heard Su Yu roar, "Good, keep going! I can handle it, it's just a small scene, very good, I feel like I'm almost at the second tier... very good!"

The old man was surprised to see Su Yu withstand it and continued to input power.

This time, he was almost going all out!

And Su Yu roared, his aura rising, and in an instant, it was as if he had become a different person, overjoyed, "Yes, this is the feeling... I feel like I have eight paths of power now, excellent!"

"......"

The old man was dumbfounded.

I... went all out!

Eight paths of power!

For a first-tier with sixteen paths, eight paths seemed like half his power, but in reality, it was nonsense. It was barely a quarter of his power!

The consumption was terrifying!

Nearly eighty percent of the power was consumed by the Heaven Gate?

He had thought Su Yu could at least reach ten paths of power!

But... no!

Only eight paths!

And Su Yu was still shouting, "Keep going, I can handle it! I'm a strong practitioner of the physical path, I can handle it! It's not enough, this strength definitely can't defeat that guy, it's not enough, Gui, give me more, use ten percent of your power, don't be stingy!"

...

At this moment.

Behind the Heaven Gate.

In the endless void.

An old man, panting heavily, was channeling a large amount of energy into a small Heaven Gate shadow, sweating profusely. He looked around cautiously, worried about being ambushed.

Fortunately, this place was quite secluded.

However, hearing Su Yu's shouts, the old man couldn't help but want to curse!

Ten percent?

I went all out!

A first-tier super strong practitioner, going all out, only managed to create a barely second-tier strong practitioner, and the other party was already at the fourth tier.

He was out of strength!

But if he said that now, this arrogant kid might think he was useless. The old man cursed inwardly, quickly saying coldly, "Don't be greedy. You've reached your limit. If I input more, you'll explode!"

...

Su Yu sneered inwardly.

Come on!

Probably went all out!

To be fair, this old man wasn't weak.

Stronger than expected.

Because Su Yu had channeled about half of the power into his own world, at this moment, he only maintained half of the power, elevating himself to the second tier... though just barely entering it.

But... this didn't count the power of Su Yu's own world. He was only considering his physical strength.

"This old man might be first-tier!"

Su Yu made a judgment. Not weak, even in the Myriad Realms, he was a top-notch existence!

However... Su Yu wasn't too satisfied.

Too little!

The power was halved by his world, nurturing it, and even absorbing half didn't improve him much.

Of course, he himself was second-tier. Going all out, borrowing Gui's power, he might have over thirteen paths of strength in the outside world.

If in his own world, he was already at the peak of the second tier, borrowing a bit more power, he might have a chance at first-tier!

Thoughts flashed through Su Yu's mind, and he quickly said, "This power isn't enough, Gui, too weak, I can't fight the opponent with this..."

"You can't handle it!"

Hearing Gui's voice, Su Yu snorted, "Are you looking down on me? Fine, you're right... I don't necessarily have to kill the opponent, but I must have the strength to contend with them! At a critical moment, lend me more power. This is just a test! Can you still lend power?"

"...I can!"

Gui lied!

Couldn't help but want to curse!

Lend your ancestor!

Su Yu nodded in satisfaction, "Alright then..."

Just as he finished speaking, Su Yu frowned, "What are you doing? Why are you withdrawing your power?"

Gui was stunned, puzzled, "Are you going to fight now?"

"Of course not, but I need to adapt to the power. Are you a strong practitioner or not?"

Su Yu said angrily, "Do I not need to adapt to the power, just use it directly? Are you trying to kill me? I need to maintain this power, let my body adapt, let my path adapt, let my whole being adapt! It's just a bit of power, just leave it here and don't worry about it, why withdraw it? What if I encounter a crisis?"

"......"

Gui almost wanted to kill him!

You... want me to maintain it continuously?

I... I'll die of exhaustion!

He was a bit impatient, a bit regretful, but on second thought... maybe it was a good thing. It was good, then my power could always adapt to the Myriad Realms!

Yes!

But in the Heaven Gate, he had to be careful, otherwise, maintaining it like this, his true self would have no power left, and if trouble came, he would die miserably!

Last time, during a gathering with old friends, one of them who had lent power to the sixth generation Human Lord always said the sixth generation was too cautious, rarely borrowing power, and even then, borrowing very little, not daring to borrow much.

As a result, he couldn't descend into the Myriad Realms in person!

Now... my opportunity has come!

Thinking this, Gui felt much better. This Su Yu, really bold, dared to borrow all his power, and not just that, let him maintain it continuously, this courage was sky-high!

Since Su Yu said so, he didn't mind whether he was tired or not, quickly smiling, "Fine, since you say so, this power will remain in your body!"

"That's more like it!"

Su Yu was satisfied, waving his hand, the Heaven Gate was firmly locked by his sea of will, giving no chance for peeking, sneering, "Don't try anything! Whether I encounter enemies or not, I won't tell you, lest you seize the opportunity to ambush me! Better safe than sorry!"

At this moment, the Heaven Gate was completely locked by him, the other party couldn't see outside, couldn't hear outside, the Heaven Gate was Su Yu's, naturally, he could lock it in his sea of will!

Gui was a bit speechless, soon indifferent, casually saying, "Suit yourself!"

All I want is to adapt to the Myriad Realms now.

You lock it, my power is still in the Myriad Realms!

Once I imprint my mark, you won't be able to stop me!

And this time might be soon, because I'm going all out!

Now, Gui was smiling.

His old friend had schemed for many years, imprinting little by little, and ultimately couldn't descend in person, while he didn't need to scheme at all, this tenth generation Human Lord was really domineering, really arrogant, just letting him maintain all his power in his body!

Gui looked around, quickly setting up some formations, concealing himself, not worrying about the Myriad Realms, but being careful not to be discovered!

...

At this moment, Su Yu's smile was radiant!

Awesome!

An old guy, using his power to continuously fill his world, maintaining the strength of his world, truly awesome!

I'll drain you dry!

Hopefully, you're strong enough to last a while, allowing the physical path in my world to complete an evolution!

Currently, in Su Yu's world, the strongest path power was only third-tier.

He reached second-tier, that was the collective power.

If this old fellow can elevate his physical Dao to the second tier... then my world will have a second-tier powerhouse!

At this moment, Su Yu was in an exceptionally good mood!

If I had known I could borrow power, I would have done so long ago. It's a pity I only realized it now!

I must make good use of this opportunity!

If I don't strip this Gui of everything, I won't be called Su Yu.

Su Yu was fully aware of the other party's intentions... If your true self has the guts, just come out. I'll kill you and stuff you into my world to nurture it!

His radiant smile persisted until Zhan Wang arrived. Seeing Su Yu's bright smile, Zhan Wang suddenly felt a bit uneasy.

Is this person... mocking me?

That smile is somewhat chilling!
