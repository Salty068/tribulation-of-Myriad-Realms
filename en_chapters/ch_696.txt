Chapter 696: The Four Paths Converge

East Rift Valley.

Currently, the East Rift Valley had no stationed troops, as the army was engaged in battles across the land. Where the vanguard camp once stood, a small palace had been erected, serving as Su Yu's temporary residence.

At this moment, Duobao was anxiously waiting. It had been several months! He had been waiting here for several months, and it was the first time he had seen someone at the Daofuse Realm come to pledge allegiance, only to be ignored by the Human Lord for months. Such treatment could probably be traced back to ancient times. In those days, even if the Human Emperor didn't personally appear, there would be a master of laws to receive them. Su Yu, this guy, was truly arrogant. Moreover, I even brought a supreme treasure to pledge my allegiance!

Duobao was growing impatient, and just then, a figure appeared—not Su Yu, but a formidable expert wielding a large club. Upon seeing the figure, Duobao's expression changed.

Heavendoom!

This guy again!

Heavendoom laughed heartily, "Duobao, want to have some fun? It's been three days since our last bout. How about a match?"

Duobao cursed inwardly. Ever since he arrived, these people had no intention of letting him leave. Either he joined them, or... he waited to be killed. There was no third option; he couldn't escape. So, he saw Heavendoom, this guy who was unknown to the outside world but was actually at the Daofuse Realm.

Over the past three months, he had fought Heavendoom 180 times. Initially, it was three times a day, but it had eased up a bit recently. For the past three days, Heavendoom hadn't come, and Duobao thought this guy had finally given up.

Heavendoom laughed, "I was out handling some matters the past couple of days, almost missed our sparring. Duobao, come on, let's not waste time!"

Heavendoom found it frustrating to fight anyone. He couldn't defeat the strong, and the weak didn't interest him. Finally finding a worthy opponent, he was itching for a fight after three days without one. He had just returned from escorting Zhao Chuan and the others and couldn't wait to find Duobao.

Duobao forced a smile, "Brother Heavendoom, we've sparred many times. How about we take a break? When will Emperor Yu return? Can you give me a definite answer?"

"That, I don't know!"

Heavendoom replied nonchalantly, "Why are you in such a hurry? Fight me to your heart's content, and I'll help you find out!"

Duobao was helpless, cursing inwardly. Fight my foot! He had no desire to spar with Heavendoom. It was too annoying; he couldn't win, and going all out wasn't an option. No matter what he did, it was wrong. After so many bouts, wasn't this guy tired of it yet?

While Duobao cursed inwardly, he maintained a smile and said, "Brother Heavendoom, could you perhaps ask the Great Zhou King for me?"

"That won't do..."

Just then, the voice of the Great Zhou King came through, "Daoist Duobao, come to the main hall. Emperor Yu might be returning!"

"Alright!"

Duobao was overjoyed and quickly headed towards the distant main hall, ignoring Heavendoom. Heavendoom watched him run off, feeling a bit speechless. Such timing? Was the Great Zhou King lying?

He thought for a moment and quickly followed with his club.

Soon, the two arrived at the main hall. At that moment, the Great Zhou King's figure flickered and disappeared, quickly arriving at the hall. Moments later, Wan Tiansheng entered with a smile, glanced at the Great Zhou King, and nodded with a smile. The Great Zhou King also furrowed his brows slightly before relaxing and nodding with a smile.

Both of them sensed some movement. The Great Zhou King was somewhat surprised; he was the first to sense it, while there were many strong individuals in the palace, yet it seemed only Wan Tiansheng noticed and arrived quickly.

As they pondered, the void fluctuated. The River of Time appeared, and Su Yu stepped on the river, hands behind his back, descending gracefully. With a single step, he ascended the platform, and in Duobao's somewhat dazzled state, Su Yu instantly took his seat.

The Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng were both slightly taken aback. At this moment, Su Yu's aura hadn't changed much, but it was clear that he had grown even stronger. In just a few months, this person hadn't been idle. Three months used as three thousand years?

"Congratulations, Emperor Yu!" The Great Zhou King congratulated him. Su Yu's smile was as warm as a spring breeze, and he chuckled, "Nothing to celebrate, just normal cultivation."

With that, he looked down at Duobao. Duobao felt a bit uneasy under his gaze but quickly said, "Duobao pays respects to Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu looked at this fellow, who appeared quite plump and honest, but those small eyes betrayed his cunning nature. This guy's true form was a rat that had transformed into a Dao. In ancient times, he was a general under a human marquis.

Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened silently, and he looked at Duobao. He saw a massive jar vaguely appearing above this guy's head. Su Yu raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Over these days, he had observed countless Daos, and with a glance, he could make some judgments. This jar seemed to be a type of devouring Dao, related to Duobao's previous devouring of the Origin Returning Blade's treasure aura to achieve Daofuse.

Su Yu roughly judged it to be a specific devouring Dao, capable of devouring certain treasure auras. As for the power of this Dao, Su Yu pondered. If he encountered someone skilled in weaponry with powerful weapons, Duobao would have a significant advantage over them! Simply put, the ancient Weapon Fusion Method could easily be countered by him. Because if this guy truly used his Dao, he might devour the opponent's fused weapons, rendering them powerless. Their strength would inevitably decline!

Su Yu quickly closed the Heaven Gate and looked at Heavendoom, who was grinning smugly. Suddenly, he chuckled, "Duobao, you're quite the character!"

Duobao was taken aback. What did he mean by that?

Su Yu said calmly, "Others come to pledge allegiance by showcasing their strength to earn respect, but you... you must have sparred with Heavendoom quite a bit and lost, right?"

Duobao suspected that Su Yu had been watching all along and might have seen his sparring with Heavendoom. Just as he was about to respond, Heavendoom boasted, "Of course, how could he be my match? I could have beaten him long ago!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Without your club, could you handle him?"

Heavendoom was momentarily stunned, then quickly said, "More or less!"

"What if your club suddenly exploded?"

Heavendoom opened his mouth, hesitated for a while, and then said, "How could that be? My club is very sturdy. If it really exploded... that would mean I'm severely injured, and of course, I wouldn't be able to beat him."

Su Yu looked at Duobao and smiled faintly, "If I were you, when pledging allegiance, I'd show my value. For example, I'd first blow up Heavendoom's club, give him a good beating, and teach him a lesson! Why keep pretending to be a fool? In this era, strength is still paramount."

Duobao's eyes flickered, and he quickly said, "Emperor Yu, you're joking. How could I be a match for Heavendoom..."

Su Yu yawned and chuckled, "Really? If Heavendoom didn't follow the Weapon Fusion Method, he might be hard to deal with, but since he does, aren't you the perfect counter? With your treasure Dao, absorb more of his club's treasure aura, break his club, and how could Heavendoom be your match?"

Beside him, Heavendoom looked at Duobao suspiciously. Duobao, however, had beads of sweat forming on his forehead and said awkwardly, "Emperor Yu, what you're saying... I... I don't have the ability to break Brother Heavendoom's Weapon Fusion..."

Su Yu said calmly, "Alright, no need to pursue this further! I've observed thousands of Daos; what can be hidden from me?"

Duobao dared not speak further, feeling genuinely apprehensive now. This person... really saw through it! His strength wasn't particularly strong, having only recently reached Daofuse, but his Dao was indeed unique, significantly countering those who used the Weapon Fusion Method to prove their Dao. Devouring treasure aura! It seemed useless, but in reality, it was incredibly useful. What cultivator didn't have some treasures? Be it weapons or auxiliary divine talismans, they all contained treasure aura. Once encountered by Duobao, they would be countered.

At this moment, with Su Yu's words revealing everything, how could Duobao not be alarmed? Meanwhile, Heavendoom scrutinized Duobao suspiciously, remaining silent, but his eyes darted around, clearly deep in thought.

Su Yu leaned back in his chair, appearing relaxed, and said, "Speak, the Great Zhou King has sent me several messages, saying you have something to discuss with me. Be quick, speak directly. I once said I'd kill you, so let's see how you plan to buy your life."

Duobao forced a smile, "Emperor Yu, I sincerely came to pledge allegiance..."

Su Yu said calmly, "Be quick! Being an enemy of mine, do you think just pledging allegiance can solve the problem? If that were the case, Tiangu and the others would all be willing to come here. Saying nice things doesn't cost anything!"

It's hard to offer help in times of need, but easy to add to the icing on the cake. Now, the Human Race is strong, though there's still the threat from the Upper Realm, currently, the Human Race stands dominant. Duobao's allegiance isn't exactly offering help in times of need.

Duobao was speechless and had no choice but to quickly say, "I brought a supreme treasure for Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu looked at him with interest. Duobao gritted his teeth and quickly took out a golden page. The golden page was still struggling. At this moment, several fragments on Su Yu's body began to resonate, wanting to merge.

Su Yu smiled. The Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng both showed slight changes in expression. The Great Zhou King had urged Su Yu to return because Duobao claimed to have important matters to report to Su Yu personally, but he hadn't mentioned bringing the Hunting Heavens List!

Heavendoom also recognized it at a glance, surprised, "Did you kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis?"

This was the Hunting Heavens List! The treasure that the Heavenly Overseer Marquis revered like a grandfather! How did it end up in Duobao's hands?

The next moment, Heavendoom questioned, "Did you forge it?"

Duobao grinned, how could that be? Am I an idiot?

Su Yu didn't say anything, reaching out to grab the golden page. Simultaneously, in his mind, the Book of Time trembled slightly. This Hunting Heavens List was actually a replica of the Book of Time.

Su Yu examined it for a while, chuckling, "The four paths of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone have finally converged!"

He sighed, "Did the Heavenly Overseer Marquis send you?"

Duobao couldn't have obtained this on his own; only if the Heavenly Overseer Marquis gave it to him willingly could he have it.

Duobao nodded, "Yes, he said this thing has become a hindrance to him, and he's letting it go!"

"Indeed."

Su Yu smiled, "To think he could see through it. Having followed the Culture King for some years, he's not entirely foolish. Obsessing over the Hunting Heavens List without being able to control it, why bother!"

Then he added, "Is there anything else? Even if he can't control it, he wouldn't let you deliver it to me for nothing."

Duobao quickly said, "I went to persuade him to join the Human Race with me. I thought that since neither of us had killed any Human Race experts and had only opposed them a few times, there might still be a chance. After all, he was under the Culture King..."

Duobao continued rapidly, "He said that you and he are destined to have a battle, and only you can kill him. No one else can."

He recounted the words of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis from that day.

Su Yu fell into deep thought, as did the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng. Even Heavendoom was pondering, but none of them could come up with any clues.

After a long while, Su Yu suddenly chuckled, and the Great Zhou King's expression changed. Wan Tiansheng also had a peculiar look in his eyes, as if they had all realized something.

"After over a hundred thousand years, he finally knows who he is... the Culture King's scheme..."

Su Yu laughed, but then sighed, "I think I've figured it out. It's a pity. If the ancient times hadn't ended, he should have long become a master of the power of laws."

He shook his head, "After the Ninth Tide ended, did this guy enter a period of decline?"

Duobao looked at Su Yu suspiciously and hesitated before saying, "It seems so."

"The Hundred Battle King really put him in a tough spot!"

Su Yu sighed.

Duobao was confused. What did this have to do with the Hundred Battle King?

The Great Zhou King's eyes flickered with uncertainty, and he said in a low voice, "He... Emperor Yu, how could he be in the hands of the Culture King?"

Su Yu calmly replied, "In ancient times, the Culture King was more famous than the Human Emperor. It's normal for him to be in charge."

Heavendoom was bewildered, not understanding.

Duobao was equally puzzled.

However, Wan Tiansheng spoke in a deep voice, "If that's the case, we need to gather strong experts from all sides to eliminate him!"

"No need."

Su Yu smiled, "He is the embodiment of fortune. More people won't necessarily kill him. In fact, it might lead to unexpected outcomes! If he were that easy to kill, he would have been dead long ago! The Heavenly Overseer Marquis is interesting. He's seen through some things. I think he truly has the potential to advance quickly, perhaps even stepping into the realm of a Heavenly King or beyond."

He continued with a smile, "It seems we really need to kill him before the Hundred Battle King makes his move..."

The Great Zhou King spoke solemnly, "Emperor Yu, I think..."

"I don't need your opinion."

Su Yu said calmly, "The Heavenly Overseer Marquis himself has seen through it. He is the orthodox fortune! The ancient dynasty's fortune has extended to this day! And the orthodox of the ancient dynasty is not me, but the Hundred Battle King! Without the fall of the previous dynasty, how can there be a new one? The Hundred Battle King is hard to kill, so we should kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and seize the accumulated fortune of the Human Race over countless years!"

The Great Zhou King looked heavy.

Su Yu continued calmly, "I know, you are the Human Emperor's scribe, but the Human Emperor has been gone for a hundred thousand years! After a hundred thousand years, it's time for a change of dynasty! If the Heavenly Overseer Marquis doesn't die and sides with the Hundred Battle King, it will be another setback for me!"

Wan Tiansheng also chuckled softly, "Emperor Yu is right. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis has gathered countless fortunes over a hundred thousand years! Fortune is an elusive thing, but it truly exists, or it can be considered a special kind of great path. His path is clearly not aligned with my New Yu Dynasty, but leans towards the ancient dynasty, towards the Hundred Battle King and his ilk!"

Wan Tiansheng spoke softly, "If this person doesn't perish, the new dynasty will find it difficult to produce a Daofuse cultivator!"

He continued with a smile, "How can the Hundred Battle King alone occupy the path of the physical body? Even if he becomes an ancient Human King, there were many Human Kings of the physical body in ancient times! Now it seems that because the Hundred Battle King hasn't emerged, the ancient era hasn't continued, and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis has sealed the fortune, leading to the Human Race's misfortune!"

He added, "Emperor Yu's fortune is like a rainbow. It seems that the inheritance of the Culture King and the Time Sage has accumulated enough fortune to surpass the other side. Otherwise... without the Tenth Tide, the Tenth Tide is merely an extension of the ancient, merely an extension of the Ninth Tide!"

Heavendoom was confused, not understanding.

What are you all talking about?

I can't understand a word!

Duobao, however, seemed to have a vague understanding, and his eyes changed slightly.

The Great Zhou King struggled, and Su Yu looked at him. The Great Zhou King said bitterly, "The ancient..."

Su Yu said calmly, "You said it yourself, that was the ancient times!"

"I know."

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Perhaps... it was wrong from the start. With the Human Emperor gone, how can we establish a new dynasty and create new glory without breaking free from their influence? Yet, everyone wanted to continue that glory, rather than starting anew."

He felt a sense of desolation.

The era of the Human Emperor was truly coming to an end!

And the key to this was the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

"Um... what are you all talking about?"

Heavendoom couldn't help but interject, unable to hold back any longer. What are you all saying?

Su Yu smiled and explained, "Simply put, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis represents the fortune of the ancient dynasty! He is the symbol of the ancient dynasty, the continuation of its fortune! The Culture King used the fortune of the ancient dynasty to transform him into a spirit! He mentioned the Hundred Battle King, which means he has seen through it, understood it! The Hundred Battle King is the true orthodox of the ancient dynasty. If he doesn't die, I am the traitor!"

Su Yu smiled playfully, "So, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis knows this, and he also knows that I have shared the fortune of the ancient dynasty. The Culture King and the Time Sage chose me, while other ancient relics chose the Hundred Battle King! He actually represents the Hundred Battle King. If he kills me, he has the hope of integrating all the fortune and stepping into the realm of the true master of the power of laws with the Hundred Battle King!"

"And if I kill him, it means the old has ended, and the new has begun!"

Su Yu smiled brightly, "At that time, I will inherit the ancient fortune, unseal the fortune, and the Human Race's fortune will soar. Then, this tide of the Human Race will have the hope of advancing to Daofuse! Previously, it didn't happen because this tide... wasn't recognized by the ancient dynasty's fortune!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Do you understand what I mean? In the previous nine times, the inheritance continued, and each time, many ancient relics were left behind, choosing the Human Lord, uniting the world, so each time someone could step into Daofuse! This tide didn't work, not because the Hundred Battle King truly occupied the entire path of the physical body, but because the fortune wasn't strong enough. This tide of the Human Race didn't receive the ancient dynasty's fortune. The Human Race's fortune was split in two, so after I rose, only then did someone step into the Daofuse realm."

Heavendoom listened in a daze, and after a long time, he said, "You mean, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis... he... he represents the ancient fortune?"

Su Yu nodded, "Exactly! And not just that..."

Su Yu picked up the Hunting Heaven List and smiled, "There's also this. It helps the Heavenly Overseer Marquis stabilize the Human Race's fortune! Interesting! The path of fortune is indeed special!"

At this moment, Duobao was deeply shaken.

Fortune, the representative of ancient fortune, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis!

He... continues the ancient orthodox.

And Su Yu, it seems, is not. The Hundred Battle King is.

Heavendoom shook his head, dazed, "Then... why doesn't the Heavenly Overseer Marquis wait for the Hundred Battle King to appear and then join forces with him to deal with you?"

"Why did he give you the Hunting Heaven List?"

Su Yu laughed, "The Hundred Battle King is actually also consuming his fortune. After the Ninth Tide, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis must have experienced some lows, and if he waits for the Hundred Battle King to emerge, perhaps the Hundred Battle King will also discover something and might go to him first and devour him!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Forget it, you don't understand! This thing is quite mysterious! The path of fortune, in my view, is still a very powerful path. It affects your perception, causes you to misjudge, and makes you constantly encounter trouble..."

Su Yu continued, laughing, "By handing over the Hunting Heaven List to me, firstly, it returns to its rightful owner, freeing him from the Culture King's influence! Secondly, if he continues to hold this item, it might not bring him any benefits and could even backfire, leading to him being counter-killed by me and others! Thirdly, giving this item to me might not be a good thing either. I've already embarked on the pen dao, and dividing my attention to study the paper dao might not be beneficial for me."

Heavendoom nodded, still bewildered and shaken.

Such a powerful feeling.

Did the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng really understand?

Probably not!

Just a few words, and he couldn't make sense of it, yet these few seemed to understand everything. Damn, is it because they're from the Human Race, or because they're all cultural researchers?

Scholars, the Human Race, truly are cunning and deceitful.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King sighed, "The Heavenly Overseer Marquis... I hadn't thought of it before, but it turns out he is the continuation of ancient fortune, fortune incarnate... The Culture King's methods are unimaginably high! Fortune incarnate, with intelligence, becomes stronger and more cunning. If the myriad races want to destroy the Human Race, they must first destroy the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, but he happens to be the spirit of fortune, knowing how to avoid danger! As a result, if he doesn't perish, the Human Race won't perish. If the Human Race doesn't perish, he continues to thrive in fortune... With the Culture King's protection, if the Human Race maintains a single line of inheritance, he won't die."

He continued with a bitter smile, "I'm afraid that throughout history, no Human Lord has ever thought of killing him. In fact, some Human Lords might know something."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Indeed! As long as the dynasty doesn't perish, he won't perish! Killing him is too difficult! However, he was also tricked by the Hundred Battle King. After the Ninth Tide, his fortune declined, and everything he did was met with trouble... leading to today's enlightenment."

Below, Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "So the ancient relics in the Upper Realm waiting for the Hundred Battle King's return are correct! Once he returns, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's fortune might rise again, and the ancient inheritance in the Upper Realm might see a surge in fortune, producing another batch of Daofuse cultivators!"

Su Yu nodded, "That's the logic! But because of this tide, we broke this inheritance and continuation, unable to enjoy these benefits, so everyone is stuck at the Eternal Realm, unable to enter Daofuse!"

Su Yu smiled, "The Great Zhou King isn't entirely wrong. If we really wait a few more decades, when the Hundred Battle King emerges, the Human Race's fortune will rise again, and we might see some Daofuse cultivators emerge, as long as this tide continues to follow the Hundred Battle King."

He added with a smile, "But it's not just that!"

万天圣 nodded, his voice chilling, "It's not just that! The Heavenly Overseer Marquis represents more than just the Human Race; he embodies the fate of the ancient dynasty, which includes not only humans but the myriad races as well! That's why both sides have been entangled for a hundred thousand years, unable to determine a victor! Eliminating the Heavenly Overseer Marquis would not only diminish the fortune of the Hundred Battle King but also that of the myriad races! Emperor Yu, I propose we gather our strongest to besiege him! No matter how strong his fortune, it can be countered!"

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng's tone was icy. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis had to be killed. His death would signify the end of the ancient dynasty era, and the fortune would return to Su Yu, making everything he did even smoother than it already was.

Su Yu, however, chuckled, "Why the rush? Fortune is just that—mysterious but not necessarily all-powerful. If it were truly that formidable, the Human Emperor would have absorbed it long ago! The saying goes, 'As long as fortune remains, the dynasty endures, and the self remains unbroken.' It's just a saying! The Hundred Battle King and the Human Emperor are both dead; the Heavenly Overseer Marquis will fall on his own!"

"If he wants to compete with me, let him. When I have time, I'll seek him out!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Culture King seems to meddle in everything, even matters of fortune! Why do I feel like the Human Emperor is becoming a puppet? Shouldn't the fortune of the dynasty be the Human Emperor's concern?"

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "Perhaps it's a diversion. The Culture King is full of surprises. If the Heavenly Overseer Marquis were under the Human Emperor, he might have been eliminated long ago! But under the Culture King, it's seen as normal. The Culture King has always been inclusive, with all sorts of oddities under his command."

Su Yu nodded slightly, acknowledging the point.

Only now did Heavendoom seem to understand, somewhat shocked, "So, if we kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, we become the legitimate rulers? Are we not considered legitimate now?"

Su Yu smiled, "It's not about legitimacy; it's about breaking free from ancient constraints!"

He sighed, "The ancients produced too many prodigies. The pool is only so big, and they've divided the territory. Without breaking and reforging the ancient, how can we create a new pool to accommodate us?"

Su Yu shook his head, "For the past hundred thousand years, no master of rules has emerged, perhaps due to this. Everything is tied to the ancient, unchanged for a hundred thousand years. How can we rebuild the world?"

Heavendoom blinked, "So, if we kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, this era could produce a master of rules?"

Su Yu nodded, "There's hope, not just for the Human Race but for the myriad races as well! Killing the Heavenly Overseer Marquis signifies a new beginning, the end of ancient glory!"

"Is he really that important?"

Heavendoom was incredibly surprised, "I thought he wasn't important."

"Then why did he reveal his identity?"

Heavendoom was still puzzled, even after Su Yu explained.

Su Yu laughed, Heavendoom was as talkative as ever. He explained again, "Even if he didn't say it, I would eventually sense it! As I grow stronger, I'm actually sharing his fortune, which will only weaken over time! Instead of that, he might as well seize an opportunity to compete with me, hoping for a chance, rather than being slowly weakened by me!"

"Oh!"

Su Yu didn't dwell on it further; it was only a matter of time. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis had merely seen it clearly.

At this moment, he showed some courage.

Wan Tiansheng, however, smiled slyly, "There might be other reasons, like... fearing the Hundred Battle King will emerge and not help him, but instead, harm him. After all, it's not the first time he's been harmed! Rather than betting on the Hundred Battle King bringing him benefits, it's better to take a gamble himself. Unreliable teammates are scarier!"

"Hahaha!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, nodding, "Makes sense!"

The Great Zhou King was embarrassed. Was that really a reason?

Perhaps it was!

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis might truly not trust the Hundred Battle King and found himself more reliable, hence choosing to confront Su Yu early to avoid being dragged down.

"Duobao!"

Su Yu laughed for a moment, then called out in a deep voice. Duobao quickly responded, "Here!"

"Since you've brought the Hunting Heaven List, I understand the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's intention! I'll give him face and write off our past grievances. I won't hold it against you!"

Duobao secretly smiled bitterly, feeling... truly undervalued!

Bringing the Hunting Heaven List only resulted in past grievances being written off.

He was, after all, a Daofuse cultivator!

Su Yu said coldly, "Don't think being a Daofuse cultivator is impressive! Having a disobedient Daofuse cultivator is more dangerous than having a strong enemy! A single rat can spoil a pot of soup! You're too slick, opportunistic. In favorable battles, you can fight, but in adverse ones, you might be the first to flee, disrupting my army's morale! Although I'm young, I have a keen eye for people!"

"Going forward, I might lose, I might fail! Others trust me and won't cause trouble in the short term, but people like you are too easily the instigators of my army's collapse!"

Su Yu said coldly, "That's why I never intended to take you in from the start! People like you are better off dead! Typical opportunists!"

Duobao was extremely embarrassed.

Su Yu said calmly, "But since you've brought the Hunting Heaven List, killing you now would make me seem intolerant! Using future events that haven't happened to target you. Forget it, I have no other demands for you. In favorable battles, you're useful! If I ever fail... Director Wan, Great Zhou King, if he's the first to flee, ignore everything else! Kill him! He must be killed!"

"Understood!"

The Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng both responded!

Duobao was embarrassed, smiling bitterly, helpless, but he knew... Su Yu truly had a keen eye.

This... was indeed very likely.

If Su Yu encountered trouble and showed signs of decline, he might indeed be the first to flee.

But today, Su Yu's words made it clear to the two top powerhouses that if such a situation arose, they should kill him regardless, making Duobao feel extremely awkward.

Now, even if Su Yu truly failed, as long as the Great Zhou King and others survived, he must not be the first to flee.

Otherwise, he might really face disaster!

In the hall, Heavendoom grinned, "If he dares to run, I'll be the first to smash him!"

Su Yu laughed, "Forget it, he's particularly good at targeting the Weapon Fusion Dao! Unless you integrate your weapon into the Great Dao! That's also a path for the later stages of the Weapon Fusion Dao, transforming the Dao into a weapon! The Culture King once transformed the Dao into a pen; the Great Dao is the weapon, and the weapon is the Great Dao. That's the path the Weapon Fusion Dao should take in its later stages."

Su Yu advised, "No matter how sturdy your big stick is, it's just a weapon, not the rules of the Great Dao! You should now think about how to transform the power of the Great Dao into your weapon, fully integrating the weapon into the Great Dao!"

"Oh!"

Heavendoom nodded, understanding this part. It was about transforming the Great Dao into his big stick. He got it and would think more about it later.

"Duobao, since you've joined me, I'll give you a task!"

"Emperor Yu, please instruct!"

Duobao quickly responded.

Su Yu said, "You're a Treasure Mouse who has attained the Dao, most sensitive to treasures!"

With that, Su Yu took out a councilor's token, "Some councilor tokens from the myriad races have been lost or scattered somewhere. Treasures gathering dust, picked up by someone who might not even care! Of the 99 councilor tokens, not many are confirmed to be in place. The rest must still be scattered across the myriad realms."

"Except for the three races of gods, demons, and immortals, you can check the other races in the myriad realms and see if you can find them!"

Su Yu looked at him, "I don't expect you to participate in the great battles. Your task is simple: help me find the councilor tokens!"

Duobao quickly agreed, "Alright! I'll do my best in this matter!"

Great! This way, he could help the Human Race without participating in the great battles, which was safe and aligned with his intentions. Su Yu assigning this task clearly took these factors into account.

Su Yu said, "Have Tian Yue accompany you to prevent you from pocketing any finds!"

"Tian Yue?"

Duobao was taken aback. Su Yu smiled, "Since you're familiar with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, you must know Tian Yue! Tian Yue has also entered the Daofuse Realm. With him, you won't be suppressed in small realms and can cooperate well! You should know each other, so I don't need to introduce you. Heavendoom, take him to find Tian Yue and convey my words to Tian Yue. I need the councilor tokens!"

"Alright!"

Heavendoom nodded, smiling at Duobao, "Brother Duobao, let's go. Come on, let's spar a bit. I want to see how you absorb my big stick!"

Duobao was speechless.

Who the heck absorbs your big stick!

In the hall, Su Yu and the others exchanged glances, all speechless.

Such wild words!

Forget it, Heavendoom is just like that, always talking about his big stick, impossible to correct.

...

Once they left, Wan Tiansheng smiled, "Now that you have the four paths of pen, ink, paper, and inkstone, do you plan to cultivate the paper path yourself? The paper path might not be simple."

Su Yu nodded, "Not only is it not simple, but the paper path might also be more suitable for the Human Race, possibly even better than the path of the Desolate Beast! I'll study it and see. The paper path... the Hunting Heaven List can cover the myriad heavens, collecting the aura of the myriad heavens, sensing intelligence from the myriad heavens... I've thought of someone."

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "Do you really want to give it to him?"

"Why not?"

Su Yu smiled, "As long as the Principal can control him!"

Wan Tiansheng smiled wryly, "He might not necessarily walk the paper path!"

"It doesn't matter if he doesn't; the Hunting Heaven List is already a top-tier divine weapon!"

Su Yu laughed, "If Lantian gets his hands on it, who in the myriad realms can hide from him?"

Yes, Lantian!

The Hunting Heaven List, monitoring the myriad heavens, was actually the first thing they thought of for Lantian.

It would definitely suit Lantian extremely well!

Moreover, the Hunting Heaven List had many uses. Previously, it was incomplete, but now all the fragments were with Su Yu. Once repaired, if Lantian took control, he might be even more powerful than the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

From then on, the myriad heavens would be Su Yu's eyes and ears!

Beside him, the Great Zhou King remained silent.

Su Yu intended to give this to Lantian, and he had guessed it. Su Yu himself might not pursue other Great Daos anymore; one pen dao was enough for Su Yu to walk down.

Su Yu's audacity was truly unparalleled. The saying "biting off more than one can chew" didn't seem to apply to him. Most people, upon discovering four Great Daos within themselves, would have hoarded them all, never considering sharing with others. Previously, the Great Qin King and others were stronger than Su Yu. Had Su Yu chosen to inherit everything alone, he might have already reached the power of a Heavenly King by now!

The Great Zhou King sighed once more, his thoughts drifting to the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. If Su Yu truly intended to kill the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, he would become the second Human Emperor, a new dynasty's Human Emperor, rather than a successor of the ancient era!

Moreover, this time upon Su Yu's return, he seemed even more formidable. It might not be long before Su Yu surpassed some of the top-tier experts.

A truly terrifying individual!
