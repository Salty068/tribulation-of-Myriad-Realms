Chapter 837: He Arrives! (Please Subscribe)

In the River of Time.

Su Yu led his group upstream, quickly reaching a point he recognized—the entrance to the ninth level of the Luminous Domain Mansion! Below this point lay the remains of a fallen ruler of laws, King Yue!

This time, Marquis Huoyun did not accompany them.

Su Yu gazed down at this node for a while before calmly stating, "This is their final return point. When they reach here, the Myriad Realms will converge with them!"

"Going upstream, time slows down. While we are there, much time may pass here!"

"Therefore, those who stayed behind might progress even faster than us. So even if everyone reaches the level of a ruler of laws, do not become complacent!"

Behind him, over thirty powerful figures nodded in agreement. However, the Martial Emperor seemed indifferent, muttering under his breath. Su Yu's expression suddenly turned cold as he looked back at the Martial Emperor, saying icily, "I usually don't bother with you! Do you think that just because you've stepped into the second tier, you can act without restraint? Martial Emperor, let me reiterate: orders must be followed! I govern you with military law, and should anything go awry, I will execute you!"

The Martial Emperor's heart tightened.

He had reached the second tier, and Su Yu, without the cover of his own world, was actually on par with him. Yet, under Su Yu's cold and stern gaze, the Martial Emperor felt a chill.

Su Yu... would really kill!

This guy had been on the battlefield before and had executed those who caused trouble.

Su Yu's face remained indifferent as he turned his gaze forward. The River of Time, flowing upstream, could attract the attention of the Myriad Races, potentially sparking a great war.

Even with the current human forces, they had only about eighty rulers of laws, while the opposing side had over a hundred.

The Human Emperor's forces were stretched thin, and a sudden outbreak of war would not be favorable!

If the Human Emperor were to fall, the human race would surely collapse.

At this moment, Su Yu still couldn't control the rulers of laws on the Human Emperor's side. Those veteran rulers of laws had followed the Human Emperor into countless battles and were not easily controlled by anyone else.

Even the Great Zhou King, who had been with Su Yu day and night, would choose the Human Emperor over him, let alone those others.

So if the Human Emperor died, Su Yu would not be able to control those people, and among them, there were certainly those stronger than Su Yu!

Not to mention, the second-tier Radiant King from back then—has he not reached the first tier by now?

What about the Battle King and others? Have they not reached the first tier?

These are uncertain matters.

And on the opposing side, there must be first-tier experts. The emperors of the great clans like the Immortals, Demons, Gods, Dragons, and Nether Races—after so many years, none of them have reached the first tier?

If none have, then they are truly useless!

The Myriad Races are not incompetent.

It's just that the Myriad Races are scattered, each harboring their own agendas. Until the moment of life and death, it's hard for them to unite, like Tiangu and the others, who only managed to unify their forces at the last moment.

Otherwise, how could the human race, a single race, contend with the Myriad Races?

Su Yu continued upstream, his pace unhurried.

He was trying to draw upon the power of his own world, hoping to extend its influence.

However... Su Yu also realized that the farther he was from the Myriad Realms, the harder it was to extend the power of his world.

At this moment, he could still draw some power over, but Su Yu judged that perhaps by the time he reached the Human Emperor's side, his world's power would be completely unable to extend.

There would be a threshold!

Beyond this threshold, he was just an ordinary second-tier. Although everyone's strength had been enhanced by him, they were still just a group of ordinary fourth-tier rulers of laws.

Yes, only fourth-tier!

Even if they had drawn upon their past selves, even if some fourth-tier could exert third-tier power within Su Yu's world, without the support of his world, they could only exert fourth-tier power.

But once supported by his world, many could exert third-tier ruler of laws power!

Even stronger possibilities existed!

Su Yu didn't say much to everyone, advising them not to place too much hope on his world, but he himself was constantly assessing how far he could go before he could no longer feel the power of his world.

Liu Hong had helped him connect to the River of Time, but Liu Hong's strength was average, and the power he could draw was limited, with a small range of influence.

If Liu Hong were stronger, he could extend the range further.

Su Yu continued forward, with everyone following. The entire group was very quiet.

Su Yu moved slowly, and no one minded. Perhaps they were heading into a fierce battle.

The group was too quiet, and some were not used to it. Heavendoom looked around and, seeing everyone silent, chuckled, "Your Majesty, do we have more rulers of laws than the Human Emperor's side? If we go there, should we seize the Human Emperor's authority?"

Hongmeng scolded, "Shut up!"

Su Yu, however, calmly said, "Seizing authority is meaningless! But we also cannot blindly follow! Remember, just follow my orders! I don't care whose subordinates you were in the past, but once we get there, you can only listen to me! Marquis Nanxi, Marquis Zhennan, Yingwu, Giant Axe... you were all subordinates of certain Human Kings in the past, I know, and I'm not asking you to betray them!"

"I won't have any major conflicts with the Human Emperor... but the Human Emperor and I are different. His decisions, his thoughts, do not necessarily represent mine!"

"Our goals are the same, but the process may not be, so you must listen to me, not the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu had no interest in seizing power from the Human Emperor, and the Human Emperor likely wouldn't seize power from Su Yu either.

However... both were leaders, and it was impossible for them to be completely aligned!

If they were completely aligned, then Su Yu wouldn't be Su Yu, and the Human Emperor wouldn't be the Human Emperor.

As such, small conflicts could easily arise.

Who would be in charge?

Who would have the final say?

When war breaks out, whose people would be the vanguard?

Whose people would be the rear guard?

These could all lead to disputes, and at this time, Su Yu needed to make things clear in advance.

Heavendoom chuckled, "Rest assured, Your Majesty, we only listen to you. After all, we became rulers of laws thanks to you, and besides, our paths are within your world!"

Heavendoom laughed heartily, "Anyone who dares disobey, I'll break their legs for you!"

Sometimes, a king needs someone like Heavendoom by his side.

Or someone like Long Brow!

Perhaps you find them annoying, but you need someone like that to help you express your intentions at times like this.

Su Yu said nothing, clearly not reprimanding, which meant he acknowledged Heavendoom's words.

Wan Tiansheng naturally changed the subject, "Your Majesty, if we arrive and a war breaks out immediately, won't that be troublesome? Can we not go directly but instead meet with the Human Emperor at an intermediate point? Reach some consensus... to avoid conflict as soon as we arrive, knowing nothing."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "That's necessary. Moreover, we should think of a way... to ambush the Myriad Races!"

Su Yu looked around and said, "The River of Time in the Myriad Realms, if torn open, leads to the Myriad Realms! If this River of Time is torn open, does it lead to chaos? If it's chaos... the Myriad Races would have torn it open long ago... I've always been curious about one thing: why haven't the Myriad Races torn open the river and left after confronting the Human Emperor for so many years? Is there something unusual about it?"

Tearing open the river allows for departure.

The Myriad Races haven't torn open the river to leave, either because they can't or because it's more dangerous outside, making it easy to fall.

At this moment, without knowing, Su Yu dared not rashly tear it open. If he fell, it would be disastrous!

And the others didn't know either.

They hadn't gone upstream before!

Su Yu was also pondering one more thing: Xingyue!

Not that he expected Xingyue to do anything, but Xingyue was a core point in his world. The Life and Death Path had always been controlled by Xingyue, and the Life and Death Path could extend somewhat to Xingyue.

So... can I use Xingyue to directly extend my world's power over there?

Xingyue is a very special point.

She connects Su Yu's Life and Death Path, and she also controls the Life Path of the River of Time. Through these three paths, she is actually like Liu Hong and Lantian, able to connect the two.

Moreover, Xingyue is stronger than them.

As for Su Yu himself, he only fused a bit of power into the Physical Body Path, and he didn't fuse much, so it's not very strong. Purely looking at the Physical Body Path, he might not even be stronger than Liu Hong.

Thus, covering this area himself is not easy.

Of course, this time, Su Yu brought the core imprint of the Human Lord Seal, which he could summon at a critical moment, but each summoning would result in a huge loss. Unless absolutely necessary, Su Yu was unwilling to summon it.

Thoughts flickered one after another.

Around him, the sound of heavy breathing gradually rose, partly from exhaustion, partly from anxiety and excitement.

The ancient marquises, Xia Longwu, and others, whether they had seen the Human Emperor, the Battle King, or the Radiant King, had only heard of them. There was some anticipation in meeting these legendary figures.

However, there was also concern that the meeting might not be pleasant.

As for Su Yu, he was contemplating the strength of the Human Emperor.

How did he, back then, lead a group to force the Myriad Races' experts deep into the River of Time?

The further upstream, the greater the pressure!

Now, they were almost overlapping with the Myriad Realms. Back then, the gap with the Myriad Realms was vast. How did the Human Emperor manage to push the Myriad Races to the point where they had to desperately flee forward?

This Human Emperor... Su Yu was actually filled with curiosity.

On one hand, he was curious about his strength, on the other hand, he admired his meticulous planning... though he often got trapped.

He also admired his strong sense of responsibility, something Su Yu couldn't match. Su Yu had a sense of responsibility, but as he said, he only protected what he deemed worthy, whereas the Human Emperor had a broader love.

The Human Emperor...

At this moment, Su Yu was filled with a mix of anticipation and helplessness. He hoped... that this wouldn't be another Hundred Battle King! Or rather, he hoped that his fantasies wouldn't be shattered.

In his eyes, the Human Emperor was powerful, benevolent, and kind... In short, he had an excellent impression of this person. Perhaps he couldn't achieve such greatness himself, or he felt that living like that would be too exhausting, but he believed that such a person should exist and must exist!

However, if the Human Emperor turned out to be less than he expected, Su Yu would be very disappointed.

"I hope... you live up to this title."

Su Yu thought to himself, the Human Emperor, the emperor of the human race. This emperor, who once unified the Myriad Realms, shouldn't be so disappointing. However, he hoped that the emperor would have fewer schemes... or at least fewer schemes against his side. Scheming was inevitable; if the emperor had none, he would be a fool, and a fool couldn't have led the human race for countless years.

At this moment, Su Yu was actually quite anxious. He... was bringing along a group of rulers of laws! Many people trusted Su Yu, which was why they were willing to fight.

Including himself, there were 36 people coming along, and Su Yu hoped that when they returned to the Myriad Realms, there would still be 36, with none missing. Losing any of them would be a blow to Su Yu.

As these thoughts surfaced, Su Yu's Life and Death Path fluctuated slightly, signaling Xingyue, "I... am coming soon!"

...

At the same time.

On one of the two opposing continents, Xingyue was helping several elderly people who had been injured for years. Suddenly, her expression changed. In the next moment, she abandoned the elderly she was treating and ran off.

The elderly man was left speechless. What happened? Am I beyond saving? You're running so fast, does that mean I'm about to die soon? I don't feel anything!

"Your Highness, how much longer do I have to live?" he shouted, wanting a straightforward answer. Why are you running?

"I don't know!"

"......"

Xingyue's reply made the old man sigh. What does that mean? Is it meant to comfort me, or does it mean I could die at any moment? It's really complicated!

He got up and stopped caring, shouting, "Brothers, I'm about to die. Does anyone have anything to eat? It's been so long, my mouth is practically dry. If anyone has something to eat, give me a bite..."

It's too miserable! Here, there's been nothing to eat for a long time.

Of course, someone quickly joked, "Food? There's none left, but the Dragon Emperor on the other side is still alive. We could slaughter him and have a full dragon feast. Anyone want to go and kill him?"

"......"

The old man was speechless. Nonsense, I want to do it too, I want to eat, but the Dragon Emperor is very strong, and I can't beat him!

They were chatting away.

Not far away, a shadow hovered on one side of the river. The Human Emperor's shadow had been hovering there for many years, responsible for deterring the other side. The Human Emperor didn't want to start a war, but he was also helpless.

Although he didn't want to start a war, reinforcements from the rear had been delayed for so long that sooner or later, he would have to engage in a great battle with the other side!

Currently, the Myriad Races only feared him. Once they returned to the Myriad Realms... some things couldn't be hidden!

In fact, by now, he was almost unable to hold on.

The shadow gazed at the front, as it had for many years, silently watching the other side, lost in thought. Sometimes, he would look at the old brothers beside him, who had followed him without hesitation back then, driving the Myriad Races into the River of Time together.

Over the years, many of the old brothers had died in battle.

Of the 36 ancient human kings, quite a few had died.

Later, some ancient marquises advanced and filled these gaps.

When they left, they brought over 300 people!

Now, only about 120 remain.

More than half had died or been injured!

Of course, the other side had also suffered heavy losses. In the past, the other side had over a hundred rulers of laws and brought nearly 500 ancient marquises, totaling over 600 strong individuals. Now, only about 200 remain.

The number of ancient marquises left on both sides was about the same, but there was still a significant gap in the number of rulers of laws.

The other side had over 120 rulers of laws and about a hundred ancient marquises left.

On the human side, there were over 40 rulers of laws and over 80 ancient marquises.

Combined, they were about the same number as the rulers of laws on the other side.

The Human Emperor's thoughts were racing.

What was the situation at the rear now?

After so many years of obstruction... if there were no changes at the rear, then all the efforts would have been in vain, with so many people dying, and yet no changes occurring afterward.

Sometimes, the Human Emperor felt very tired.

Back then, they paid such a huge price to drive away the Myriad Races' strong individuals, leaving many strong humans behind, and yet after countless years, the humans hadn't won... Sometimes, it was truly frustrating to the point of explosion.

In the past, the Myriad Races' foundation was swept away by him, and the human foundation was deep, yet they still couldn't account for everything!

The Culture King and Martial King had also not returned for a long time, indicating that there were changes within the Heaven Gate.

As thoughts flickered, he sensed his sister's arrival and turned his head to look, smiling lightly, "What's wrong?"

"He's coming!"

"Hmm?"

"My subordinate, Su Yu, didn't I tell you?"

Xingyue was displeased. I told you, didn't I? Did you not take it seriously?

The Human Emperor was slightly taken aback. Su Yu... was coming!

This newly risen young man, rumored to be only in his twenties, opened the heavens and often caused trouble for him. Was he really coming?

He hadn't opened the heavens for long, right?

Not just not long, here, the flow of time was different from the Myriad Realms. Xingyue had left the Myriad Realms less than half a year ago.

And here, even though they were close to the Myriad Realms, and the flow of time had accelerated significantly, in reality, only about seven days had passed for the Human Emperor.

Roughly one day equaled a month!

Here, one day, and a month had passed in the Myriad Realms.

Of course, the deeper they went, the slower time became.

But the speed was meaningless; they were actually moving closer to the Myriad Realms.

For others, Xingyue hadn't been here for long, and at their level, a few days and a few months didn't really make a difference.

The Human Emperor thought to himself, but the shadow let out a laugh, "It's good that he's coming, it's good! You previously returned with your willpower, how is his strength now? Can he bring three to five rulers of laws as reinforcements?"

It felt... like there were rulers of laws being born before, but they seemed to have fallen quickly!

Xingyue's side was also unclear.

The Human Emperor didn't really know much about Su Yu's side.

The only communication channel was Xingyue.

But Xingyue...

Sure enough, Xingyue was still the same, dismissively saying, "Who knows, I'm too lazy to ask about his situation. He's my subordinate, so his strength is just so-so!"

"......"

The Human Emperor sighed inwardly. You're really dismissive of me.

You've gone to fight, and then you come back and tell me you don't know how things are on his side, don't know his strength, don't know anything.

Do I believe you?

Is there a need to hide it from me?

The Human Emperor felt tired and asked again, "When will he arrive?"

"I don't know, but he's probably on the move, so it should be soon!"

The Human Emperor fell into contemplation, and Xingyue added, "Oh, he said last time that when he comes, keep it a secret! To prevent the Myriad Races from suddenly erupting, and also, brother, do you need any help? He said if you need it, you can ask..."

Help?

The Human Emperor sighed inwardly. How strong is Su Yu?

He judged that he wouldn't be too weak.

Perhaps... he had reached the third tier.

In his own world, he should have reached the third tier, right?

If he came, he definitely couldn't bring his world with him, so he would only have the fourth tier, which was the conventional power of a ruler of laws.

Even if pseudo-dao rulers of laws were born in his world, if they really came, they would probably only be fifth tier.

Assuming he was lucky, and had five or six rulers of laws under him, they would be five or six fifth-tier rulers of laws... which actually wouldn't make much of a difference. One fourth-tier, plus five or six fifth-tier, the Human Emperor was already overestimating him.

The main thing was that Su Yu himself had detached from the River of Time, and those under him had also chosen to merge with Su Yu's dao.

The Human Emperor could only judge this way.

Judging five or six rulers of laws wasn't really underestimating Su Yu.

"That's not bad..."

The Human Emperor thought to himself, it's okay, it's better than nothing.

After so many years, finally, the first batch of reinforcements had arrived, and perhaps it would be the only batch. It would help boost morale, at least Su Yu had pacified the chaos in the Myriad Realms!

From this perspective, this kid was worthy of his title as the Human Lord.

The tenth generation Human Lord... the previous nine generations were all failures, the Human Emperor was also helpless, but still, one shouldn't be too greedy. At least the tenth generation Human Lord arrived at the last moment!

"Brother!"

Xingyue spoke, "I asked if you need any help!"

"......"

The Human Emperor was helpless. At my level, even a third-tier Life Master like you can't help me, let alone Su Yu. Moreover, Xingyue had recently made some progress, feeling... close to the second tier?

The Human Emperor's thoughts wandered again, second tier... unfortunately, I can't wait for it. If Xingyue reached the first tier, maybe she could help me, but now she hasn't even reached the second tier.

Thoughts scattered...

The Human Emperor's heart tightened!

Had it come to this?

Now, a single sentence could easily send him into deep thought, clearly not a good sign!

Quickly, he steadied his mind and smiled, "I don't need any help, your brother is incredibly strong. What can a newcomer do to help? It's good that he's coming, he can contribute a bit..."

Xingyue raised an eyebrow, "Who are you looking down on? My subordinate has some skills!"

I don't like hearing that!

The Human Emperor chuckled, speaking softly, "Alright, he must have some skills. Without skills, he couldn't have opened the heavens! I acknowledge that! Since he's your subordinate... go and welcome him, I can't leave rashly..."

He couldn't leave!

After thinking for a moment, he added, "Let the Battle King accompany you, the Radiant King can't leave either, leaving would easily be discovered!"

The strong individuals here couldn't leave rashly.

They were blocking the other side from leaving, and the other side was actually entangling them, preventing them from leaving. Otherwise, if the Human Emperor's people left downstream, wouldn't the Myriad Realms be in trouble?

Over the years, both sides have been entangled with each other. If you leave for a short while, the other side might probe, and if your people don't show up, a large-scale war could break out. Once a powerful figure leaves, it could lead to an imbalance in the entire battle situation!

"Brother, can't you go?" Xingyue hesitated. "He's very concerned about face. If you don't go, and he feels slighted, what if he turns around and leaves?"

"......"

The Human Emperor felt exhausted! I'm the Human Emperor, and at such a critical moment in the battle, I'm already giving face by letting you and the Battle King go to greet a few weak rulers of laws. Isn't that enough? Do I have to personally go and greet them?

Forget it!

The Human Emperor was speechless. If my side gets breached because of a few weak rulers of laws, that would be truly lamentable!

Of course, he couldn't say it like that. The Human Emperor smiled and said, "He's also a Human Lord. He should know how dangerous the battle situation is right now. Help me explain a bit. Once we take down the Myriad Races, I'll give him a proper reception..."

Just pleasantries!

Xingyue, however, took it seriously and nodded. "Alright! I'll talk to him to prevent any grudges!"

The Human Emperor couldn't help but say, "This Su Yu you speak of... doesn't seem very broad-minded!"

Xingyue was puzzled. "He's not broad-minded, is he? Haven't I mentioned that?"

Is Su Yu broad-minded? No, he doesn't even have a mind for such things! Not broad-minded, others might have some, but he has none at all. This guy is the type to seek revenge overnight, extremely petty!

The Human Emperor felt exhausted again, suddenly realizing that this person might not be easy to deal with. Not that he was afraid, as the other was quite weak, but he worried that the person might think they were the best in the world, having roamed the Myriad Realms with a group of Heavenly Kings, and upon coming here, might think rulers of laws are nothing... which could lead to annoying some people.

Such things are common. In the era of the Myriad Realms without rulers of laws, some might think they are the best! Thinking they're amazing! But upon arriving here, they become nothing, and yet they arrogantly provoke strong enemies... The Human Emperor especially feared such pig teammates!

Because, he's been burned before!

Now, he's very afraid of encountering another group of such troublemakers!

Xingyue seemed to know what he was thinking and quickly said, "Su Yu is still quite capable! If he wasn't, how could he have conquered the Death Realm, taken the Upper Realm, expelled the Myriad Races, and dominated the Three Realms! His achievements are even greater than yours, brother..."

The Human Emperor chuckled!

Blow it up!

Keep blowing!

Goodness, suddenly he's even more powerful than me, tsk tsk, as if I'm not impressive!

Conquered the Three Realms?

I admit, Su Yu is capable, but considering the current state of the Myriad Races, it's possible they might have self-destructed!

Bah!

I can tolerate boasting, but boasting to be more powerful than me, I can't quite accept that!

The Human Emperor smiled faintly and said, "Is that so? Then I'll be watching closely! Ah Yue, you didn't experience my conquest of the Myriad Races... After you had your incident, your brother and a group of old comrades fought across the Myriad Realms, sweeping all directions, undefeated in the world!"

Do you know?

It's a pity you didn't experience my era. Xingyue had her incident quite early, before the Human Realm was completely unified.

By the time the Human Realm was unified and the heavens were conquered, Xingyue hadn't seen or experienced those glorious achievements!

Xingyue nodded. Her brother was indeed impressive. She casually asked, "Brother, how many years did it take you to conquer the Myriad Realms?"

"Just over a hundred years..."

"Oh!"

Xingyue didn't say much. The Human Emperor saw her indifferent reaction and seemed to remember something, his shadow trembling. "It's different. Back then, every realm had strong individuals, especially the Immortal, Demon, Divine, and Dragon races, all had powerful beings stationed... Each realm was very difficult to conquer..."

"Oh!"

Xingyue nodded, then said, "I'll go call Brother Battle King."

"No, listen to me first!"

The Human Emperor was angry!

Your attitude is too perfunctory!

I'm very upset!

"Back in the day, I..."

"Got it, brother, I'll listen when I get back!"

Xingyue nodded. I heard you, I'll listen when I return. I still need to satisfy my brother's desire to show off, but it seems Su Yu is arriving soon, so I should go call the Battle King first.

The Human Emperor was furious!

"Wait a moment!"

Xingyue obediently stood still.

Only then did the Human Emperor snort with satisfaction and continue, "Back in the day, those guys across from us, who wasn't trembling when they saw me? Don't be fooled by their numbers; they were still beaten to their knees, begging for mercy! It's a pity... your brother, I, was unlucky!"

With a sigh, he continued, "Your Brother Wen was a pit! He was actually okay, but your Brother Taishan... that was a huge pit, a divine pit!"

He didn't want to say anything more!

That big fool, who knows if he was instigated by that bastard Control King, made the departure of the Culture King known to everyone.

Otherwise, give me another thousand years, and I wouldn't fear the Myriad Races!

Unfortunately, at that time, undercurrents were surging, and to eliminate future troubles, I had to abandon the plan to continue opening the heavens and came up with a drastic solution.

Now, I'm severely injured, unlucky.

The Culture King and the others are still unable to return, and the Myriad Realms over there are unreliable. You could say, there's not a single thing going smoothly!

If it weren't for this... I would have already led people to break into the Three Gates!

The Human Emperor looked up at the sky, feeling a bit desolate.

The end of a hero!

What about the Three Gates?

I would still suppress them!

It's just that time wasn't on my side, leading to repeated defeats, failing at the last moment!

In the past, I even wanted to compete with the Master of Time, but now, I've given up on that idea.

At this moment, he was lost in thought again. He wasn't like this before, but it's been too long, his sea of will is loosening, somewhat collapsing, reaching this point, he... really can't hold on much longer!

"Man can conquer heaven... but can't conquer man!"

A sigh of endless lamentation!

At this moment, Xingyue vaguely sensed her brother's desolation, thought for a moment, and said seriously, "It's okay, my subordinate is here!"

"......"

Go to hell!

You seriously telling me your subordinate is here, what use is that!

"Go, go!"

The Human Emperor waved his hand, pretending he didn't hear.

Soon, the Human Emperor transmitted a message to the distant Battle King: "Accompany Xingyue to meet the tenth generation Human Lord, Su Yu, the one who opened the heavens in the Sun and Moon... Be polite, although his strength is average, his willingness to come to aid is a blessing for our human race! Unite all forces that can be united... If he has any requests... agree if you can, if it's excessive, just say you can't decide and wait for my notification!"

In the distance, the Battle King, with a fierce aura, heard this and his eyes moved slightly, transmitting a message: "Your Majesty, will there be any trouble? I'm just afraid that the people coming from the rear have high ambitions, can't help, and instead cause trouble for us..."

"It's fine, I could suppress you all back then, let alone him? Just be polite, if the Radiant King wasn't tied up, he would be more suitable, he knows how to deal with these youngsters... As for you... just play dumb!"

"Your Majesty, saying that, I'm still an elder, playing dumb in front of juniors... how embarrassing!"

"Stop talking nonsense!"

The Human Emperor transmitted again: "Also, when you go, explain the power comparison and such, not too detailed, but also don't let them think they're safe here! You have a sense of proportion!"

The Human Emperor gave a few more instructions, then said, "Right, if he says he won't follow orders... don't bother with him, just say you'll arrange a king position for him, let him lead his subordinates... as long as he doesn't actively trigger a war, let him be!"

His attitude towards Su Yu was welcoming, but he wasn't too keen on integrating Su Yu into the current system, as that might lead to problems.

And thinking from Su Yu's perspective, having conquered the Three Realms, with ambitions as high as the sky, he probably wouldn't be willing to be subordinate either, which was fine, as long as he wasn't too foolish.

The Battle King silently nodded, taking note of everything.

Soon, he transmitted with a smile: "Your Majesty, rest assured, I'll let him know what reality is! I'll intimidate them a bit! I'm worried they might not make it here, which would be embarrassing..."

Hearing this, the Human Emperor was stunned, that shouldn't be, right?

If they can't even make it here... cough cough, that would be quite embarrassing!

"Wait at the border for a while, not too long, to avoid being discovered by the Myriad Races. If they haven't arrived... then come back first!"

They might really not make it.

You know, Xingyue restored her strength, carrying the Xingyu Imprint, barely made it here, if Su Yu's side is weak and without the Xingyu Imprint, my goodness... if they really can't make it, that would be embarrassing!

The Battle King chuckled: "Alright, I got it, Your Majesty, I'll go take a look first! If they really come, seeing me... they might be scared to death, I'll let them know what a strong person is, to prevent them from being too ambitious, fearing no one, and causing trouble for Your Majesty!"

"Be mindful of your limits!"

"Rest assured, Your Majesty!"

The Battle King was carefree, don't worry!

I know what I'm doing!

These young ones, I can't handle them?

This Su Yu, he's heard a few things from Xingyue, heard he's from the Great Xia Prefecture... Great Xia Prefecture, supposedly founded by his descendants, not sure which generation's descendants.

Speaking of which, maybe I'm the ancestor of Su Yu's ancestor's ancestor...

Moments later, the Battle King and Xingyue left quietly, heading to the rear.

Some people saw them, but didn't pay much attention, as people would occasionally patrol the rear to prevent surprise attacks from the Myriad Realms.

As for the Myriad Races, they didn't pay much attention either.

The Battle King leaving for a while was no big deal.

However, if they didn't sense his aura for two or three days, the Myriad Races would launch an attack to prevent the Battle King and others from leaving and returning to the Myriad Realms!

...

Meanwhile.

Su Yu also arrived at the area where Xingyue had previously broken the seal. This place wasn't too far from the Human Emperor and his group.

Su Yu looked back, frowning slightly. Before this, he couldn't sense the radiation range of his own world anymore, which was a bit troublesome!

"What a pity!"

Su Yu thought to himself, it was indeed a pity!

If it could spread a bit further, it might even reach the area where the Human Emperor resides. That would be delightful!

Soon, Su Yu looked ahead. The Life and Death Path rippled slightly as Xingyue transmitted a message. The distance between them wasn't far, so the message was clear. The Human Emperor couldn't leave, and at this moment, Xingyue was accompanying the Hundred Battle King, advancing in this direction.

The Hundred Battle King!

Su Yu thought to himself and quickly turned to Xia Longwu with a smile. "Your ancestor is coming!"

Xia Longwu's expression remained stern as he nodded slightly. He didn't pay much attention to it. After all, the generations were too far apart, and there was no familial affection. Of course, if they spent more time together, there might be some, but clearly, that wasn't the case now.

Everyone had their own positions and loyalties. Ten thousand years had passed, and who knows how many generations had come and gone? Even if a family of cultivators had a generation every few hundred years, there would still be hundreds of generations. The relationship was too distant, and Xia Longwu truly didn't care much about these things.

Others, however, were somewhat excited. "The Hundred Battle King is coming?"

Someone snorted, "And yet the Human Emperor isn't coming to greet him personally..."

Su Yu snapped, "Shut up! Just be polite and that's it. If he really came, and the front line fell, would you go and hold the line?"

"..."

Alright, that flattery was misplaced.

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with them and turned to the Martial Emperor, smiling. "The Hundred Battle King was a third-class back then, but now... at least a second-class! I understand the Human Emperor's thoughts, and frankly, I share them. We're both wary! It's necessary to intimidate me a bit to keep me in line... but we need to show some strength too! Martial Emperor, later when the Hundred Battle King might unleash his aura, don't mind him. Once he does, Martial Emperor, Undead Emperor, and March, the three of you go and give him a good beating to show our strength!"

The Undead Emperor was roughly around third-class now. As for March, he was also third-class, perhaps even a strong third-class. No choice, he had acquired the bamboo pole, and Su Yu had directly integrated it into his path, making March's strength surpass that of the South Heavenly King and others.

Two third-class and one second-class; if the Hundred Battle King isn't first-class, they could probably take him down in a spar!

"Beat the Hundred Battle King?"

March grinned, "Is that appropriate?"

The Martial Emperor's eyes flickered. Can I really hit him? Beating up the Hundred Battle King would be quite satisfying!

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "All of you, keep your auras tightly restrained. The Hundred Battle King will definitely take the initiative to unleash his aura to intimidate us... We won't provoke trouble, but if someone tries to intimidate us... I won't say a word, but you guys... go beat him up!"

Everyone understood, and soon, a series of chuckles arose as they all quickly restrained their auras.

Got it!

Su Yu wanted to save face and not bully the Hundred Battle King, but as subordinates, they needed to share their master's burdens. They understood this logic!

If the Hundred Battle King started trouble first and got beaten up, it would be for nothing!

Nearby, Xia Longwu's mouth twitched slightly. After all, he was still my ancestor... This... Forget it, I won't interfere!

This was also a test, a confrontation between both sides. On one hand, it was about having a voice, and on the other, it was to ensure that the other side wouldn't underestimate Su Yu's side, lest they think Su Yu's side was weak and could be easily manipulated, which would cause problems later on.

...

"Hmm..."

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King rubbed his nose, feeling a bit itchy!

As he walked forward, he chuckled, "Sister Xingyue, tell me, should I use thirty percent of my strength to intimidate them later, or fifty percent? You decide, since you say they're your subordinates... it's up to you!"

The Hundred Battle King laughed heartily, feeling a bit excited. It had been so many years since he had seen newcomers!

Xingyue hesitated for a moment. Su Yu seemed to be saying something. She hesitated again and quickly said, "Use all your strength! If that's not enough... then don't intimidate them, Brother Battle... I'm afraid..."

"Afraid I'll scare them?"

The Hundred Battle King laughed loudly, "Don't worry, I know my limits! I'm not a villain, just letting them know the front line is dangerous..."

Alright!

Xingyue nodded. Do as you please. I think you're going to have bad luck, but never mind, I'll help heal you later, don't worry!
