Chapter 837: He's Here! (Please Subscribe)

In the River of Time.

Su Yu led his people upstream, and soon, they reached a point. Su Yu knew where this was: the entrance to the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion!

Below this, there was a ruler of laws who had stayed behind and died in battle, Yue Wang!

This time, Marquis Huoyun didn't come.

Su Yu looked down at this node for a while, then calmly said, “This is the point where they ultimately return. When they arrive here, the Myriad Realms and they will overlap!”

“Going upstream, time slows down. While we were there for a day, perhaps a long time has passed here!”

“Therefore, those who stayed behind might have progressed faster than us. So even if everyone has reached the level of a ruler of laws, do not slack off!”

Behind him, over 30 powerhouses nodded in unison.

The Martial Emperor, however, was dismissive, muttering under his breath. Su Yu’s gaze suddenly turned cold. He looked back at the Martial Emperor and said chillingly, “Normally, I’m too lazy to bother with you! Do you think that just because you’ve entered the Second Tier, you can act without restraint? Martial Emperor, I’m reiterating this: my orders are absolute! I will govern you by military law. If you make even the slightest mistake, I will execute you!”

The Martial Emperor’s heart tightened.

He had entered the Second Tier. Su Yu, currently without his domain covering him, was actually about the same as him. But under Su Yu’s sternness at this moment, the Martial Emperor felt a chill.

Su Yu… truly kills people!

This guy wasn’t the first to kill troublemakers on the battlefield.

Su Yu’s expression was indifferent. He no longer looked at him, turning his gaze forward. The River of Time, going upstream. If the commotion was too great and attracted the attention of the Myriad Races, a major battle might erupt.

Although he brought many people, even adding the existing Human Race, there were only about 80 rulers of laws. The enemy, however, had over 100.

The Human Emperor’s combat power was depleted. At this moment, a sudden major battle was not a good thing!

If the Human Emperor fell, the Human Race would inevitably be defeated.

Because at this moment, Su Yu still couldn’t control the rulers of laws on the Human Emperor’s side. Those veteran rulers of laws had followed the Human Emperor in countless battles over countless years; they weren’t people anyone could control.

Even the Great Zhou King, who had been with them day and night, would choose the Human Emperor between the Human Emperor and Su Yu, let alone those others.

So if the Human Emperor died, Su Yu wouldn’t be able to control those guys. Moreover, some of them must be stronger than Su Yu!

Leaving others aside, has the Second Tier Radiant King from back then not reached the First Tier now?

Have people like Zhan Wang not reached the First Tier?

These were all uncertain matters.

And on the other side, there must be First Tiers. Among the Emperors of major races like the Immortal, Devil, Divine, Dragon, and Nether Races, has not a single one reached the First Tier after all these years?

If not a single one had, that would be too pathetic!

The Myriad Races were not useless.

It was just that the Myriad Races were scattered, always harboring ulterior motives. It was difficult for them to be united until a life-or-death moment. For example, Tiangu and his group, Tiangu only managed to command those people at the very last moment.

Otherwise, if the Myriad Races were united, how could the Human Race possibly contend with them?

Su Yu continued upstream, not moving quickly.

He was drawing upon the power of his domain, wanting to extend its coverage.

But… Su Yu also discovered that the further away from the Myriad Realms, the harder it was for his domain’s power to extend its coverage.

At this moment, he could still draw some power over, but Su Yu judged that perhaps before reaching the Human Emperor’s side, his domain’s power would completely lose its ability to cover.

There would be a node for this!

Beyond this node, he was just an ordinary Second Tier. Although everyone’s strength had been enhanced by him, they were still just a group of ordinary Fourth Tier rulers of laws.

Yes, just Fourth Tier!

Even if they drew upon their past selves, even if some Fourth Tiers could exert Third Tier power within Su Yu’s domain, without the domain’s support, they could only exert Fourth Tier power.

But once they had the domain’s support, many people could exert the power of Third Tier rulers of laws!

Even the possibility of being stronger existed!

Su Yu didn’t say anything to everyone, telling them not to hold too much hope for the domain. However, he himself was constantly gauging how far they could go before he could no longer feel the domain’s covering power.

Liu Hong helped him connect to the River of Time, but Liu Hong’s strength was only average. The power he drew was insufficient, and the radiation range was not large. Liu Hong, being a bit stronger, could radiate over a longer range.

Su Yu continued forward, the others followed, the entire team was very quiet.

Su Yu’s movements were slow, but no one cared. Perhaps once they arrived, it would be a fierce battle.

The team was too quiet, and some were unaccustomed to it. Heavendoom looked left and right, and seeing that no one was speaking, he chuckled, “Your Majesty, with so many rulers of laws, do we have more than the Human Emperor’s side? If we go, are we going to seize the Human Emperor’s authority?”

Hongmeng heard this and reprimanded, “Shut up!”

Su Yu, however, calmly said, “No seizing of authority, it’s meaningless! But, we also cannot blindly follow! Everyone remember one thing: you only need to listen to my orders! I don’t care whose subordinates you were back then, but once we’re there, you can only listen to me! Marquis Nanxi, Marquis Zhennan, Yingwu, Giant Axe… I know you were all subordinates of a certain Human King back then, and I’m not asking you to betray your former master!”

“The Human Emperor and I won’t have any major conflicts… but the Human Emperor and I are different. The Human Emperor’s decisions, the Human Emperor’s thoughts, don’t necessarily represent my thoughts!”

“Our goals are the same, but the process may not be consistent. Therefore, you must listen to me, not the Human Emperor, once we arrive!”

Su Yu had no interest in seizing authority from the Human Emperor, and the Human Emperor, in all likelihood, wouldn’t try to seize authority from Su Yu either.

But… they were both leaders, and it was impossible for them to be completely identical!

If they were completely identical, then Su Yu wouldn’t be Su Yu, and the Human Emperor wouldn’t be the Human Emperor.

In this way, small conflicts were still likely to arise.

Who would be in charge?

Who would have the final say?

If a major battle erupted, whose people would be the vanguard?

Whose people would cover the rear?

These could all lead to disputes. At such a time, Su Yu didn’t need others to do anything; he would negotiate with the Human Emperor. What he feared was subordinates acting recklessly.

Some things, Su Yu still had to make clear in advance.

Heavendoom chuckled and said, “Your Majesty, rest assured, we only listen to Your Majesty. After all, we all became rulers of laws thanks to Your Majesty. Moreover, the Great Dao are all within Your Majesty’s domain!”

Heavendoom laughed heartily, “Whoever dares to disobey, I’ll help Your Majesty break their legs!”

Sometimes, a king needed someone like Heavendoom by his side.

Or someone like Long Eyebrow!

Perhaps you disliked them, but you needed such people to help voice your intentions at such times.

Su Yu said nothing, clearly, not reprimanding meant he approved of Heavendoom’s words.

Wan Tiansheng also naturally changed the topic: “Your Majesty, if a war breaks out as soon as we arrive, won’t that be very troublesome? Can we not go directly, but instead meet with the Human Emperor and his people at an intermediate point first? Reach some consensus… to avoid conflicts erupting as soon as we arrive, without knowing anything.”

Su Yu nodded slightly. “That is necessary. Not only that, we should also try to think of a way… to ambush the Myriad Races!”

Su Yu looked around and said, “If the River of Time in the Myriad Realms is torn open, it leads to the Myriad Realms! If the River of Time here is torn open, does it lead to Chaos? If it leads to Chaos… the Myriad Races would have torn it open and left long ago… I’ve always been curious about one thing: the Myriad Races and the Human Emperor have been

At this moment, Su Yu felt a mix of anticipation and helplessness. He hoped… this wouldn't be another Hundred Battle King!

Or rather, he didn't want his illusions to be shattered.

In his eyes, the Human Emperor was powerful, benevolent, and kind… In short, he had an excellent impression of the man. *Perhaps I can't be like him, or I feel that such a person lives too tiring a life, and I don't want to become that kind of person!*

*But such people should exist, and must exist!*

Yet, if the Human Emperor turned out to be less than he expected, Su Yu would be deeply disappointed.

“I hope… you live up to that title.”

Su Yu thought to himself, *Human Emperor, the Emperor of the human race.*

This Emperor, who once unified the Myriad Realms, shouldn't be so disappointing. However, Su Yu hoped he would be less prone to schemes… or at least fewer schemes and calculations directed at his own side. Schemes, he certainly had and would employ; if he had none, he'd be an idiot, and an idiot couldn't have ruled the human race for countless years.

At this moment, Su Yu was actually quite nervous.

He… was bringing a group of rulers of laws with him!

Many of them trusted Su Yu, believed in Su Yu, which was why they were willing to fight.

Including himself, 36 people had come together. Su Yu hoped that when they returned to the Myriad Realms, there

These past years, both sides had been entangled with each other.

If one side left for even a short period, the other might probe. If their people didn't appear, a large-scale war could erupt, and the departure of a powerful individual could lead to the entire war situation becoming unbalanced!

"Brother, you can't go?"

Xingyue hesitated, "He cares a lot about his reputation. If you don't go, and he feels you're disrespecting him, what if he just turns around and leaves?"

"..."

The Human Emperor felt mentally exhausted!

I'm the Human Emperor, for crying out loud! At a time when the war is tense, I'm sending you and the War King to welcome a few weak rulers of laws. I've already shown enough respect!

So, you're saying that's not enough?

Do I have to go personally to welcome him?

Forget it!

The Human Emperor was speechless. Don't let a few weak rulers of laws cause my side to be breached; that would be truly beyond tears!

Of course, he couldn't say that directly. The Human Emperor smiled, "He is also a Human Lord. He should understand the dangers of the current war. Help me explain a few things. Once we've taken down the Myriad Races, I will treat him well..."

They were just pleasantries!

Xingyue, however, took it seriously. She nodded, "Alright then! I'll talk to him about it, so he doesn't hold a grudge!"

The Human Emperor couldn't help himself. "This Su Yu you speak of... he's quite... small-minded, isn't he?"

Xingyue looked puzzled. "He is small-minded, didn't I say that?"

Is Su Yu broad-minded?

No, he has no 'mind'

If it could spread a bit further, perhaps reaching the Human Emperor's area, that would be awesome!

Soon, Su Yu looked ahead.

The Life and Death Path rippled slightly. Xingyue sent a message; the two sides weren't far apart, so the message was clear. The Human Emperor couldn't leave, and at this moment, Xingyue was accompanying Zhan Wang, heading this way.

Zhan Wang!

Su Yu thought to himself. Soon, he turned his head to look at Xia Longwu and smiled, “Your old ancestor is coming!”

Xia Longwu's expression was stern as he nodded slightly.

He didn't pay much mind to it!

There was nothing he could do; too many generations separated them. Any familial affection was non-existent. Of course, it might develop over time, but clearly, there was none now.

Everyone had their own stance, serving their own master!

A hundred thousand years—who knew how many generations had passed!

A hundred years per generation, that's already a thousand generations!

Even for cultivator families, with a few hundred years per generation, it would still be hundreds of generations. The relationship was too distant; Xia Longwu truly didn't care much about it.

The others, however, were somewhat excited: “Zhan Wang is here?”

Someone grumbled, “The Human Emperor isn't even coming to greet him personally…”

Su Yu retorted irritably, “Shut up! A little courtesy is enough. If he really came, and the front line fell, would you all go and take its place?”

“…”

Alright, they'd flattered the wrong person.

Su Yu, too lazy to bother, looked at the Martial Emperor again and smiled, “Zhan Wang was a third-tier back then, but now… he's at least a second-tier! I understand the Human Emperor's intentions, and frankly, I'm the same—afraid of both sides! It's necessary to intimidate me a bit to make me obedient… but we also need to show our strength! Martial Emperor, Zhan Wang might unleash his aura later. Don't mind him. The moment he does… Martial Emperor, Undead Emperor, and March, the three of you, go at him together. Beat him up first, and show our strength!”

The Undead Emperor was currently around third-tier.

As for March, he was also third-tier, perhaps even a strong third-tier. There was nothing for it; he had obtained the bamboo pole, and Su Yu had directly integrated it into his Great Dao. March's current strength surpassed that of the South Heavenly King and the others.

Two third-tiers and one second-tier. If Zhan Wang wasn't first-tier, they could probably take him down in a spar!

“Beat up Zhan Wang?”

March grimaced, “Is that appropriate?”

The Martial Emperor's eyes also flickered. This… could he really fight?

Beating up Zhan Wang would be satisfying too!

Su Yu narrowed his eyes and chuckled, “All of you, suppress your auras completely. Zhan Wang will definitely unleash his aura to intimidate us… We won't seek trouble or provoke him, but if he uses his pressure to intimidate us… I won't say a word. The rest of you… beat him up!”

Everyone understood. Soon, a series of chuckles rose, and in an instant, they all suppressed their auras.

Understood!

Su Yu wanted to save face and wouldn't bully Zhan Wang, but as subordinates, they had to share their master's burdens. They understood this principle!

Zhan Wang started it first, so if he got beaten, he got beaten for nothing!

Beside them, Xia Longwu's mouth twitched slightly. He was still his old ancestor, after all… This… Forget it, he wouldn't interfere!

This could be considered a test and a confrontation between the two sides.

On one hand, it was for the right to speak; on the other, it was to prevent the other side from underestimating Su Yu's group. If they thought Su Yu's side was weak and could be easily manipulated, problems would arise later.

…

“Hmph hmph…”

At this moment, Zhan Wang rubbed his nose, feeling a slight itch!

Walking forward, he chuckled, “Sister Xingyue, tell me, later, should I use thirty percent of my strength to intimidate them, or fifty percent? You speak up, you said they're your subordinates… so you decide!”

Zhan Wang laughed heartily. It had been so many years since he'd seen newcomers; he was suddenly a little excited!

Xingyue hesitated. Su Yu seemed to be saying something. She hesitated again, then quickly said, “One hundred percent! If that doesn't work… then don't intimidate them, Big Brother Zhan… I'm scared…”

“Scared I'll frighten them?”

Zhan Wang burst into laughter. “Don't worry, I know my limits! I'm not some villain; I just want them to understand the dangers of the front line…”

Alright!

Xingyue nodded. She decided to let him be, thinking he was about to have bad luck. *Never mind,* she thought, *I'll help him with medical treatment later, so he shouldn't worry!*
