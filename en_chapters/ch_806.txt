Chapter 806: Relying on Oneself is Better Than Relying on Others

Lower Realm.

Human Realm.

As Yue Luo and Yue Xiao tore through the skies, Hundred Battle was observing the heavens. Upon seeing Yue Luo and Yue Xiao, the gathered powerhouses reacted differently—some frowned, some remained indifferent, while others greeted them with smiles.

As the literary leader of Hundred Battle, Changqing noticed that Hundred Battle was still observing the heavens. He quickly smiled and said, "Yue Luo and Yue Xiao have arrived. Your Majesty sensed the fluctuations of the River of Time and has been observing it. You two have traveled a long way; it must have been tiring!"

Changqing's smile was radiant. Beside him, Wu Ji merely curled his lips, showing no interest in the newcomers.

They were from the Control King's lineage!

Though they had pledged allegiance to Hundred Battle, Wu Ji still looked down on such people. They were always betraying someone—first the Control King betrayed the Human Race, then Yue Luo and his group betrayed the Control King. Who knew whom they might betray next?

Yue Luo paid them no mind, nodding slightly at Changqing before looking towards Hundred Battle.

Hundred Battle continued to observe the heavens. After a while, he finally lowered his head and spoke softly, "Did Ji'er send you back?"

"Yes," Yue Luo nodded slightly.

Hundred Battle spoke softly, "The Control King's lineage has been defeated?"

"Consider it a defeat!" Yue Luo quickly replied, "Except for Yue Zhan, all the Heavenly Sovereigns have perished. Nearly all the quasi-kings are dead or wounded, and less than one in ten of the Dao Integration experts remain!"

"Defeated, indeed!" Hundred Battle sighed, and the expressions of those in the hall changed slightly.

They had sensed the fluctuations of the River of Time, but they hadn't expected such significant changes in the Upper Realm.

Yue Luo continued, "On the Demon Race's side, Demon Heaven has fallen, Marquis Ziyun is dead, and Demon Sovereign Mo has fled with the remnants of the Demon Race to an unknown location."

The crowd's expressions changed again.

Hundred Battle sighed softly, "Su Yu?"

"It was him!"

"What about the losses of the Myriad Races and Su Yu?"

Everyone listened intently.

Yue Luo was silent for a moment before speaking, "On Su Yu's side, no one died. Xuelan and Giant Bamboo self-destructed their Great Daos, and Tongtian advanced to Heavenly Sovereign! On the Myriad Races' side, Moon Heavenly Sovereign's physical body exploded, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, Desolate Heavenly Sovereign, and Yuan Saint were injured. The Divine Empress did not exert her full strength and can still fight!"

"How is that possible!"

"Unbelievable!"

The hall erupted into a heated discussion.

Yue Luo knew he was boosting others' morale while diminishing his own, but to give Hundred Battle a clearer understanding of the situation, he quickly added, "That's not all. In this battle, Yu Qing actually participated, but... even with her involvement, the situation couldn't be reversed! In the end, they had to summon the Brood Dragon Beast from the Gate of Hell to intimidate all sides! Tiangu realized the Myriad Races' foundation was insufficient and chose to retreat, allowing Su Yu to leave with his people!"

"Yu Qing?" Hundred Battle spoke softly, "Has she reached the level of a true master of the rules?"

"Yes!" Yue Luo nodded, speaking gravely, "I and Yue Xiao were prepared to continue our infiltration, but Su Yu had us fight against Thunderstorm and the Eight-Winged Tiger, persuading Yu Qing. The four Heavenly Sovereigns on both sides fought, and only after two died did it end... To preserve our strength, Yue Xiao and I chose to flee!"

"Alas!" Hundred Battle sighed lightly, quickly shaking his head, "Su Yu..."

In the hall, the expressions of the crowd were varied. Some changed color, while others said indifferently, "This is good! The meat rots in the pot. Su Yu leading people to decimate the Control King's lineage is a victory for the Human Race!"

Upon hearing this, many looked towards the speaker.

Some frowned, and among the crowd, Longbrow Sovereign said in a deep voice, "Blood Shadow, whose side are you on?"

Blood Shadow replied calmly, "On the side of the Human Race! Su Yu is the tenth generation Human Lord. He leads people to defeat the rebels and suppress the Myriad Races. Isn't that a good thing?"

Longbrow was furious, "He knows full well that Yue Luo and Thunderstorm are our people. Blood Shadow, he's deliberately targeting us. Can't you see that?"

Blood Shadow remained silent.

He understood!

Su Yu was indeed targeting Hundred Battle's faction; everyone knew that.

But... Su Yu's defeat of the rebels was exhilarating!

Six thousand years ago, to avoid heavy losses in battles against the Myriad Races and the Control King's lineage, Hundred Battle chose to avoid conflict. At that time, some were dissatisfied, but they all knew the situation couldn't be reversed.

Moreover, the losses were too severe and didn't meet expectations.

But now, Su Yu effortlessly slaughtered powerful enemies and annihilated multiple Heavenly Sovereigns. Isn't that something to be happy about?

Following Hundred Battle, they also had their beliefs.

The Human Race was their belief.

Whether it was the Human Ancestor, the Human Emperor, Su Yu, or Hundred Battle, they were all part of the Human Race, unlike the rebels of the Control King. They had never betrayed the Human Race, had they?

Blood Shadow thought to himself, ignoring Longbrow's questioning.

Perhaps!

Yes, for some, Su Yu's targeting of Hundred Battle's faction was quite apparent this time.

At this moment, there was considerable controversy.

Below, Marquis Jiang Hai said solemnly, "Your Majesty, Su Yu did it on purpose! After this battle, Su Yu's side has grown even stronger..."

Just as he said this, Yue Luo spoke softly, "On Su Yu's side, there are quite a few Heavenly Sovereigns now! March, Giant Axe, Fat Ball, Tongtian, including Fate, have all likely pledged allegiance to Su Yu! He himself possesses top-tier Heavenly Sovereign combat power. Previously, he teamed up with Thunderstorm and March to instantly kill Yue Hao."

"Thunderstorm?" Longbrow said quietly, "Thunderstorm has also allied with Su Yu? What does he mean by this?"

Some looked at Longbrow, raising their eyebrows slightly.

What was Longbrow trying to do?

Thunderstorm was the leader of the Giant Race, of course, the leader in the Upper Realm, while the Giant King was in the Lower Realm.

The alliance... must have been necessary, right?

Hundred Battle waved his hand slightly, interrupting Longbrow and not pursuing the topic further. He spoke softly, "I'm afraid that's not all; this may not be his full strength."

The crowd was shocked!

At this moment, on Hundred Battle's side, including Yue Luo, Yue Xiao, and Thunderstorm, there were only eight Heavenly Sovereign-level existences.

Of course, with Hundred Battle and Zhou Ji, there were more powerful figures.

But how long had Su Yu been accumulating strength?

Hundred Battle looked towards the sky, as if observing the River of Time. After a while, he continued, "Recently, that woman appeared... claiming to be a member of the Human Royal Family... likely from the Death Realm, which has also experienced some turmoil!"

Su Yu's side, he needed to pay attention to.

In the Upper Realm battle, Su Yu had led his people to rout the Control King's lineage, something he hadn't anticipated.

Not only did they not lose anyone, but they also had strong individuals advancing to Heavenly Sovereign.

"So now, on the Control King's side, there are only two masters of the rules left, along with Yue Zhan and Mo Tian?"

"Yes!" Yue Luo nodded.

"The Myriad Races have also suffered significant losses... Although no Heavenly Sovereigns died, from what you said, many were injured."

"Yes!"

"And you, because of Su Yu, have been exposed..."

Yue Luo nodded again, "Not only that, during the battle, he mentioned Zhou Ji's name, claiming he had reached the level of a master of the rules and was lurking deep in chaos. This was heard by the Myriad Races and Yu Qing, leading to some suspicions."

"Alas!" Hundred Battle sighed, quickly smiling, "Su Yu... a remarkable person!"

"Your Majesty!" Scholar Changqing quickly said, "Your Majesty, no matter how meticulous Su Yu's plans are, his strength hasn't reached a certain level. Now that masters of the rules have appeared, Su Yu cannot defy the heavens!"

He interrupted Hundred Battle's admiration. Now was not the time to marvel at Su Yu's strength; they couldn't further boost Su Yu's morale.

If this continued, it would cause some to waver.

Hundred Battle smiled, not too concerned. At this moment, he stood up and looked at everyone, "Su Yu's great victory in the Upper Realm is something I am pleased about! As for Yue Luo and Yue Xiao being exposed... let's just say, everyone has their own beliefs and ideas!"

"I don't know what Su Yu specifically thinks, but in my heart, I have no intention of opposing Su Yu... including this Human Realm. If he wants it, I can give it up!"

"Whether it's the Human Ancestor or the Human Emperor, they are all part of the Human Race!"

Hundred Battle's voice gradually grew louder, "But I'm afraid Su Yu doesn't understand my intentions. I mean no harm, but he may have the intent to kill me!"

These words were half true, half false!

Hundred Battle, after all, was a formidable leader.

At this moment, he didn't belittle Su Yu but spoke solemnly, "I am a direct disciple of the Human Ancestor, and so are all of you! The Human Ancestor paved the way for the Human Race, leading us to glory! I do not betray the Human Emperor, but the Human Emperor cannot defeat the masters of the rules of the Myriad Races, nor the future enemies. The Culture King and the others are trapped in the Heaven Gate, entangled by powerful enemies... even if they return, it will only bring disaster!"

"The Human Ancestor opened the path of the physical body, creating the world, and for the future of the Human Race, ventured alone into chaos, battling the powerful of chaos!"

"Bringing back the Human Ancestor is our only chance for victory!"

Hundred Battle spoke solemnly, "Su Yu is considering eliminating the current enemies, but he doesn't realize that the current enemies are just the tip of the iceberg! Whether it's the remnants of the Myriad Races or the Control King's lineage, they are just the tip of the iceberg!"

"He's not wrong, but his vision is too shallow!"

Hundred Battle said loudly, "He may think that once the Human Emperor returns, the Human Race will win! But is that possible?"

Hundred Battle shouted, "Impossible! Now, slaughtering all sides actually serves little purpose. Our ultimate goal is to bring back the Human Ancestor, to once again lead the Human Race to glory! As eras converge, chaos and the opening of the heavens, countless powerful beings are about to descend upon the Myriad Realms!"

"Some believe we are blocking Su Yu's path, hindering the Human Emperor's path. No, we are not!"

Hundred Battle declared, "The glory and strength of the Human Race were not achieved by relying on one person, but by everyone working together! But clearly, the Human Emperor cannot contend with all sides... otherwise, there wouldn't have been an ancient crisis! How can we hope that the Human Emperor's return will stop the powerful enemies from all sides?"

Everyone listened silently.

Hundred Battle continued, "The Gate of Hell has already cracked open, and Yu Qing and the others have emerged! This is also an opportunity, an early opportunity to bring back the Human Ancestor!"

Hundred Battle spoke solemnly, "However... the Control King's lineage cannot be destroyed!"

Upon hearing this, some were shocked, while others remained silent, clearly aware of this.

Hundred Battle spoke gravely, "If they are destroyed, how can we continue to bring people out, to widen the crack in the Gate of Hell? Now, it can only accommodate a few masters of the rules, and it requires a great cost! Back then, it wasn't that we couldn't fight, couldn't kill, but the Control King's lineage couldn't be easily touched!"

"Only they can guide the powerful beings within to return, to open the Gates of Hell ahead of time, allowing the Human Ancestor to seize the initiative!"

"The return of the Human Ancestor, reversing the tide, saving the Human Emperor and others, slaying the formidable enemies of the myriad races, and defeating the rulers of the myriad races' laws—this is our only hope!"

Hundred Battle shouted passionately, "For this, we have paid a great price! For this, we have borne the burden of infamy!"

"Betrayal? That woman said we betrayed... Perhaps our actions did not align with the Human Emperor's intentions, but in essence, it was for the sake of the human race! Is the Human Emperor more important, or is the human race more important?"

The crowd fell silent, their expressions heavy.

At this moment, someone suddenly spoke. It was Marquis Zhen Nan, his gaze complicated as he said, "Your Majesty, are you saying that back then, we deliberately allowed the Control King's lineage to grow stronger?"

Hundred Battle replied solemnly, "Not deliberately! First, the opponent was not weak. If we had gone all out, we would have suffered heavy losses, and the myriad races might have taken advantage of us! Second, only when their people grew stronger could they hope to guide the rulers of the laws out, widening the rift and allowing the Human Ancestor to return early! Third, I also made some arrangements. Whether it's Yue Luo or Yue Xiao, they are our trump cards!"

Marquis Zhen Nan remained silent for a while, his expression complex and conflicted, but he still spoke, "Then... Bingku and the others... they still died in battle!"

Hundred Battle fell silent.

Marquis Zhen Nan lowered his head, "They truly died! If... if my guess is correct, Bingku and the others probably knew about Your Majesty's plan but disagreed with it, right?"

Before Hundred Battle could respond, Changqing frowned slightly and said softly, "Zhen Nan, it's not as you think! His Majesty was sincere back then, and Bingku and the others knew His Majesty's intentions! But Bingku and his group's idea was to first break the blockade of the myriad races and the Control King's lineage, then seek to break the seal, give birth to a few rulers of the laws, and go upstream in the River of Time to rescue His Majesty the Human Emperor..."

Changqing said bitterly, "Bingku's idea wasn't wrong, but would a few more rulers of the laws really be able to save His Majesty and the others? That's not certain! Moreover, in the end, we might not even win!"

"His Majesty explained the pros and cons to Bingku and the others. It was Bingku, Danyu, and the others who chose to fight to the death with the myriad races. His Majesty promised that even if they died in battle, their willpower would escape, and he would save them... It was they themselves who, at the last moment, even self-destructed their willpower!"

Changqing sighed, "I can understand their choice. They were the secret guards of His Majesty the Human Emperor, and their hearts were with His Majesty! But from the perspective of the entire human race, His Majesty's choice... was wiser, wasn't it?"

Marquis Zhen Nan's expression grew more complex, "So, the Torchbearer lineage was almost wiped out, and it was actually their own choice?"

"Yes."

Marquis Zhen Nan said in a low voice, "Then... may I ask one more question? Now, if Su Yu's side disagrees with Your Majesty's philosophy and insists on exterminating Yu Qing and others, temporarily sealing the Gates of Hell, and going upstream to rescue His Majesty the Human Emperor, what choice will Your Majesty make?"

He looked up at Hundred Battle, his expression extremely complicated, "Your Majesty! Will there be another Torchbearer incident? Would Your Majesty stop Su Yu and his group?"

Hundred Battle was silent for a moment before slowly saying, "I will have someone explain the pros and cons to Su Yu. The Control King's lineage cannot be completely exterminated now! The appearance of two rulers of the laws has already caused a rift in the portal. As long as we continue to apply pressure, they can keep guiding the rulers of the laws to appear, further expanding the rift! When the time is right, we can find a way to guide the Human Ancestor back!"

Marquis Zhen Nan said in a low voice, "Then... what if we can't guide them? Is the Human Ancestor definitely within the Gates of Hell?"

Hundred Battle nodded, "Definitely there! And we can definitely guide them!"

"Then what about the Control King? If the Human Ancestor is guided, can the Control King come out? If the Control King comes out, what about the powerful beings of the Chaos Ancient Clan?"

Marquis Zhen Nan continued to ask, "Can the Human Ancestor suppress them?"

"He can!"

Hundred Battle continued, "On this point, you must believe in the strength of the Human Ancestor!"

Marquis Zhen Nan was silent for a while, then said, "So... we're pinning all our hopes on the strength of the Human Ancestor? Is the source of this information reliable? Your Majesty, why not place hope in yourself?"

Hundred Battle was silent for a moment before continuing, "Because... our enemies are more terrifying than you imagine! They are the strongest of an era! They have lived for countless years. Even if I place hope in myself, in six thousand years, can I become the next Four Extremes Human King? Can I become the next Human Emperor? I... don't hold much hope. It's not that I've given up on myself... but I understand that it's very difficult for me to catch up with them and become the next Human Emperor, the next Culture King!"

Is this the truth?

Naturally, it is!

Hundred Battle is very strong, but does he have hope of becoming the next Four Extremes Human King, the next Human Emperor?

Not necessarily!

So, the hope lies with the Human Ancestor.

Marquis Zhen Nan's expression grew more complex, "So... what we're pursuing is for the Human Ancestor to be able to do everything, to save everything! Your Majesty, is that what you mean?"

"Yes."

"If Su Yu disrupts Your Majesty's plan, will Your Majesty... also deal with him?"

Hundred Battle remained silent.

Changmei rebuked, "Zhen Nan, are you questioning His Majesty? Do you think that even if Su Yu's side gives birth to a few rulers of the laws, they can save the human race?"

Marquis Zhen Nan shook his head, "I didn't say that, nor did I mean that. I just think... compared to Your Majesty, Su Yu... perhaps he believes in himself more!"

His expression was extremely complex, "He believes he can resolve all crises, he believes he can rescue others, rather than being rescued by others! He is different from Your Majesty, he is blindly confident..."

Is it really blind?

Marquis Zhen Nan didn't know!

He only knew that Su Yu once said he would attack the Upper Realm, and it seemed he had done it in less than a year!

The biggest difference between Su Yu and Hundred Battle at this moment is that Hundred Battle places hope in the Human Ancestor, while Su Yu places hope only in himself!

Which is better?

Su Yu's blind confidence, this feeling of a young man not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth, those who don't know him might scoff at first glance!

Do you think you're stronger than the Human Emperor?

Do you think you can surpass the Human Ancestor?

Or do you think you can become an emperor in three years, no, one year!

Who would believe that?

But Marquis Zhen Nan knew, some people believed, everyone around Su Yu believed, if they didn't, they wouldn't follow him to the death!

Just like Hundred Battle's side, some people believed, if they didn't, there wouldn't have been so many followers back then.

In the past, Marquis Zhen Nan would have scoffed at Su Yu's choice!

A young man in his twenties, truly not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth, do you know how strong the Four Extremes Human King is? Do you know how strong the Human Emperor is?

But now... he didn't think so.

He only fought alongside Su Yu once, during the rescue of Hundred Battle, and everything else was hearsay, all legends, but he had learned everything about Su Yu in the Human Realm, he had witnessed with his own eyes the strong of the Human Realm retreating with Su Yu, and Su Yu's arrogant words.

I will be back soon!

In less than two months.

He was coming back soon!

Marquis Zhen Nan had a premonition that Su Yu was coming back soon.

With Su Yu's character, there would definitely be a conflict with Hundred Battle, definitely!

This was Marquis Zhen Nan's firm belief!

Not only him, but at this moment, those familiar with Su Yu, whether it was Marquis Yun Shui or Shadow, all felt a bit strange. Su Yu... would definitely have a conflict with Hundred Battle, this was an absolute difference in philosophy!

Hundred Battle would not allow Su Yu to destroy the Control King's lineage now!

And Su Yu... would definitely go to kill!

Others who hadn't interacted with Su Yu didn't understand, but these three knew what kind of person Su Yu was, even if they hadn't interacted for long, they knew Su Yu would definitely not listen to Hundred Battle.

No matter how eloquent Hundred Battle was, Su Yu wouldn't listen, he would only follow his own ideas, and if Hundred Battle blocked him... he would kill Hundred Battle too!

Marquis Zhen Nan struggled, conflicted, and finally spoke, "Your Majesty, if Su Yu insists on exterminating the Control King's lineage... can we join forces with Su Yu? Killing Yu Qing and the others, without them, can the Gates of Hell really not be opened?"

"You don't understand!"

Hundred Battle frowned slightly, "Yu Qing was guided out by the Control King's lineage using bloodline and the power of the Great Dao, and Yu Qing would definitely carry some positioning items to provide those ancient beasts with a position to lock onto the myriad realms, thus opening the Gates of Hell! Killing Yu Qing would most likely result in the positioning items shattering, so Yu Qing... cannot be killed! Killing Yu Qing would end the opening of the Gates of Hell, and who knows when it would open again, perhaps it would open with everyone else... then there would be no advantage at all!"

On this day, Hundred Battle explained a lot.

The invisible pressure made him explain to these subordinates why he was doing this.

Before this, many of Hundred Battle's thoughts were actually unfathomable.

But at this moment, he told everyone not to waver.

Because of Su Yu!

At this point, Hundred Battle knew he might have a conflict with Su Yu!

This conflict wasn't because of the human race, wasn't because of the Human Realm, wasn't because of status, but... the two sides had completely different philosophies, even irreconcilable.

Marquis Zhen Nan asked again, "Then... what if we can completely preserve the positioning items?"

Hundred Battle frowned slightly, "If you were the ancient beasts behind the door, and you saw Su Yu and the others kill Yu Qing and Po Long, would you continue to come out to be killed one by one? They cannot come out together, only one by one to expand the rift in the Gates of Hell! If you were them, would you be foolish enough to continue seeking death knowing that coming out means death?"

So, even if Su Yu completely preserved the chaotic will, it wouldn't be very useful.

Some of the beings behind the door could sense it.

You’ve already killed two rulers of laws. Do you expect us to line up for you to kill us one by one?

“So, the only solution is to wait for Yu Qing to bring in a few more rulers of laws, widen the gap, and then we strike. We can’t kill too many at once. For example, if he has five rulers of laws, we kill one or two, let them continue to send reinforcements, and keep them on the hook instead of wiping them out all at once!”

Hundred Battle spoke in a deep voice, “Don’t give them the chance to grow stronger, but also don’t annihilate them directly. Do you understand?”

Marquis Zhen Nan thought for a moment and nodded, “Then… may I serve as an envoy to Su Yu’s side? To explain the pros and cons to him. I believe there’s still a possibility of forming an alliance! Whether it’s His Majesty or Su Yu, both aim for the strength of the Human Race. We share the same goal. If we can negotiate, wouldn’t that be better?”

He wanted to be the envoy to Su Yu’s side!

Upon hearing this, many people looked at him with different expressions.

Hundred Battle pondered for a while and nodded, “Alright, I also hope you can persuade Su Yu, rather than acting recklessly!”

“Thank you, Your Majesty!”

Just as he finished speaking, Chang Mei frowned and said, “Your Majesty, I don’t think Marquis Zhen Nan should go alone. Perhaps someone should accompany him?”

Marquis Zhen Nan slightly furrowed his brows, “What do you mean, Marquis Chang Mei?”

Chang Mei replied indifferently, “I mean no harm, just concerned about Marquis Zhen Nan’s safety!”

Marquis Zhen Nan frowned, “Su Yu’s side is currently in the Death Realm. If I go, he might let me in. But if accompanied, he might not allow us entry!”

“Marquis Zhen Nan, you seem to have quite the influence!”

Chang Mei said coldly, “Su Yu would actually let you in. Does that mean you have a good relationship with him?”

Marquis Zhen Nan frowned, “Not really, but before Su Yu left, he met me once and entrusted me to take care of the Human Realm. We do have some connection! If someone must accompany me… let Xia Hu You come along!”

Marquis Zhen Nan understood Su Yu well. If others accompanied him, Su Yu might not allow them entry. If anything went wrong, Su Yu would likely… kill them!

Yes!

He firmly believed that.

If an envoy were killed, it would be impossible to reconcile, so he didn’t want others to accompany him. Xia Hu You and the others were fine.

As he was thinking, someone suddenly whispered, “Doesn’t the Marquis have a lot of death energy? Why not directly open the Death Realm and negotiate face-to-face with Su Yu? Wouldn’t that be better?”

Upon hearing this, Marquis Zhen Nan’s face changed dramatically!

He suddenly looked at the speaker, his face turning ashen, and gritted his teeth, “Wen Qi!”

Wen Qi looked apologetic, “Marquis, you and I are both subjects of His Majesty. Now that His Majesty has a problem, shouldn’t we help him solve it better…”

Marquis Zhen Nan’s face was ashen, “You… are courting death, do you know that?”

Wen Qi’s heart trembled slightly, but he quickly said in a low voice, “Marquis, are you referring to Su Yu?”

Marquis Zhen Nan gritted his teeth, “What do you think?”

Wen Qi knew a bit about the death energy. After all, he was a strategist under Marquis Zhen Nan. Although the Marquis hadn’t mentioned it, Wen Qi knew him too well. They had been together for a long time, and even a slight hint could lead Wen Qi to guess.

Wen Qi, being a strategist, was naturally intelligent.

At this moment, Wen Qi said softly, “I am a subject of His Majesty, not of Su Yu! Marquis… I know your thoughts. Actually, I’m also afraid, yes, I’m afraid of Su Yu, afraid he’ll kill me…”

Wen Qi self-mockingly said, “But having eaten the lord’s salary, one must be loyal to the lord! Marquis, we… are subjects of Hundred Battle His Majesty! Not subjects of Su Yu, the Human Lord!”

Was he wrong?

He was a subject of Hundred Battle, not of Su Yu. Marquis Zhen Nan was hiding a big secret, and this was a matter of great importance. He had considered it, weighed it, and finally chose to speak out.

We can actually enter the Death Realm directly!

Marquis Zhen Nan had enough death energy to open the passage to the Death Realm and enter directly.

Su Yu’s previous intimidation had led the myriad races to destroy their death energy. The ancient cities had disappeared, and now, there was almost no death energy in the Myriad Realms.

However, Marquis Zhen Nan could produce enough death energy to open the passage.

At this moment, many people looked at Marquis Zhen Nan, and Chang Mei said in a deep voice, “Zhen Nan, do you have a large amount of death energy?”

Marquis Zhen Nan said heavily, “So what if I do? So what if I don’t? Are we going to open the passage and fight Su Yu’s side directly? They’ve already retreated to the Death Realm. Do we have to fight our way in? Let’s take the proper path as envoys!”

Opening the passage directly would likely lead to a major battle.

There was a ninety percent chance of that!

Chang Mei said coldly, “Whether you have it or not, it’s up to His Majesty to decide. Zhen Nan, have you changed your mind?”

Marquis Zhen Nan gritted his teeth, “Whether I have ulterior motives, His Majesty will decide, not you! Chang Mei, you’ve stepped into the realm of Heavenly Sovereign, but what does that represent? For six thousand years, you’ve been healing and comprehending the Great Dao, while we’ve been struggling in the Upper Realm, delaying the myriad races, gathering their information… How many of those who stayed behind survived? It’s not your place to question me!”

His aura erupted, revealing that he was also at the level of a Heavenly King!

He was already close to a Heavenly King, and after Hundred Battle’s return, he had restored his physical body, allowing him to step into the Heavenly King level!

At this moment, Marquis Zhen Nan angrily said, “Chang Mei, stop currying favor with His Majesty! You’re a treacherous minister, misleading His Majesty! You keep urging His Majesty to oppose Su Yu’s side. Do you know Su Yu’s side’s strength? Do you dare to boast that they can be wiped out at any time? Do you know how many Human Race experts will die if a conflict breaks out because of your flattery? Do you want to make friends grieve and enemies rejoice? He is the Human Lord, and His Majesty is also the Human Lord. Although they are not from the same era or period, they are both Human Lords with the same goal for the Human Race. Why do you keep flattering and slandering?”

Chang Mei’s face was icy, “Are you talking about me?”

“Yes, you!”

Marquis Zhen Nan rebuked, “His Majesty hasn’t spoken yet, and you’re making decisions for him? I’m going to Su Yu as an envoy for the Human Race, for the people, and the heavens can testify. You insist on interfering, and your intentions are punishable!”

At this moment, Hundred Battle said in a deep voice, “Enough, everyone, be quiet!”

He interrupted the discussion, his voice extremely authoritative, “Zhen Nan… since you’re confident, go find Su Yu and tell him I have no intention of being his enemy! Whether it’s giving up the Human Realm or leaving the Lower Realm, we can negotiate! However, the lineage of the Control King cannot be exterminated for now! This is the core strategy. Whether Su Yu kills the myriad races or exterminates the undead, he cannot completely annihilate the Control King’s lineage for now!”

“Your Majesty is wise!”

Marquis Zhen Nan was delighted. Fortunately, His Majesty didn’t listen to Chang Mei, the treacherous minister.

As for negotiations, it’s better to talk than not to talk. If we don’t talk, it means a hundred percent chance of war. If we talk, there’s at least a chance.

Maybe… we can persuade Su Yu?

Or find a compromise that both sides can accept!

Hundred Battle nodded slightly, saying no more.

Let’s talk!

As for whether it will work, we’ll see.

Moreover, if we really want to go to the Death Realm, we don’t necessarily need death energy, and there’s no need to chill the hearts of old ministers like Zhen Nan, so he didn’t mention the death energy at all!

…

At this moment, Su Yu was unaware of all this.

He was currently searching for Mo Tianzun and finally blocked him in the Chaos Mountain area. When Mo Tianzun saw him, his face changed dramatically, and he turned to flee!

Unlucky!

Why is Su Yu still wandering around here?

Isn’t he afraid that Yu Qing and Yue Zhan will appear and join forces to kill him?

This guy is too crazy!

“Give me the Councilor Tokens!”

Su Yu’s voice was lazy, “Give them to me, and I won’t chase you. If not… I’ll chase you from morning till night. If you can escape, you’re impressive!”

Buzz!

Seven Councilor Tokens shot over.

The speed was unparalleled.

Su Yu was stunned, “You’re not going to struggle a bit?”

Mo Tianzun didn’t even bother to speak, quickly fleeing.

Struggle for what?

Struggle to see if I’ll die?

The Demon Race needs him.

He can’t die!

If he dies, the Demon Race won’t even have a Heavenly Sovereign, which would be a huge problem.

Su Yu found it boring!

Coward!

Really cowardly!

Killing you isn’t that simple.

Su Yu still said, “If I kill you, Yu Qing and the others will most likely chase me. What are you afraid of? I’m just scaring you!”

Mo Tianzun ignored him, running, continuing to run!

Taking advantage of Su Yu not chasing, he ran even faster, even using blood-burning techniques.

Run, the farther away from this demon, the better.

The demeanor of the strong who chased Su Yu in the Dao Source Land was completely gone.

Su Yu cursed, why run so fast.

I haven’t even visited my old friend yet.

“Hey, how’s my old friend Mo Duona? By the way, are you related by blood? Mo Duona is my brother, you better treat him well. He’s the top of the Heaven List, and I didn’t even kill him. Don’t you dare kill him… and…”

Mo Tianzun had long since run far away.

Su Yu sighed helplessly.

Running really fast.

Seeing the other party running towards Yu Qing’s direction, Su Yu shrugged, forget it, I won’t provoke Yu Qing and the others now, it’s not the right time.

“Martial Emperor, I’m here to save you!”

Su Yu sighed, I’m really a good person.

Upper Realm, Lower Realm, I’m going to completely open the passage!

Of course, that’s not the key. The key is, soon, the Myriad Realms will have two more rulers of laws.

“Martial Emperor, Undead Emperor, Yu Qing, Po Long Beast, Hundred Battle, Zhou Ji… are there more?”

Su Yu calculated for a while, quite a few.

From now on, there will be more strong people above me.

“Poor me… I can only stand on the second tier with Yue Zhan, the Divine Empress, Chaos Dragon, and Fat Ball!”

Su Yu laughed, his smile radiant.

I’m so pitiful!

As for my actual strength… how would I know?

Su Yu only knew that with each expansion of the heavens, the integration of the Great Dao, his comprehension grew stronger. In his own world, he wasn’t afraid of these people now, but outside, it was hard to say.

“Forget it, I’ll continue being my Heavenly Sovereign!”

Su Yu didn’t even know his own realm, being an opener of the heavens, what realm could there be?

Being able to kill is a good realm.

"Perhaps, before the Martial Emperor is unsealed, I should go and give him another beating. Otherwise, once he's free, I won't have the chance..." With this thought in mind, Su Yu swiftly flew towards the depths of chaos.

As for the likes of Yu Qing and the others, he ignored them. These people wouldn't dare to come out and kill him. If he ventured too far and got ambushed again, that would be troublesome.

"The Sin Clan must be eradicated as soon as possible. Otherwise, if they keep summoning the Lords of Rules, who can bear it?" Su Yu muttered to himself as he flew away. They must be killed! Not only killed, but after killing them, he needed to find a way to seal the Gate of Hell. He didn't have the time to linger in the Myriad Realms. He needed to quickly assist the Human Emperor and the others, to bring them back and fight against the Heaven Gate and the Gate of Hell together.

"The fear is that if I leave, and the Myriad Realms aren't pacified, someone might open the Gate of Hell again. That would be a real problem. So even if I go upstream, I must ensure the Myriad Realms are pacified first!"

Time waits for no one! At this moment, Su Yu's mind was filled with countless thoughts. As for leaving the lineage of the Control King, killing one and replacing them with another Lord of Rules, it seemed satisfying and even beneficial. But Su Yu worried that repeated summoning might lead to the premature opening of the Gate of Hell.

He had no interest in battling a horde of Chaos Ancient Beasts, nor in facing the Control King alone. These troublesome matters should be left to the Human Emperor and his people!

Even though Su Yu didn't know the purpose of the Hundred Battle lineage, he had some suspicions. The Hundred Battle had been planting spies within the Control King's lineage. Su Yu wondered if their target was inside the Gate of Hell. Could it be that the Human Ancestor was in there?

Who cares! I don't even know the Human Ancestor! Su Yu didn't take it too seriously. Whether it was the Human Ancestor or the Human Emperor, the ones who could help him were the good ancestors. Otherwise, they were unreliable.

Relying on others is not as good as relying on oneself. Seeking out the Human Emperor was because this mess was left by him.
