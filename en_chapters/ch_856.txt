Chapter 856: Further Strengthening (Please Subscribe)

Within the Myriad Realms.

Su Yu displayed a hint of a smile—Culture King had succeeded! He could feel it! Although he hadn't seen Culture King, on this day, the two sensed each other across the void. Su Yu grinned, a good thing indeed. Culture King had obtained the boots, borrowing the power of heaven and earth. Even if he couldn't match that terrifying adversary, at least he had some assurance!

"Human Emperor, Culture King..."

Su Yu murmured, feeling that life was still quite good. With the Human Emperor holding the front line and Culture King at the Heaven Gate, it was a pity that there weren't many arrangements for the Earth Gate and Human Gate. Otherwise, this era would be enough to suppress the formidable enemies of the Myriad Realms!

And Culture King and the others hadn't disappointed Su Yu. These old fellows had made quite a few arrangements. Apart from the Human Gate, the other two gates had plans, which allowed Su Yu to feel much more at ease.

Since his return, Su Yu hadn't rested. At this moment, he finally caught a breath. Previously, he hadn't even had the time to breathe. Perhaps it was an exaggeration, but that sense of urgency had kept Su Yu from stopping for even a moment.

Now, with Culture King connecting to his own world, Su Yu felt much more at ease. The Human Emperor was stationed at the front, and there were no major issues. The myriad races didn't dare to come over. The Myriad Realms were peaceful, and amidst the busyness, Su Yu's mood improved.

Of course, Gui's roars served as a seasoning!

"Su Yu, are you scheming against me?"

From within the Heaven Gate, Gui roared, "Why could Culture King discover me?"

What had Su Yu done to the boots?

At this moment, Gui was very worried, concerned that Culture King might suddenly attack. Had he already discovered Gui's physical location? Had he found Su Yu's Heaven Gate projection?

Gui roared angrily, "Su Yu, don't go too far. If you push me, I'll go all out!"

He felt a crisis looming!

At this moment, he was very worried about his fate. Culture King's move had indeed frightened him.

Although Su Yu didn't know the specifics, he could generally sense Gui's fear and couldn't help but laugh. Was Gui scared by Culture King?

How had Culture King frightened him?

Poor Gui, not very brave.

Not very brave, yet full of ideas. If he were truly scared to death, he should have fled by now instead of cursing here.

Indeed, it's not scary to be cowardly; what's scary is being cowardly and greedy!

Gui was a typical example.

He greedily thought of descending upon the Myriad Realms, yet he was very afraid of Culture King finding him. Su Yu didn't know if it was because of his age that Gui feared death yet remained greedy. But to Su Yu, he was a typical case of not surviving past the next year!

"If all the old-timers were like Gui, then there wouldn't be much to worry about!"

Su Yu chuckled, treating Gui as non-existent, not bothering to pay attention.

Go ahead and curse!

Boom!

He closed the Heaven Gate slightly, making Gui's voice much quieter. He didn't close it completely, mainly leaving a bit open for Culture King to draw upon the power of heaven and earth.

Gui grew even more anxious.

But at this moment, he had no way to deal with Su Yu.

Helpless, Gui decided to go all out!

Fine, you ignore me, right?

You're so arrogant, Su Yu, don't blame me for being rude. I still have a clone in the Myriad Realms!

At this moment, he had received a lot of information.

He also knew about Su Yu's strength. This guy had quite a solid foundation, no wonder he wasn't afraid of me. Under his command, there were actually nine rulers of laws, plus Su Yu himself, making it a total of ten!

No wonder this guy was so arrogant, even daring to fight that second-tier peak.

Because in the Myriad Realms, Su Yu had the most people and the strongest forces. That second-tier peak had attacked several times, only to be repelled by Su Yu's side, even nearly falling into Su Yu's hands.

Gui snorted coldly in his heart, that was a second-tier, but I am first-tier!

Moreover, I can call for reinforcements!

Didn't Su Yu agree to let anyone come?

Fine!

Then I'll call for reinforcements and see how I deal with you!

...

Su Yu had no interest in dealing with Gui.

At this time, Su Yu arrived within his world.

Previously, with the integration of the Great Dao, the world expanded, and at this moment, someone had broken through, not just one.

The first to break through was Empyrean Cloud.

Empyrean Cloud had previously cultivated the Sword Dao, which Grandstar had ceded to her. Taking advantage of the world's upheaval, she finally mastered the Sword Dao and stepped into the realm of a ruler of laws.

Empyrean Cloud was the first, followed by Marquis Huoyun!

This ancient general, a subordinate of King Yue, had his luck turn this time. Su Yu had just strengthened the Dao of Burning. Marquis Huoyun's previous cultivation path differed slightly from the Burning Dao, and with Heavenly Fire having seized the opportunity last time, he hadn't been able to break through.

This time, however, fortune favored him, and Marquis Huoyun broke through!

On the day Su Yu found six strong individuals in the Upper Realm, Shadow and Yun Shui were slain by Su Yu, Yingwu and Zhennan had already broken through, and now, with Marquis Huoyun breaking through again, only Marquis Dingjun remained, looking at Su Yu with a face full of grievance, not knowing what to say.

Of those who survived, he was the only one who hadn't broken through!

He walked the path of the Long Halberd, similar to the Spear Dao, but Marquis Dingjun's luck wasn't good, and he just couldn't break through, still stuck at the Heavenly King realm.

Within the Human Lord Seal.

A small world, a small palace stood.

Empyrean Cloud, Tea Plant, Great Zhou King, Marquis Huoyun, Heaven Monitoring Marquis, Marquis Tongtian, Book Spirit—except for Marquis Tongtian, who had returned with Su Yu, the others were stationed in the Myriad Realms.

In other words, at this moment, Su Yu could still mobilize six rulers of laws. Including himself, he had a total of 42 rulers of laws!

Of course, counting Xingyue, it was actually 43.

Moreover, Great Zhou King was currently second-tier, and Book Spirit, having left Culture King's world, was also second-tier, both nearly reaching first-tier.

Heaven Monitoring Marquis, despite Su Yu having integrated a lot of fortune into the Human Emperor's world, had a strong world and abundant fortune. With subordinates continuing to break through, having defeated the myriad races and killed many strong individuals, Heaven Monitoring Marquis had vaguely reached second-tier as well!

The stationed strong individuals didn't seem weak at all!

However, at this moment, Su Yu suddenly sighed, "Those who haven't broken through before... it will be even harder in the future!"

As his world continued to expand and the Great Dao was strengthened!

Those who had already broken through or seized the opportunity to break through benefited. After all, they had already mastered the Great Dao. Su Yu could fill the Great Dao, and at most, they would continue to comprehend it later, which didn't really affect anything.

However... for those who hadn't broken through, as the Great Dao strengthened, it would become more difficult to break through!

When Su Yu's world grew even stronger, those who wanted to break through later might find it as difficult as stepping into the realm of a ruler of laws within the River of Time. Such difficulty was significant.

In the past ten thousand years, those who truly stepped into this level were actually those Heavenly Venerables, considered rulers of laws, totaling only about twenty or thirty, averaging one every three to four hundred years.

A newly opened world actually presented a great opportunity!

The saying "when one person attains the Dao, even their chickens and dogs ascend to heaven" wasn't empty talk. The emergence of so many strong individuals under Su Yu's command was related to the opening of his new world.

Among the crowd, some were disheartened!

Marquis Dingjun was very disheartened!

Grandstar, who had ceded his path, was also silent, feeling a bit lost but said nothing.

Great Xia King had already left, recently taking those dark guards somewhere unknown, so he didn't have the chance to be disheartened. Others, more or less, felt a bit lost.

They had missed opportunity after opportunity!

Time and again!

One old friend after another stepped into that level, while they repeatedly missed their chances.

When Su Yu's side reached over 40 rulers of laws, it was already somewhat overloaded. Those who could break through had almost all done so.

At this moment, Su Yu was silent for a while, looking at a few people.

"Great Han King, Great Tang King, Great Song King, Grandstar, Shan Qi..."

Su Yu called out one by one, and the crowd looked at him.

Su Yu continued, "April, May, Devour Space, Tian Ce..."

"You all still have a chance!"

The crowd looked at Su Yu, who spoke softly, "Everyone sees that village outside, right? The previous Dao Source Land! That's the Human Emperor's world. In the Human Emperor's world, there aren't many choices for the Great Dao, but some common Great Daos are available... Currently, there are quite a few strong individuals on the Human Emperor's side, but most are rulers of laws. My idea is simple... Here, after all, is my territory. If the Human Emperor comes to open the world... it's also a great opportunity for you. Go to the Human Emperor's world to open your path!"

Upon hearing this, the crowd's expressions changed.

Leaving Su Yu's world to join the Human Emperor's world.

This was an opportunity!

A great opportunity!

The Human Emperor's world didn't have many Great Daos, and there were quite a few Heavenly Venerables, Heavenly Kings, and some Daofuse existences, as well as many rulers of laws. If they occupied the Great Dao, they could quickly divide the Human Emperor's world.

However, Su Yu could help them secure some spots.

Su Yu spoke softly, "You can't find a suitable path here, like Tian Ce, your Fate Clan's path was taken by those two guys, and Devour Space too, your partner Lie Kong Marquis cultivated the Space Dao, making it difficult for you! April and May are the same... Similar Great Daos exist here, but they may not completely suit you!"

"So, try the Human Emperor's side!"

Upon hearing this, Grandstar felt a bit melancholic and spoke softly, "Is Your Majesty asking us to join the Human Emperor's ranks? Although Your Majesty and the Human Emperor are both emperors, in the past, we also served the Human Emperor... But the Human Emperor... after all, is the emperor of the human race... Your Majesty... if we go to the Human Emperor's world..."

He still felt melancholic and struggled.

There were many opportunities on Su Yu's side, but unfortunately, they hadn't seized them!

Now, Su Yu was looking for a new home for their future, for their own good, but for someone like Grandstar, who had supported Su Yu early on, it was still a bit difficult.

Su Yu smiled, "We're all one family. In the grand scheme of things, the Human Emperor and I have no opposition. Of course, you can also think of it as... planting a nail in the Human Emperor's world!"

Su Yu chuckled, "The Human Emperor wants to wrest power from me, so I need to plant some of my people over there! When it comes to the power of laws, I'm reluctant to let go. So, why not take this opportunity to send everyone over? They can take a bite out of his resources, seize a position, and become rulers of laws! If he merges with the Heaven and Earth Spirit, the world will expand and transform rapidly. If he further integrates with the Human Emperor's Great Dao... he could soon advance to the first tier!"

"Two opportunities!" Su Yu laughed. "This is a rare chance. For those of you who haven't broken through, these two opportunities almost guarantee a breakthrough. After all, your understanding of the Great Dao isn't that far off!"

The opportunity was indeed significant, though the choices within the Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth Great Dao were limited. The Culture King's realm was also an option, but since the Culture King wasn't present, and it was best not to expose his realm now, the Human Emperor's realm was more suitable. Moreover, this was a process of mutual assistance. The Human Emperor's realm was currently weak, providing many opportunities for enhancement. Those who merged with his realm would also have numerous opportunities.

Su Yu smiled again, "If I weren't worried about the limited number of Great Daos in the Human Emperor's realm and the fierce competition, I would have sent everyone in... But for now, the Human Emperor is focused on strengthening his combat power, so at the very least, one must be at the Daofuse level to have a chance!"

"There are still some ancient marquises under the Human Emperor who haven't broken through yet! Along with those rulers of laws, there are about a hundred of them! His Great Dao isn't numerous..."

Below, the Great Zhou King coughed lightly, indicating that it was enough. Su Yu had mentioned several times that the Human Emperor's Great Dao was limited. Everyone understood that Su Yu's Great Dao was abundant, so there was no need to boast further.

Su Yu laughed heartily, "However, having fewer Daos has its advantages. The Human Emperor is different from me. His Heaven and Earth is genuinely profound in its understanding of the Great Dao. I'm different; I rely on everyone's strength to comprehend the Great Dao and the Time Sage's power to open up the Heaven and Earth Great Dao... Essentially, I've benefited from everyone and the Time Sage. In terms of pure understanding of the Great Dao, I'm not as good as the Human Emperor!"

He continued with a smile, "Among my thousands of Daos, those that have reached the realm of rulers of laws are actually not many. But the Human Emperor, because he has fewer Daos, has comprehended them himself, and thus, they are more numerous!"

Su Yu was in a state of having many but not being proficient, while the Human Emperor was the opposite—few but proficient. Which of these two realms had greater potential? Clearly, it was Su Yu's! But potential was just potential. The Human Emperor's Daos were stronger! When one of the Human Emperor's Daos was stronger than ten of Su Yu's, naturally, Su Yu couldn't compete with the Human Emperor. It all depended on the individual.

Everyone listened intently as Su Yu continued, "If you are willing, I will speak to the Human Emperor. I think he would be embarrassed to refuse me!"

Su Yu smiled, "Under normal circumstances, how could someone else occupy the Great Dao within one's Heaven and Earth? But now, the Human Emperor owes me a favor... Even if I send you all to occupy some of the rulers of laws' Daos, he wouldn't have the face to refuse! This opportunity comes only once, so there's no need to worry too much or overthink!"

Everyone exchanged glances, some feeling tempted. On Su Yu's side, the Great Dao would only grow stronger, making it increasingly difficult to advance. Missing the initial opportunity was like missing a venture capital investment; if you didn't enter early, it would be hard to profit later.

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun spoke up, sounding somewhat aggrieved, "Your Majesty, does this make me two-faced? I was first with the Human Emperor, then pledged to Your Majesty, and now I'm turning back to the Human Emperor..."

Su Yu laughed, "Think whatever you want. Did I stop you from breaking through? You missed the chance yourself, and now you want to go!"

Marquis Dingjun felt quite aggrieved. He wanted to say, "I walk the path of the spear!" But the Great Qin King had already taken that path!

Among the Iron Devourer Race, April and May exchanged glances, feeling tempted. They had pledged allegiance to Su Yu early on, and many of their strong members had advanced. March, Giant Bamboo, and September had all become rulers of laws, leaving them without opportunities. The available Daos were already occupied by others, and the remaining ones didn't suit them.

At this moment, April grinned, "Your Majesty, does this mean we're splitting the family?"

He grinned again, "In the future, March will lead one branch, and we'll lead another branch of the Iron Devourer Race?"

Su Yu laughed, "What about January?"

Truth be told, the Iron Devourer Race had many strong members. There were also July, August, and Full Moon, who were quite powerful. August was relatively weaker but not too weak. This race, from January to September, only lacked February and June, which were supplemented by Marquis Giant Bamboo and Full Moon, making a total of nine top-tier experts.

Upon hearing Su Yu's words, April grinned widely. January? Who cares! March is the father, so I'll let him be. January is the great-grandfather, so I won't bother with him!

At this time, the Great Zhou King also spoke, "This is indeed a rare opportunity. How many openers have there been since ancient times? From the ancient era to now, as far as I know, there are only the Human Emperor and Emperor Yu! Now, since everyone hasn't broken through... the Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth is also very strong. The foundation of the Human Emperor is intact, and soon, it will become strong again... At that time, everyone's opportunity will come, so it's best to seize it!"

The opportunity was indeed rare! In truth, everyone felt a bit awkward, but they were still eager. They looked forward to advancing to rulers of laws within the Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth! Since Su Yu could secure such an opportunity for everyone, it was worth cherishing.

Soon, Grandstar was the first to step forward, bowing, "Thank you, Your Majesty! I... don't want to miss out again!"

Last time, out of the list of thirty, five hadn't broken through. The Great Xia King, Grandstar, Marquis Huoyun, Tian Ce, and the Space Ancient Emperor Devour Space. The others had their Daos occupied by their own race. The Great Xia King was because of his grandson Xia Longwu, and Grandstar simply missed the opportunity.

At this moment, he didn't want to fall behind!

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling, "The Human Emperor is a good person and an interesting one. He's actually easier to get along with than I am. You should be familiar with him! I hope all of you can become rulers of laws! In the future, when the Three Gates open, without being a ruler of laws, it will be difficult to participate in major events. If you miss this glorious era, when will the next era begin? Will there still be opportunities?"

Everyone took a deep breath and soon bowed in gratitude!

Opportunities were rare! Seizing them was the future!

And Su Yu also smiled, feeling quite pleased! The Human Emperor probably wouldn't refuse. In the early stages of Heaven and Earth, these aids were very much needed. The people Su Yu named were either Heavenly Kings or Heavenly Venerables. Of course, some hadn't reached the level of Heavenly Kings, but they could try!

Perhaps, by chance, they might break through?

As for the Great Xia King and the others, Su Yu didn't bother with them. These people had their own arrangements. Whether it was Su Yu's Heaven and Earth or the Human Emperor's, they were both prone to destruction. Strictly speaking, the River of Time was still the most stable, at least for now, without any major issues.

"Then everyone, prepare yourselves and wait for the Human Emperor's return. I will soon head to the front lines to replace the Human Emperor and let him return!"

The Human Emperor hadn't returned, and Su Yu understood his thoughts. He was waiting for Su Yu to return! He wasn't comfortable leaving if Su Yu wasn't there, as it could easily lead to trouble. Therefore, Su Yu needed to quickly resolve some matters and return to replace the Human Emperor.

After arranging these people, Su Yu looked at the newly advanced Marquis Huoyun and smiled, which made Marquis Huoyun feel a bit uneasy. Su Yu smiled warmly, "Marquis Huoyun, stay behind!"

Marquis Huoyun felt apprehensive but didn't dare to leave. Soon, the others departed, leaving only a few like the Book Spirit behind.

Su Yu glanced at the Book Spirit and, after some thought, said, "The Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth is not yet perfect or strong enough. For most people, I can place them in the Human Emperor's realm, but there's one person I want to place in the Culture King's realm to see if he can be revived..."

The Book Spirit's eyes flickered with a strange light, "I have no objections, but the owner of the realm isn't me; it's the master..."

Su Yu laughed, "No worries, the Culture King doesn't have a say in this. After all, he's not here. His opinion doesn't count! The Yue King has devoured the entire path of the spear, becoming incredibly powerful. Once he enters the realm, reaching the second tier is certain, and there's even hope for the first tier..."

Su Yu pondered for a moment and added, "The Human Emperor's realm is indeed challenging. If he attempts to break through, it might shatter the realm... His realm isn't strong enough yet!"

Otherwise, the Human Emperor's realm would have been a possibility, as the Yue King didn't reject the Human Emperor.

At this moment, Marquis Huoyun was left speechless, unable to find words for a long time. Finally, he managed to ask with difficulty, "Your Majesty... what do you mean?"

Su Yu smiled, "The Yue King! I've observed that he left behind a will, continuing to guard and complete his mission! I'll try to see if I can revive him! If the Yue King is revived... he'll be a powerful ally!"

"Really... really?" Marquis Huoyun was instantly excited. Su Yu nodded with a smile, "Of course, but I'll need your help... The premise is, does the Yue King trust you?"

"Of course!" Marquis Huoyun hurriedly replied, "My king trusts me the most..."

Nearby, the Great Zhou King and others rolled their eyes, and Marquis Huoyun immediately became angry, "Don't believe me? Back then, I was only weak in strength and couldn't follow my king. Otherwise, my king would have definitely taken me to the front lines!"

Su Yu laughed, "I don't know about that, but I'll remind you, if he doesn't trust you enough, once you move his body, he'll strike you with a thunderous blow, and you'll surely die! Don't think that just because you've become a ruler of laws, you're safe. You're barely at the fourth tier! His thunderous blow, even if not at the first tier, would severely injure a second-tier ruler of laws!"

This was a ruthless person who had devoured an entire Great Dao.

Marquis Huoyun gritted his teeth, "My king will definitely trust me. In the past, I followed him in battles across the world. He saved me many times, and I have also protected him countless times... As long as Your Majesty can resurrect my king, I'll do anything!"

Su Yu nodded, "Let's give it a try! You move King Yue into the Culture King's domain. There's the aura of the Culture King there. How is his relationship with the Culture King?"

Marquis Huoyun thought for a moment and said, "Admiration. Back then, my king was... ahem, persuaded by the Culture King and joined the Human Emperor's system. So, their relationship has always been good!"

Su Yu chuckled again and nodded, "That's good. Book Spirit, you are responsible for sorting out the spear dao in the Culture King's domain. I will handle reconnecting his dao with the domain. As for the Great Zhou King, you have a task too..."

The Great Zhou King was puzzled, "I don't understand this..."

"You are responsible for silencing King Yue's willpower to prevent him from suddenly exploding and blowing himself up!"

Alright, understood!

Su Yu continued, "With the Culture King absent, if King Yue revives in his domain and reconnects with the spear dao, he might be able to control a lot of the domain's power. This could potentially add a top-tier first-class existence to our side!"

"If King Yue survives, it could be a blessing in disguise. He has nurtured the spear dao for a full ten thousand years!"

Swallowing the dao and nurturing it for ten thousand years, a former third-class powerhouse, reconnecting with the Culture King's spear dao, Su Yu calculated that reaching second-class was inevitable, and not just any second-class.

Whether he could reach first-class... depended on the Culture King himself!

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "If King Yue can revive and reach first-class, it would mean that the Culture King's dao power exceeds 32 paths. I wonder if he has reached that level?"

Has he?

Not necessarily outside, but within the domain, does the Culture King have the power of 32 paths?

If so, then there is hope to create a first-class.

This point, Su Yu couldn't be sure of.

Of course, according to the Human Emperor, back then, because they were the strongest, they were too lazy to divide further. But... who knows if the Human Emperor was boasting? If he wasn't, then the Culture King might have reached that level.

Everyone was speechless. So, you're speculating about the Culture King's combat power?

Is it necessary?

Su Yu quickly smiled again, "Alright, let's not waste time! Once we're done with King Yue's matter here, I won't stay in the Myriad Realms for long. I have to leave soon. I've been back for a while, and if I don't return, a day will have passed over there!"

"..."

The Great Zhou King and the others gritted their teeth but said nothing.

A day passing over there... does it count as much?

Even if you stayed here for a year, what difference would it make?

It must be said, Su Yu's utilization of time had truly reached the extreme!

Finishing one task, he immediately started the next, truly using a day as if it were a year!

...

Luminous Domain Mansion.

Ninth floor.

King Yue's body still floated in the air, standing proudly in the domain. That defiant expression, even in death, could not be concealed.

This was a human overlord, subdued by the Culture King, who joined the royal court and pledged allegiance to the Human Emperor.

He might not have truly submitted to the Human Emperor, but in his final moments, he remained loyal to his mission, loyal to the human race, choosing to stay behind and kill any Myriad Races experts attempting to escape.

For ten thousand years, his body remained unbroken, retaining a will, with only one belief: if the Myriad Races return, kill without mercy!

Upon first seeing King Yue, Marquis Huoyun wept bitterly.

Today, Marquis Huoyun's tears flowed freely, yet he did not cry out loud. Those tears held anticipation, joy, and longing!

King Yue might be resurrected!

To him, whether it was Su Yu or the Human Emperor, they ultimately fell short compared to King Yue, because this was his true master. He was a retainer of King Yue, and in that era, this was entirely different!

"My king, your humble servant has come to bring you back!"

Marquis Huoyun stepped towards King Yue. Su Yu slightly frowned, "Be careful. If King Yue thinks you're trying to move him or destroy his mission, he might kill you..."

He wasn't sure if it was possible. He couldn't intervene. If he did, and King Yue's last will judged him as an enemy, once he acted, Su Yu wasn't afraid—King Yue would be doomed, and no one could save him!

As Marquis Huoyun approached step by step, a faint will emerged from King Yue's body, and a spear intent shot skyward!

It seemed to say, take another step, and you'll be killed without mercy!

Marquis Huoyun prostrated himself on the ground, gritting his teeth, enduring the impact of the spear intent, his will trembling, "My king, I have come to revive you... not to make you give up. Your humble servant is here under the orders of the Human Emperor, Emperor Yu, and the Culture King to bring you back!"

King Yue had no reaction. Marquis Huoyun continued to approach, moving his body, bowing and scraping, continuing to approach King Yue.

Su Yu watched silently.

Would King Yue's will trust Marquis Huoyun?

Marquis Huoyun continued to approach, but King Yue's spear intent grew stronger and more terrifying. Su Yu slightly frowned. The next moment, he reached out, and a large seal appeared—the Human Lord Seal!

Then, Su Yu reached out again, and another large seal appeared—the Human Emperor Seal!

At this moment, with the Human Emperor absent, the control of this seal was also in Su Yu's hands.

After some thought, Su Yu looked at the Book Spirit. The Book Spirit understood, transforming into a book carrying the aura and will of the Culture King. Su Yu suspended the two seals and the book in the air, their aura erupting, and shouted, "Order, King Yue, return to the ranks, heal and await orders, receive the command!"

Boom!

The two seals and the book all erupted with powerful auras, covering the domain!

Yet, the spear intent on King Yue's body grew stronger, as if caught in confusion.

His will sensed something.

An order from familiar powerful figures!

Ordering him to return!

His mission was over!

At this moment, Marquis Huoyun's eyes lit up, and he shouted again, "My king, your humble servant welcomes you back. Please, my king, lay down your armor!"

Laying down armor signified the dissipation of battle intent.

It was also the key to determining whether King Yue had received these messages.

"Your humble servant, Huoyun, will lay down your armor!"

Marquis Huoyun suddenly stood up and walked towards King Yue. Su Yu slightly frowned. He wasn't sure if King Yue had received the messages, but with Marquis Huoyun taking the risk, Su Yu considered stopping him but ultimately did not.

Marquis Huoyun quickly approached, and Su Yu watched silently.

Moments later, Marquis Huoyun reached King Yue's side. The spear intent grew stronger, but Marquis Huoyun did not emit battle intent or unleash any power of the rules. He relied on his physical body, enduring, as the spear intent pierced him, leaving wounds all over.

Marquis Huoyun didn't care, revealing a particularly bright smile!

King Yue did not stop him!

It was merely the natural release of spear intent!

Gritting his teeth, he stepped forward and began to remove King Yue's armor.

The battle armor was long broken, yet it exuded a fierce aura. Marquis Huoyun gritted his teeth, his hands bleeding profusely, as he painstakingly removed the broken armor piece by piece.

Once the armor was removed, it was clear that King Yue's body was already in tatters, with gaping wounds appearing, quickly healing, only to be pierced again by the powerful spear intent.

At this moment, Marquis Huoyun was overjoyed, looking at Su Yu, who also smiled, "Not bad! Bring King Yue to the Sea of Stars, follow me, and don't move recklessly!"

Marquis Huoyun said nothing, quickly bowing, carrying King Yue on his back, feeling as if he was bearing a mountain. He dared not use the power of the rules, fearing it would provoke King Yue into a final strike!

In an instant, he was pierced all over, bleeding profusely, yet he was exceptionally excited, happily carrying King Yue, swiftly flying towards the Sea of Stars, not daring to let Marquis Tongtian teleport too far, lest something go wrong.

Thus, the group, after a while, finally reached the Sea of Stars.

Soon, a group of people followed Su Yu, entering the Culture King's domain.

At this moment, the Book Spirit quickly presented a dao.

Su Yu glanced at it, took a deep breath. If successful, King Yue would revive. If failed, King Yue would explode into pieces.

As for the outcome, it depended on luck.

His luck had always been good!

The next moment, Su Yu gave a low shout, reaching out to grab a dao force. It was the spear dao within the Culture King's domain, which he grabbed as if it were tangible.

This wasn't the key. The key was to draw out the spear dao within King Yue and reconnect it with the dao force!

Su Yu looked at the distant Great Zhou King and said in a deep voice, "I will provoke his dao to erupt. You must silence him in the instant his dao erupts but hasn't reached its peak. Whether he lives... depends on how well you seize this moment!"

Marquis Huoyun looked towards the Great Zhou King, showing a pleading gaze.

The Great Zhou King was helpless. Damn it, why are you looking at me?

It makes it seem like I'm the one in charge!

Despite his frustration, he quickly nodded, saying in a deep voice, "I will, Your Majesty. A loyal and righteous figure like King Yue... I also hope he can revive!"

"Then I... will begin!"

Su Yu gave a low shout. The next moment, a powerful will covered King Yue!

At this moment, the hostile killing intent enveloped King Yue. King Yue suddenly opened his eyes, filled with madness, endless killing intent, and shouted angrily, echoing through the domain!

"Kill!"

A long spear shot out from his body. This spear even unleashed a full 16 shadows, truly erupting with barely first-class combat power!

King Yue, a third-class, had nurtured the dao for ten thousand years. At this moment, he might be at his strongest, exhausting everything for this one spear!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King's face turned green.

First-class!

Damn it!

Can I suppress it?

He roared, "Silence!"

Boom!

The dao force erupted, covering King Yue, yet it couldn't suppress him. The dao force instantly collapsed. The Great Zhou King was furious, roaring again, unleashing 10 dao forces simultaneously!

Boom!

Suppression!

But it still wasn't enough, unable to suppress!

King Yue had nurtured the dao for ten thousand years. This spear was too strong. At this moment, the overwhelming killing intent caused the Great Zhou King to continuously cough up blood!

Seeing no other way, the Great Zhou King roared, "Calm! Steady! Composed!"

Rumble!

In an instant, six strands of Dao power erupted from his body once more. However, these six strands were insufficient, as they were not fully mastered, only giving off a faint aura of a Heavenly King. These were the Daos he hadn't severed, yet none had reached the level of a ruler of laws.

The Great Zhou King had mastered many Daos, but unfortunately, many had not reached that level. He roared again, a frenzied roar, as seven or eight weak paths emerged from his body. Yet, there were indeed many Daos!

He needed to suppress King Yue!

Suddenly, multiple Daos burst forth again, and at that moment, the Book Spirit intervened. With a wave of its hand, seven or eight strands of Dao power suppressed the area, muttering, "This is the Culture King's domain, Your Majesty... Why test him further? There's nothing hidden anymore, especially at a time like this."

The Great Zhou King was slightly taken aback, suddenly looking at Su Yu. Over there, Su Yu remained calm, and as the Book Spirit suppressed King Yue, Su Yu grinned at the Great Zhou King, "Forgotten!"

"I..."

The Great Zhou King spat out a mouthful of old blood. Damn you!

Are you playing with me?

Su Yu shrugged, "Not playing with you, just checking if you had any complete Daos left unmerged. Hmm, not bad, none left, though it's a bit of a pity. You really are just the master of ten Daos! The other Daos haven't reached that level. I'm quite disappointed; it seems difficult for you to reach the first tier."

Ignoring the Great Zhou King, Su Yu instantly grew serious. Taking advantage of the moment when King Yue was suppressed, he grabbed King Yue's spear Dao, shouting as he forcibly connected the two spear Daos!

The Book Spirit suppressed!

At that moment, a faint willpower emerged from the heavens, from Su Yu's Heaven Gate, carrying a hint of confusion, "What are you doing..."

"Shut up, borrowing a Dao!"

"..."

That was the Culture King's voice. The Culture King had just obtained the shoes and wanted to do something when he suddenly sensed some disturbance in his domain. Previously, he might not have been able to sense it, but with the shoes, he could feel some of it.

Taking advantage of the momentary turmoil in the domain, he transmitted a bit of willpower over, only to be scolded!

The Culture King was stunned!

I got scolded?

This is Su Yu, right?

Damn!

I got scolded?

What's going on!

This is my domain, and you seem to be up to no good in it. I just asked, and you scolded me?

He's not the Human Emperor; the Human Emperor is an honest man. He's more arrogant and wanted to lose his temper, but after considering it, he decided against it. After all, damn it, the domain is outside, and I'm inside. Losing my temper is useless. The key is, his Book Spirit didn't resist... It seems Su Yu, that brat, has tricked my Book Spirit!

The faint willpower of the Culture King quickly retreated. If he hadn't sensed the anomaly in the domain, he wouldn't have extended it. It's too dangerous, too easy to be detected.

This thing can only be used at critical moments.

Quickly, the Culture King's willpower retreated because he knew that a madman like Su Yu might do the same as him. If he didn't retreat, Su Yu might blow up his willpower.

This is the biggest difference between the Culture King and the Human Emperor. The Human Emperor had his willpower blown up by Su Yu several times, while the Culture King was much more cunning because he liked doing such things too!

Sure enough, just as Su Yu was about to shatter the Culture King's meddling willpower, he suddenly paused... Damn, he ran away?

So fast!

So, you really just came to ask a question?

And then nothing!

No time to worry about that now. At this moment, Su Yu let out a low roar, forcibly merging the two spear Daos. The power of the healing Dao erupted instantly, merging the two Daos together!

Boom!

A long spear spanned the entire domain!

Below, King Yue's eyes opened, filled with intense killing intent. He roared, "Kill!"

Suddenly, the spear in the sky was in his hand, and he thrust it towards Su Yu!

The spear carried endless killing intent, endless madness, and immense power, aiming to pierce through everything and kill Su Yu!

At that moment, Su Yu smiled, baring his teeth, "Book Spirit!"

The Book Spirit instantly understood, suppressing King Yue and empowering Su Yu. Outside Su Yu's body, eighteen golden dragons shot out!

Here, although it's not my domain... I'm a guest here, and I want to be the host. Even if it's not my domain, I'm still the boss!

At this moment, the power of Su Yu's domain, the Human Emperor's domain, and the Culture King's domain simultaneously suppressed King Yue!

In the blink of an eye, King Yue's aura was suppressed to the extreme.

And Su Yu, at his peak strength.

A punch was thrown!

With a loud bang, the punch sent King Yue flying millions of meters. In the blink of an eye, he reappeared in front of Su Yu, who continued to punch. In the distance, Marquis Huoyun's mouth hung open, wanting to shout something, but... nothing came out.

Clearly, Su Yu felt that King Yue, having just been resurrected, suddenly attacking him was unfriendly. And Su Yu loved teaching the unruly a lesson!

The Culture King subdued you back then, and so can I!

Boom!

A series of loud noises erupted as Su Yu relentlessly attacked. King Yue, suppressed to a second-tier level, was being pummeled by a first-tier powerhouse like Su Yu. After about three minutes, King Yue's face was swollen, his head resembling a pig's, as Su Yu pinned him to the ground and hammered away!

Moments later, Su Yu stood up, dusted off his robe, and smiled, "A scholar fighting is a disgrace to the scholarly world!"

With a flick of his robe, he said calmly, "Ask Marquis Huoyun, then come to me for orders! Alright, everyone, let's go. Give them enough time to talk. I believe King Yue will know what to do!"

Su Yu floated away, leaving King Yue in immense pain, gritting his teeth, "Who are you?"

No need for Su Yu to answer, Marquis Tongtian chuckled, "Emperor Yu, whose achievements surpass the Human Emperor and the Culture King! Even the Human Emperor and the Culture King follow Emperor Yu, King Yue, take good care of your injuries!"

With those words, the group disappeared!

King Yue's face changed colors, turning more purple, as he looked at the excited Marquis Huoyun. After a long while, he finally said, "I... am resurrected?"

Marquis Huoyun nodded eagerly, his entire being floating with excitement. King Yue had been resurrected!

And he was powerful!

Although he looked a bit miserable at the moment, having attacked Su Yu and not been killed, only beaten black and blue... Marquis Huoyun felt this was entirely acceptable!

King Yue looked at him, then at the direction Su Yu had left, and then at the domain they were in. For a moment, countless doubts surged in his mind.

"Emperor Yu?"

He murmured, what was going on? The Human Emperor and the Culture King were defeated by him?

Impossible!

"Huoyun, tell me everything!"

King Yue's voice was low, and Marquis Huoyun nodded eagerly, filled with excitement, but unsure where to start. After a long time, he finally uttered the first sentence, "The number one person not to provoke in the Myriad Realms is Emperor Yu... very terrifying... My King, let's not think about revenge. We'll be beaten badly, and there will be black history left behind. Earlier, I saw Marquis Tongtian recording your image..."

King Yue was bewildered, what nonsense?

And Marquis Huoyun quickly suppressed these thoughts. Forget it, My King doesn't understand. Black history is just black history. Who doesn't have a bit of black history?

Soon, he began explaining everything that had happened over the past hundred thousand years to King Yue.

The beginning was brief, but when he got to the recent years, Su Yu's name kept coming up. The more King Yue listened, the stranger it felt. So bizarre?

In just a few years, he suppressed the ancient times?

It felt... terrifying!
