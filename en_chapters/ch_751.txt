Chapter 751: Exhausting All Resources (Subscription Request)

This battle left everyone dumbfounded. Even Yuehao and his group were stunned!

Was it a loss? Not necessarily!

In this single battle, several Heavenly Kings from the opposing side perished, including top-tier Daofuse Realm cultivators. Of course, they did suffer a slight loss, as they lost a Heavenly Sovereign. But didn't the Torchbearers have limited resources? If this battle continued, wouldn't it deplete their reserves?

It was beyond imagination that the Torchbearers could gather so many Heavenly Kings. Yet today, this mysterious faction suddenly went berserk, seemingly destroying themselves in the process.

Fireworks continued to rise.

The entire mountain behind the Chaos Forest had turned into a massive crater, a giant pit!

"Strike while the iron is hot!"

At that moment, March roared in fury, swinging a bamboo staff that caused the heavens and earth to tremble, making the entire Chaos Forest shudder violently! A massive Chaos Bird was struck out by his bamboo staff!

March shouted, "Kill! Are we going to wait for them to recover? Even if we can't kill the Heavenly Sovereigns, we can at least kill those two Heavenly Kings!"

Upon hearing this, although the Moon Heavenly Sovereign and others felt a bit strange, they still charged forward!

March was right!

At this moment, March seemed a bit out of control. To the Moon Heavenly Sovereign and others, perhaps they knew something. March likely had some connection with the Torchbearers. Now, with the Torchbearers suddenly going mad and suffering heavy casualties, it was no wonder March was eager for revenge. No wonder he had been at the forefront all day.

Currently, there were only four Heavenly Sovereigns and two Heavenly Kings on the opposing side. And they were all in a weakened state after the battle.

Of course, there was still a Heavenly Sovereign-level giant bird in the Chaos Forest, and a massive crocodile-like beast in the Chaos River, which was not a Heavenly Sovereign but a Heavenly King-level creature. Very strong!

But there were nine Heavenly Sovereigns present!

"Kill!"

With a shout, the nine Heavenly Sovereigns charged forward!

Not seizing this opportunity to kick them while they're down would be a disservice to the situation the Torchbearers had created. What if there were four Heavenly Sovereigns? Even with that giant bird, there were only five. Two against one was almost a given!

On the other side, Yuehao and his group turned pale.

"Retreat!"

With a furious shout, they could no longer care about much else and retreated!

If they didn't retreat, they might truly be doomed.

In the distance, a powerful aura surged!

It seemed to be the aura of the ancestor of this race. However, the nine Heavenly Sovereigns glanced at it and, in the next moment, ignored it, sweeping through madly.

An unparalleled expert of the Chaos Race?

The Torchbearers were right!

This race was indeed incredibly powerful.

That aura was unsettling, perhaps... perhaps it truly had the power of a master of laws. But so what?

A master of laws... even a master of laws had to be judged by their realm. The weak ones could definitely be matched by three Heavenly Sovereigns!

At worst, it would be a fight!

Boom!

At this moment, the nine Heavenly Sovereigns erupted with their auras, each one powerful enough to shake the entire world. The ancient beasts hesitated, wondering if they should continue.

In the Chaos Forest, the giant bird being crazily beaten by March let out a roar, suddenly spread its wings, and swiftly fled!

In the river, the giant crocodile also fled instantly.

Knowing they were outmatched, they chose to retreat. At their level, they had some wisdom. Retreat!

On the periphery, over twenty Daofuse Realm ancient beasts were killed by the nine Heavenly Sovereigns.

They knew it was dangerous!

At this moment, they all fled.

This battle affected not only Su Yu's side and the Chaos Race but also many ancient beasts in Chaos Mountain were killed.

Now, the nine Heavenly Sovereigns joined forces to attack that side!

Their killing intent shook the heavens!

"Kill!"

Boom!

From a distance, Dao Heavenly Sovereign unleashed massive divine characters, covering the sky and earth. The scriptures of the Great Dao even transformed into books, attacking forward.

Archaic Heavenly Sovereign stomped the ground, causing it to tremble violently. Ahead, countless earthen walls transformed into giants, charging towards Yuehao and his group.

The various Heavenly Sovereigns unleashed their full power.

The aura was chaotic!

At this moment, Mo Heavenly Sovereign and Demon Heavenly Sovereign seemed to be brewing something. In the next moment, a surge of demonic energy rose.

"Demon Descent!"

With a low shout, the two powerful Demon Race experts seemed to summon something extraordinary. In the void, a demonic shadow appeared, as if stepping out from the past and future, instantly descending among Yuehao and his group.

The massive figure covered the sky and earth, and with a boom, it stomped the recently escaped Purple Water Heavenly King into pieces!

"Bastards!"

Yuehao and his group were furious!

On the opposite side, the Heavenly Sovereigns quickly approached.

Bastards?

Kill you, and you'll know what bastards are!

The opportunity was rare!

If they encountered them on a normal day, they would be hard to deal with. Four Heavenly Sovereigns, multiple Heavenly Kings, dozens of Daofuse Realm, and a large number of ancient beasts...

Truly hard to deal with.

But today, their location was exposed, their strength was exposed, and the nine Heavenly Sovereigns were not to be trifled with.

Moreover, after a fierce battle, these guys did not achieve victory but instead paid a heavy price to repel the Torchbearers. Yuehao's Gate of Hell was even blown up, so what arrogance was left?

The demonic shadow appeared, directly stomping a Heavenly King to death!

This showed the strength of the demonic shadow, a racial ability of the Demon Race, Demon Descent!

Summoning a powerful Demon Race expert from the void, calling upon their past and future powers. The two Heavenly Sovereigns summoned it together, making it even stronger than a single Heavenly Sovereign.

At this moment, Mo Heavenly Sovereign and Demon Heavenly Sovereign were controlling this demonic shadow, sweeping across the four Heavenly Sovereigns!

And the Chaos Race, the four Heavenly Sovereigns were also roaring continuously.

Among them, someone cultivated the path of chaos, and with a punch, the heavens and earth shattered, and the Great Dao trembled.

Fighting while retreating!

Four against nine, clearly outmatched.

As for the only surviving Heavenly King, Yuxi, he didn't participate in the battle at all, nor did he have the strength to, quickly fleeing.

In the distance, powerful auras erupted.

A furious shout echoed through the heavens and earth: "You dare court death!"

Boom!

In the next moment, that aura pierced through the void, shattering it with extreme speed, directly escaping into the sky.

The faces of the several Heavenly Sovereigns turned serious!

Was it a master of laws?

Or a powerhouse on the level of Hundred Battle?

They couldn't determine.

But they all knew the opponent was very strong.

"Ming Heavenly Sovereign, Moon Heavenly Sovereign, Destiny, Thunderstorm, you four go to meet them!"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign gave a low shout. He, along with Archaic Heavenly Sovereign and the two from the Demon Race, plus March, would suppress Yuehao's group with five against four. If they could kill, they would kill. If not, they would see!

First, test the strength of this top-tier expert of the Chaos Race!

The four Heavenly Sovereigns didn't say much, quickly breaking through the void.

At this juncture, this race was too strong.

Whether it was a life-and-death battle or not, they had to try.

Boom!

A massive roar instantly echoed through the heavens and earth. With a loud bang, a Nether River appeared in the void, and in the blink of an eye, it was shattered by a punch. Ming Heavenly Sovereign's figure appeared, spitting blood, with a look of horror.

And at this moment, Dao Heavenly Sovereign gave an angry shout: "Dragon and Phoenix Sovereigns, come to assist in battle!"

"Roar!"

"Clang!"

Dragon and phoenix cries resounded. In the distance, a dragon and a phoenix, outside the Chaos Mountain, broke through the void and charged towards this side, but it would take time!

And at this moment, in the void, the unparalleled expert who shattered the Nether River roared: "Come!"

In the distance, more auras surged!

The old man roared: "Do you want a life-and-death battle today? Then I'll kill you!"

The nine Heavenly Sovereigns were all shaken!

How strong was this lineage?

At the moment the old man roared, behind him, more Heavenly Sovereign auras appeared, along with multiple Heavenly King auras. Not only that, but the roars of numerous ancient beasts echoed through the heavens and earth.

The old man roared: "Do you insist on a life-and-death battle, forcing the ancient beasts to encircle you?"

At this moment, the two ancient beasts that had fled earlier somehow gathered a large number of ancient beasts. Due to the repelling force of the Heavenly Sovereigns, they were all charging towards this side, filled with madness!

They didn't care who was from the Chaos Race or the myriad races.

They only recognized auras!

Repelled by the chaotic aura, they were enemies.

The Chaos Race had jade talismans, but once engaged in battle, would the ancient beasts care if you had a jade talisman?

On normal days, it was fine to hide your tracks, but now, in large-scale battles, attracting a large number of ancient beasts, it was useless.

"Kill!"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign shouted again. Regardless, before the ancient beasts encircled them, they had to see if they could kill one. He transmitted to the others quickly: "Kill that injured one!"

He was referring to Yuehao!

He had been blown up by the Great Zhou King, stomped several times by Fat Ball with the Culture King's boots, and bitten many times by Fat Ball's Great Dao.

He was also seriously injured at the moment.

Dao Heavenly Sovereign and the others were not prepared for a life-and-death battle now!

However, if they could kill a Heavenly Sovereign, that would be the best outcome.

As for killing a Heavenly King, what was that?

A severely injured Heavenly King, and with nine Heavenly Sovereigns attacking together, it would be strange if they couldn't kill a Heavenly King.

The five Heavenly Sovereigns, for once, had some tacit understanding and attacked Yuehao together!

Yuehao was also aggrieved!

On a normal day, any of these five coming alone wouldn't scare him, and he might even have a chance to win.

But now, after battling Fat Ball for a long time and having his Gate of Hell blown up by the Great Zhou King, his strength was greatly reduced!

At this moment, the Iron Devourer Race's March was insanely attacking him with a giant bamboo, and the demonic shadow summoned by the Demon Race was rapidly countering the three Heavenly Sovereigns. He was being besieged by Dao Heavenly Sovereign and March!

"Ancestor!"

Yuehao roared.

At this moment, the ancestor in the void snorted coldly.

"You... are truly courting death!"

In the next moment, a portal appeared on his forehead. As soon as this portal appeared, an incredibly powerful aura leaked out, as if something extraordinary existed within the portal!

The ancestor threw the portal, hurling it towards Thunderstorm. Thunderstorm was about to strike but felt a chill in his heart and quickly retreated.

At this moment, two claws suddenly extended from the portal, reaching out to grab him!

Thunderstorm quickly retreated, but was grazed, and with a squelch, his leg's flesh instantly dissolved, a large chunk of flesh torn away!

The Ancestor, a formidable figure capable of contending with three top Heavenly Sovereigns, remained as fierce as ever. With a single punch, he sent Heavendoom flying, blood spurting from his mouth. Destiny Marquis and Moon Heavenly Venerable watched with grave expressions.

Destiny Marquis glanced over and shouted, "Thunderstorm, hold that gate! Controlling it comes at a cost!"

The Ancestor's face darkened. "Destiny, you ungrateful wretch!" He punched through the void, but Destiny, as if anticipating the move, dodged instantly. Yet, in the Ancestor's eyes, two portals appeared. "Can your Fate Clan evade me?" he sneered.

With a resounding crash, his fist struck Destiny Marquis, sending flesh and blood flying. Destiny Marquis's expression shifted slightly. He coldly declared, "A mere imitation of the Heaven Gate! It's just a projection of the Gate of Hell, not the real thing!"

Activating his Eye of Heaven, Destiny Marquis pointed a finger. The Ancestor, about to strike again, found his punch hitting nothing but air. Before him, there was no one.

Destiny Marquis scoffed, "You're no different from Hundred Battle back then... I dared to fight him, why not you? Moon Heavenly Venerable, break his Gate of Hell! It seals demons within. Break it and let him face the consequences!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable remained silent, swiftly moving towards Thunderstorm to shatter the Gate of Hell. Heavendoom quickly returned to join Destiny Marquis against the formidable Ancestor.

Four top Heavenly Sovereigns now joined forces against him. The Ancestor felt stifled. His first battle after emerging from seclusion, and he was besieged by four Heavenly Sovereigns. Even Hundred Battle hadn't faced such odds. His expression soured. How infuriating!

This sudden outbreak of war was unexpected, and five Heavenly Kings had already perished. As for Daofuse Realm experts, thirty had fallen, a loss even he found painful. The Chaos Race, though dormant for years, had recently lost six Heavenly Kings, thanks to Ziyan.

For any race, losing six Heavenly Kings at once was an unbearable loss. The battle raged on.

Suddenly, the air was thick with the presence of ancient beasts. Three or four dozen, with more converging from all directions. If this continued, it would escalate into a grand showdown.

At that moment, a sigh echoed from the depths of chaos, tinged with lamentation, as if something was awakening.

Simultaneously, atop Ren Mountain, within the Divine Race's territory, a radiant aura akin to the sun's corona surged forth—Coronal Heavenly Venerable! The elder brother of Moon Heavenly Venerable, his aura overshadowed the other Heavenly Sovereigns.

"Retreat!" Coronal Heavenly Venerable's voice boomed. "Occupy the outskirts of Chaos Mountain, using the Chaos Forest as a boundary! The Chaos Race... it seems we were right all those years ago. They are indeed formidable, with a powerful force lurking within!"

At this moment, the territories of the Immortal and Demon Races seemed to stir with rising auras.

Deep within Chaos Mountain, an overwhelming aura erupted, surpassing everyone, even the Ancestor. A sigh, carrying a feminine tone, whispered, "Use the Chaos Forest as a boundary, withdraw!"

"Don't force my hand!" The female voice carried a hint of melancholy.

Destiny Marquis's gaze shifted, and he snorted coldly, "Stop pretending! Come out from behind the Gate of Hell first!"

His Eye of Heaven activated, no longer the amiable figure of usual, but imposing and stern. "I see through the heavens and earth. Your clan... is destined to decline and perish!"

"Life or death, it's not for you to question," the sigh replied, tinged with helplessness and sorrow. Suddenly, Destiny Marquis's brow split open, his Eye of Heaven shattered.

The Ancestor seized the opportunity, launching a punch. Boom! Destiny Marquis was sent flying, blood gushing.

The Ancestor's expression was grim. With a cold snort, the Gate of Hell swept across the heavens, repelling Thunderstorm and Moon Heavenly Venerable, and in an instant, suppressed the Demon Race's projection.

Boom! The projection shattered. The Ancestor reached out, capturing Yuehao and others, while March took the chance to strike with a bamboo, blasting half of Yuehao's head. The Ancestor then retreated with everyone, vanishing in an instant.

March wanted to pursue but paused, glancing around with anger. Seeing the ancient beasts surrounding them, he said nothing, sealing General Xuelan, who was frozen in place, into his bamboo. The others frowned but remained silent.

Earlier, Youzhen's self-detonation had shattered Xuelan's body, but her sea of will had unleashed a powerful force, freezing it. Now, with the enemy repelled, March took the opportunity to seize her, and the others said nothing.

"Retreat!" Dao Heavenly Venerable commanded swiftly. The ancient beasts were too numerous. Continuing the fight would mean being surrounded and slaughtered by them.

The nine Heavenly Sovereigns quickly withdrew. Soon, they regrouped with the Dragon and Phoenix Races' Heavenly Sovereigns, totaling eleven, and flew towards Ren Mountain.

The eleven Heavenly Sovereigns were solemn. The enemy was strong! Not only the four Heavenly Sovereigns, but the Ancestor who appeared later might possess the strength of Hundred Battle from back then. And the aura that emerged later might be even stronger, possibly a true master of the power of laws!

As for the Coronal Heavenly Venerable of the Divine Race on Ren Mountain, though strong, he might be inferior to the Ancestor. The myriad races were strong because of their numerous Heavenly Sovereigns!

Including Coronal Heavenly Venerable, there were now twelve exposed Heavenly Sovereigns! Of course, the Chaos Race wasn't weak either. Later, two more Heavenly Sovereign auras were exposed. Including the deceased one, there were seven Heavenly Sovereigns and two even stronger beings!

This left the group in shock. The Torchbearers hadn't lied. The reality might be even more severe than they claimed!

Why hadn't that old fellow from the depths emerged? They all turned to Destiny Marquis, who was gravely injured. Seeing their gazes, he spoke in a low voice, "She seems to be behind the Gate of Hell, unable to come out easily. I couldn't see clearly. The Gate of Hell shattered my Eye of Heaven. Without the Heaven Gate, ordinary probing techniques can't delve deep."

Dao Heavenly Venerable took a deep breath. "No matter! The Torchbearers have indeed drawn out these folks. They are formidable! But... we are not afraid! To think they can be the players, how laughable. Together, we can kill even a master of the power of laws!"

Desolate Heavenly Venerable coldly added, "If not for the restrictions of the world's laws, we would all be masters of the power of laws. Why fear one or two? Once the world's seal is lifted, there will be over a dozen masters of the power of laws. If the Chaos Race wants war, let them!"

Though they lacked the combat power of masters of the power of laws, they possessed equivalent realms, akin to the level of Human Kings in ancient times!

At this moment, each of them exuded powerful auras, filled with both shock and anger. What a formidable Chaos Race! Hidden in the shadows for so many years, this lineage had accumulated terrifying strength!

Previously, they suspected this race wasn't weak, but they hadn't expected them to be this strong. The Torchbearers warned that if the myriad races weren't united, they might be breached. It wasn't a lie.

This time, the Torchbearers had truly gone mad. So many had died! Why did this lineage do this?

Ah, Heavenly Dragon Marquis! He's still alive, and so is Xuelan, but she might not know much. She had just emerged and was quickly sent away before the battle erupted!

A group of Heavenly Sovereigns swiftly ascended Ren Mountain. Moon Heavenly Venerable's voice resonated, "Seal Chaos Mountain! No one, not even ancient beasts, is allowed to enter or leave!"

Numerous powerful figures began to disperse, flying in all directions to seal the exits of Chaos Mountain.

...

Soon, in the grand hall of Ren Mountain, a figure sat, radiant like the sun, Coronal Heavenly Venerable of the Divine Race. With the return of the eleven Heavenly Sovereigns, there were now twelve present.

Next, Heavenly Dragon Marquis's sea of will was cast out. Dao Heavenly Venerable waved his hand, infusing it with life force. In the blink of an eye, Heavenly Dragon Marquis's body reappeared, though not as strong as before, still carrying some confusion and fear.

Seeing the powerful figures present, he gasped and quickly bowed. "Heavenly Dragon greets the esteemed ones!"

Twelve! Terrifying!

Fortunately, he saw a strong figure from the Dragon Race, cautiously asking, "You... are you... Jade Dragon Marquis?"

Jade Dragon Marquis looked at him, frowning slightly, and nodded. "Explain the situation. How did you end up with the Torchbearers?"

Beside the Dragon Race figure, a woman in human form, also annoyed, asked, "Why did I sense the Phoenix Emperor of our lower realm was killed?"

Heavenly Dragon Marquis hurriedly replied, "We were all captured by Su Yu..."

"Su Yu?"

"The Human Lord of the lower realm!"

Heavenly Dragon Marquis quickly explained, "We were ambushed and captured in the lower realm..."

"What does he look like?"

Heavenly Dragon Marquis quickly conjured an image. Moon Heavenly Venerable, upon seeing it, frowned slightly. "It's him! Zhou Tiandao, the vice leader of the Torchbearers, grandson of Zhou Tian..."

Su Yu? The crowd was surprised. The Human Lord? A formidable figure!

This time, it seemed he led a few to escape. The battle seemed to be orchestrated by him. They had seen Zhou Tian, but his strength didn't seem to reach the level of a Heavenly Sovereign, and he self-detonated in the end!

Honestly, they didn't quite understand this battle!

Moon Heavenly Venerable, who hadn't spoken much, quickly asked, "Explain the situation in the lower realm, and who exactly is this Su Yu? Weren't you captured by the Torchbearers?"

"The Torchbearers?"

Heavenly Dragon Marquis hurriedly said, "That lineage has perished. No, wait, the Great Zhou King from the lower realm is still alive, the one who later self-destructed! He should be from the Torchbearer lineage! The Torchbearer lineage has long been gone. In this battle, I sensed something... Su Yu brought his people and started a massacre... That madman, he actually dared to come to the Upper Realm!"

"Su Yu... a madman?"

Several people looked at him, making the Heavenly Dragon Marquis extremely nervous. He quickly added, "I was captured by him, not one of his accomplices! Marquis Yuan Sheng and the others know this. I descended to the lower realm because something happened with the Dragon Clan. That's why I went down! Later, I was captured, and when I reappeared, it was now, forced to self-destruct my Great Dao. Fortunately, after several self-destructions, the Ape Emperor and the Kunpeng Half-Emperor self-destructed and died, allowing me to escape by sheer luck..."

Moon Heavenly Venerable frowned, "You're saying that this time, it wasn't the Torchbearer lineage that acted, but the Human Lord from the lower realm who brought people up here to fight. Is that what you mean?"

"Exactly!"

He nodded quickly, "In the lower realm, everything is completely different now! That Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, his strength is formidable, and he has attracted many powerful figures. Hongmeng, Doubao, and June have all pledged allegiance to him! Under his command are many strong individuals, the prodigies of this era. Lantian, Wan Tiansheng, the Great Qin King, and the Great Xia King are all top-tier experts under him. Even the Great Zhou King of the Torchbearer lineage has been subdued by him to fight in the lower realm..."

He was worried about being considered an accomplice, so he hurriedly spilled everything he knew.

At this moment, everyone's expressions changed drastically.

The Torchbearer lineage no longer exists!

That lineage is gone!

Only a so-called Great Zhou King remains, and even he has joined Su Yu!

According to the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, the people who just fought seemed to be all the strength they imagined the Torchbearer lineage had. Except for a few like Hongmeng and June who didn't participate, it seemed... they all perished!

Many looked at March, who remained calm and silent.

Seeing this, the others said nothing.

March might have connections with that lineage.

But now, that lineage... is in trouble!

Moon Heavenly Venerable slightly furrowed his brows, "You're saying that this battle was almost their entire strength! Why would Su Yu do this? Not only did he squander all his accumulated strength, but he also sacrificed those ancient human experts he had subdued!"

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis shook his head. Seeing Moon Heavenly Venerable's dissatisfaction, he quickly said, "Maybe it's because he hates this so-called Chaos lineage... I don't know the exact situation. Could you explain it to me, my lords?"

"Descendants of the Control King!"

With a simple sentence, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis instantly understood. He quickly said, "Then it makes sense! Su Yu is the heir of the Culture King, and the Control King lineage has been hunting down the Culture King's legacy in the lower realm. Su Yu's teacher's entire family was killed by the descendants of the Control King lineage, and his grandmaster was also killed by them. He hates this lineage the most and once personally killed the human traitor, the Silk Destroying King, from this lineage..."

"Moreover, Su Yu is someone who never lets grudges go unavenged, and he is extremely arrogant and domineering!"

He hurriedly added, "This person is exceptionally talented, actually very young, only in his twenties according to the Human Calendar. He is always true to his word, and no one is allowed to contradict his opinions!"

"I heard he ordered someone to self-destruct... That's just his nature, extremely ruthless. Once a battle encounters a crisis, he will stop at nothing to inflict massive losses on the enemy..."

He quickly said, "My lords, I am truly not his accomplice! Oh, and that dog, I know it too! That's the Culture King's dog, which appeared back then with immense power. Su Yu inherited the Culture King's legacy, so the dog follows him! In the lower realm, he is tyrannical, killing countless. Now, apart from the three major clans, I think he has probably subdued all other clans... I never expected him to bring people to the Upper Realm!"

"In this battle, his subordinates, except those left in the lower realm, I think, might have all perished..."

"He is terrifying!"

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis still expressed Su Yu's terrifying nature, trembling with fear, "I fought against him not long ago, just after I descended to the lower realm. At that time, he only had Daofuse Realm combat power, and suddenly he became a quasi-king... Not just him, Wan Tiansheng, Lantian, these people were weak before, and suddenly they all became so strong. Wan Tiansheng was already strong after killing the Nether Emperor in the lower realm, but Lantian was very weak before... I never expected him to become a Heavenly King too!"

"He opened the Heaven Gate!"

Destiny Marquis said calmly, "Opening the Heaven Gate, as long as they find the right Great Dao, it's possible for them to become powerful quickly. It's not surprising, but it also requires these people to have astonishing talent and deep foundations. Otherwise, not everyone can become a quasi-king!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable and the others exchanged strange glances, "So, this arrogant Human Lord is not actually from the Torchbearer lineage. He just borrowed the name of that lineage to act in the Upper Realm, and then... he learned about the Chaos Clan as his enemy, so... he brought people to fight them to the death?"

This is too crazy!

According to the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, those quasi-kings were all Su Yu's accumulated strength until now. Now, he took away Fat Ball, and maybe there's still a Hongmeng in the lower realm. Apart from them, there might not be any strong ones left?

What is this guy after?

Just for revenge?

Because the Control King lineage provoked him in the lower realm, killed his teacher's entire family, and killed his grandmaster, so he wants revenge?

A crazy revenge!

Too crazy!

Everyone frowned, and Sun Corona Heavenly Venerable said softly, "Let's not talk about Su Yu for now. Let's talk about this Chaos lineage. They are strong. When Moon Luo sealed Hundred Battle, we speculated whether there were still some strong ones hidden in the dark. Now, it's proven! Not just some, but many! In one battle, five quasi-kings died, one Heavenly Venerable, and thirty Daofuse. The other side is still strong..."

He felt a headache and sighed, "Is this considered an internal conflict among the human race? If it weren't for this insanely reckless Su Yu, maybe... we would have had to pay a huge price to probe the other side's strength."

It was somewhat laughable.

In the end, it was still the human race that helped them probe the strength of this Chaos Clan.

Moreover, the nine Heavenly Venerables' battle results were not significant. They only managed to kill a quasi-king by luck. Instead, Su Yu and his madmen, through self-destruction, forcibly blew up a large number of the other side's strong ones!

The key is, they even killed a Heavenly Venerable!

Too crazy!

Moon Heavenly Venerable and Demon Heavenly Venerable were somewhat relieved, relieved that they didn't act against Su Yu that day. Otherwise, if they had really fought that day, would these madmen have blown them up too?

There are still quite a few Heavenly Kings. With that dog, maybe they could really kill the two of them!

"The Culture King's heir... no wonder!"

Dao Heavenly Venerable said softly, "His talent is monstrously high, but at the last moment when he retreated, I saw... his pen dao seemed to have broken! This crazy guy, to kill that Heavenly Venerable, even broke his pen dao... his desire for revenge is too strong!"

At that moment, Su Yu could have retreated!

Including Wan Tiansheng!

The two had the hope of escaping, including taking Fat Ball with them. Of course, the result would be that they couldn't kill the Heavenly Venerable, but it wouldn't have ended up like this, with Wan Tiansheng dead and Su Yu's pen dao broken.

This force was instantly gone.

Only an injured Culture King's dog remained!

"Not only that, Marquis Nanxi and the others didn't seem to follow his orders... I heard Su Yu shout for them to self-destruct, but they didn't agree and broke out on their own..."

"That's normal! Those old guys aren't so easily swayed by a young man's orders!"

This point didn't surprise anyone.

No matter how monstrous Su Yu's talent is, he's still too young. Plus, Nanxi and the others had just returned not long ago. It's not so easy to die for him.

Destiny Marquis said with a complicated expression, "So... this lineage is considered finished... Even if Hongmeng becomes a quasi-king, along with that dog, maybe... only that dog and Hongmeng pose a threat now. The others, including Su Yu himself, have lost their deterrent power!"

He was still assessing!

According to some accounts from the River of Time, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis wasn't wrong. This was indeed all of Su Yu's strength!

He was still thinking that if Su Yu lay low for a while, there might still be a chance.

But... why choose this way?

It's too disappointing!

Because of hatred?

If it was for hatred, sacrificing so many strong ones is too regrettable!

At this time, someone looked at March and said indifferently, "March, it seems a strong one from the Iron Devourer Race participated earlier..."

March coldly looked at him, his voice icy, "So what? Captured by him, is there a problem? As for June, whatever the Heavenly Dragon says? The Heavenly Dragon even self-destructed to help him kill a quasi-king, does that mean the Dragon Clan has a problem too?"

March rarely got angry, but now he was furious. The Demon Heaven who had just spoken immediately shut up, no longer provoking this guy.

This guy was definitely colluding with Su Yu's group.

The result was probably unexpected, that Su Yu's group suddenly launched a suicidal attack on the other side, causing Su Yu's side to lose ninety percent of their combat power!

They were already the weakest of the three sides, and now, any of the three major clans could crush them!

March didn't bother to say more, gritting his teeth, "I want the Giant Axe Marquis!"

Everyone frowned.

March said coldly, "What's wrong? They achieved it, not only killing a quasi-king but also a Heavenly Venerable. The Myriad Race Council shouldn't lack this bit of integrity, breaking promises. If so, how can they lead the myriad races? A promise is worth a thousand gold, release the Giant Axe!"

Everyone frowned again, and Moon Heavenly Venerable said indifferently, "March, think it through! Even if the Giant Axe is released, he may not help Su Yu. You must know, Nanxi and the others didn't follow his orders after being released, and that was before. Now... Su Yu's strong ones have almost all fallen. Do you think they can control a Heavenly Venerable?"

He looked at March and said, "Brother March, we understand your thoughts! But now... Brother March, think it over! Humans are humans, and outsiders are outsiders. Even if the Giant Axe leaves, he won't help Su Yu... Besides, Su Yu himself has severed his Great Dao. Do you think the Giant Axe Marquis would help a lunatic who has fallen to the Sunmoon Realm?"

He truly is a madman! Even he had to admit, Su Yu was indeed crazy!

March gritted his teeth and nodded after a moment, "Maybe you're right, maybe... Regardless, I think we should release the Giant Axe! Tell him that Su Yu paid a ransom for him. Now, Su Yu's people have been slaughtered by the Chaos Race. I want to ask the Giant Axe, will he avenge Su Yu or be ungrateful?"

He spoke in a low voice, "If humans don't help humans, if humans are ungrateful and ignore their saviors... naturally, my race won't bother either! The Giant Axe might be a benchmark! Everyone, this is my request. Release that guy and let him choose for himself. Let's see if he opposes us, or goes against the Chaos Race, or... continues to hide like a coward!"

The crowd frowned again.

Releasing a human Heavenly Sovereign... this wasn't a good choice!

March continued, "If the Giant Axe really goes to find Su Yu, with Su Yu's character, he will definitely find a way to retaliate against the Chaos Race again. Everyone... this madman is very crazy; he won't let it go! So many of his people have died, do you think he will just let it go? Even if his strength has greatly diminished this time, he still has a Heavenly Sovereign, and below he has Hongmeng! There are also some Daofuse Realm experts!"

Everyone was weighing the pros and cons.

Dao Heavenly Sovereign spoke softly, "But what if the Giant Axe doesn't go to Su Yu and instead wants to retaliate against our Myriad Races? A Heavenly Sovereign-level expert with no ties, if he secretly retaliates against us, it would be very troublesome!"

March looked at them, gritting his teeth after a moment, and shouted, "If he doesn't go against the Chaos Race, he should go find Su Yu and them, or go find Hundred Battle to deal with Moon Luo. If he attacks the Myriad Races... I, March, swear here, I will kill him! My Iron Devourer Race will never let him go!"

At this moment, he was much more direct, no longer naive, but full of anger, "I will make things clear to him, and I promise you all, if he really attacks the Myriad Races... I will abandon the Iron Devourer Race and hunt him down to the end! Everyone, is this enough?"

March was not of one mind with the Myriad Races, everyone knew this. He had still sided with Su Yu, but... luck wasn't on his side, and before he could act, Su Yu's side was almost finished!

At this moment, March seemed like a powder keg, ready to explode at any moment!

If they didn't release the Giant Axe, March might choose to rebel against the Myriad Races Council, or even work without effort. However, whether he sided with Su Yu or was of one mind with the Myriad Races, at this moment, he would deal with the Chaos Lineage!

Thinking of this, several Heavenly Sovereigns communicated secretly, and soon, Sun Corona Heavenly Sovereign chuckled, "Brother March, calm down. We didn't say we wouldn't release the Giant Axe! Since we caught him once, we can catch him a second time! Listen to Brother March, we'll release the Giant Axe later!"

He smiled, "The Myriad Races Council isn't afraid of a Heavenly Sovereign. None of us here are afraid of that Giant Axe! If he dares to do anything, we'll kill him and put an end to his thoughts!"

The Heavenly Sovereigns all nodded.

The Giant Axe was a small matter!

At this moment, everyone exchanged glances and became serious again, "The Giant Axe is not a concern. As for Su Yu... he might have fled to the lower realm. It's hard to judge the situation now, but the threat of the Chaos Race is right before us!"

"Everyone, this lineage... might have two rulers of laws. Besides the one who hasn't come, the old guy who did come is not much weaker than some of the weaker rulers of laws from back then! I'm afraid he can match Hundred Battle!"

With these words, everyone became serious again.

Troublesome!

Even Sun Corona Heavenly Sovereign might not be able to match him. Of course, there should be hope for a fight, but the probability of defeat was greater.

And Sun Corona Heavenly Sovereign said softly, "If it doesn't work, call out the other two brothers. The three of us should be able to take down that guy!"

With these words, some people had strange expressions.

The other two brothers... indeed, the three major races still had deep foundations!

They were probably referring to the Immortal and Demon Races!

Three strong experts joining forces, claiming to have confidence in taking down that old ancestor, this strength was extraordinary. You must know, previously, even four Heavenly Sovereigns joined forces, and they couldn't contend against the opponent.

But Dao Heavenly Sovereign and the others remained silent.

The Myriad Races still had their foundations.

The Human Race had foundations, and so did they.

In the last tide, even if Moon Luo hadn't sealed Hundred Battle, the Myriad Races might not have lost. Some old guys hadn't even made a move yet.

Of course, in a true life-and-death battle, the final result would definitely be mutual destruction.

"What about Hundred Battle?"

At this moment, Destiny Marquis suddenly frowned, "Did he really fight deep into Chaos Mountain, or what? Why is there no movement at all?"

Hundred Battle had no movement at all!

You must know, this time, it was the Human Race making a move, killing the Chaos Race. The Chaos Race was Hundred Battle's great enemy, yet there was no news from Hundred Battle. If Hundred Battle appeared, maybe it wouldn't have been so tragic this time!

Even if he was sealed, he could still deal with that Moon Hao!

"This brute Hundred Battle, could he have been sealed by Moon Luo again?"

Everyone looked at each other, speechless!

Maybe... it's really possible!

If so, this guy Hundred Battle, there's no saving him!
