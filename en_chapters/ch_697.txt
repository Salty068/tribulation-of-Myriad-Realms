Chapter 697: Opening the Path to Astonishment! (Please Subscribe)

After sending off Wan Tiansheng and the Great Zhou King, Su Yu sat on his throne, carefully studying the Hunting Heavens List.

The Path of Paper!

What is the Path of Paper?

The Hunting Heavens List itself is undoubtedly a powerful divine weapon, said to be modeled after the Book of Time. The Book of Time follows the path of unifying myriad ways, so what is the Path of Paper within the Hunting Heavens List?

In the Death Realm, the South King mentioned that resurrection might require the gathering of brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

The Path of the Brush has effects of strong attack and sealing.

The Path of Ink can strip away the path of the dead.

The Path of the Inkstone provides vitality.

The Path of Paper... what exactly is it?

"The Hunting Heavens List collects the aura of myriad races, covering the Myriad Realms, and even has the effect of gathering fortune..."

Holding the list, Su Yu silently pondered.

After a moment, he suddenly laughed.

In the next instant, three fragments appeared.

The Record of Myriad Laws!

This is the true name of the Hunting Heavens List.

"The Record of Myriad Laws, myriad laws... myriad ways... myriad realms..."

"Merge!"

With a low shout, the entire Eastern War Zone saw a massive golden tome appear above the palace in the void.

Golden patterns emerged on the tome.

Not only that, names began to appear within it.

Previously, there were the Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow Lists, as well as the Proving Dao List.

But at this moment, the words "Eternal List" vaguely appeared.

The pages unfolded instantly!

The Eternal List emerged!

However, Su Yu's expression changed slightly, and his aura erupted, covering the sky and blocking others from peeking.

Because just as the list appeared, he saw some familiar names, both Daofuse and Eternal!

Yes, Daofuse and Eternal.

They are essentially the same realm, which startled Su Yu. If others saw this, if the gods, demons, and immortals knew, wouldn't they discover the hidden strength on his side?

The Record of Myriad Laws is indeed terrifying.

Some names appeared, clearly indicating that nothing in the Myriad Realms could be hidden from the Hunting Heavens List.

Moreover, at this moment, the aura of the Hunting Heavens List rapidly grew stronger, even vaguely showing signs of covering the River of Time.

Su Yu watched silently.

His heart was shaken!

The Path of Paper!

What is the Path of Paper?

At this moment, Su Yu vaguely understood. It was a blank sheet of paper, and this paper had the effect of covering the sky.

Simply put, the River of Time is above, with its tributaries spreading down like the branches and leaves of a great tree, and this paper is the sky, isolating the entire River of Time and its tributaries.

According to Su Yu's previous explanation, it was like a grid appearing below, turning the entire grid into an airtight bag.

"Interesting!"

"Very strong!"

Su Yu murmured, but it seemed that the Hunting Heavens List was also incomplete, lacking something.

Various thoughts emerged in Su Yu's mind.

Is paper meant to conceal everything?

The Path of Paper, the Path of Covering the Sky!

Yes, at this moment, Su Yu understood what the Path of Paper among the brush, ink, paper, and inkstone was.

It is a path that conceals the secrets of heaven!

And at this moment, countless Blue Skies suddenly flew towards the palace. Although Blue Sky was unruly, he generally wouldn't come here unless invited, especially when Su Yu was in the hall.

But now, Blue Sky came.

Not only him, but many Blue Skies came.

The leading Blue Sky, whom Su Yu was familiar with, somewhat resembled Zhao Ming from the academy. At this moment, this Blue Sky had a peculiar expression, looking at the sky and quickly flying towards the hall.

Seeing Su Yu, he slightly bowed and quickly said, "Emperor Yu, what is this?"

"The Record of Myriad Laws!"

Su Yu smiled.

Blue Sky said solemnly, "No, I mean, what is this power of the great path?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "The Culture King called it the Path of Paper. I think it's the Path of Covering the Sky! Or perhaps, the Path of Concealing the Secrets of Heaven, or even the Path of Blocking the River of Time!"

Blue Sky was extremely serious. He couldn't see it, but he sensed something. After a long time, he said solemnly, "No, this is not called the Path of Paper, nor the Path of Covering the Sky! This is called the Path of All Living Beings!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. Are you trying to take away my naming rights?

Blue Sky remained serious, "All living beings are within my path; this is the Path of All Living Beings! You misunderstood. This is not to conceal the secrets of heaven, but to embrace, to embrace all living beings!"

As Blue Sky spoke, his form constantly changed, sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes human, sometimes demon, ever-changing, with various voices mixed, "Emperor Yu, you are wrong! This is the path of embracing all living beings! You think it's concealment, but it's not; it's just embracing, because the Path of All Living Beings is a path of tolerance!"

"I let all living beings be within my path!"

Blue Sky couldn't see it, but he could feel it.

"I give new life to all living beings, and they see me as their parent!"

Su Yu carefully sensed it, and after a long time, his expression changed.

He looked up at the sky again, at the still-recovering Hunting Heavens List, and after a while, he said solemnly, "This is not a complete path, or rather, it's just a prototype. Someone might have opened this path in the past, but it wasn't completed. Among the brush, ink, paper, and inkstone, only this path is incomplete!"

Blue Sky's voice overlapped, and countless Blue Skies spoke simultaneously, "Yes, it's incomplete! I can feel it! This is mine!"

Su Yu laughed.

How long has it been?

I've only ever taken from others, and now, Blue Sky is too arrogant. Not only does he want to take my naming rights, but in the blink of an eye, this Hunting Heavens List has become his?

Blue Sky smiled faintly, "Emperor Yu, this path is mine! I can feel it! Before, I never felt it, never had the desire to open a path, but today, I want to open a path!"

He smiled somewhat wickedly, "This path must be very interesting, especially interesting! It must be different from other great paths, right?"

Su Yu carefully looked at the sky, seriously observing.

After a long time, he nodded, "Very special! If you name it the Path of All Living Beings, then this path might require comprehending myriad ways, intercepting the power of myriad ways, and gathering them to forge a path!"

Su Yu said, thinking of himself, and suddenly laughed.

This... is indeed somewhat similar!

I am also walking this path, merging myriad ways into one, then opening the heavens and earth!

Is Blue Sky the same?

"No..."

At this moment, Blue Sky shook his head. He couldn't see, but he had an understanding of his own great path. He wasn't randomly increasing his clones!

"You are wrong!"

Su Yu really wanted to beat him up!

This isn't the first time you've said that. If you say it again, I'm going to get angry.

Can't I see the path more clearly than you?

Blue Sky smiled faintly, "I can feel it. I don't need to comprehend myriad ways. All ways converge, and all paths originate from the source. I just need to comprehend the path of the source, yes, the source!"

With that, he suddenly reached out towards Su Yu, grabbing the still-merging Hunting Heavens List.

Su Yu frowned.

Blue Sky, however, was somewhat frantic, "Give it to me, give it to me! I know, I want to open a path, give it to me!"

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng appeared, saying sternly, "Nonsense!"

He actually grabbed it directly!

Has Blue Sky gone mad?

Blue Sky, however, was frantic, "No, I really need it, I need this thing too much! This is a semi-finished product, not complete. Emperor Yu doesn't need this. If he uses this to open a path, he might die!"

A semi-finished product!

Su Yu's heart moved slightly.

Blue Sky quickly said, "I need this, I need it too much. I feel that if I don't open a path, today will be the day of my death!"

Su Yu's expression was solemn, and he said, "You want to open a path now?"

"Yes, I want to open a path!"

Su Yu looked at Wan Tiansheng, "Give it to him!"

Blue Sky instantly let out countless different laughs, "So, you are the Emperor, and Tiansheng can only be the King! Hehe, haha, hehe..."

He grabbed the Hunting Heavens List, and in Su Yu's eyes, Blue Sky seemed to go mad. Suddenly, he soared into the sky, directly tearing through the River of Time!

Not only that, at this moment, in the Myriad Realms, almost every place had a Blue Sky flying out.

Men, women, monsters, insects, flowers, even a mountain...

At this moment, countless eyes were drawn.

In the sealed realms, even some willpower appeared on the surface of the realms.

What is the Human Race doing again?

Countless Blue Skies suddenly flew towards the River of Time simultaneously.

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng instantly followed, tearing through the river. At this moment, Blue Sky had already stepped into the river!

He didn't move!

Holding the Hunting Heavens List, Blue Sky seemed to feel the power of the surging river, laughing eerily, "Interesting, so interesting! So that's how it is, so that's how it is!"

"Hahaha!"

He laughed wildly, and suddenly, he took a step forward, boom!

His body exploded!

He died!

Yes, at this moment, Blue Sky died.

Su Yu's expression changed slightly, as did Wan Tiansheng's.

Both of their expressions changed, just about to act, when suddenly, another Blue Sky appeared, walking out from the Record of Myriad Laws.

This Blue Sky chuckled, "Interesting, truly interesting! To hear the Dao in the morning, one can die in the evening! Today, I might die, and may not be able to open my own great path. Tiansheng, Su Yu, watch me! Watch me open a path, open this path of the heavens! Open this path of all living beings!"

Boom!

This figure exploded again, taking a step forward.

And at this moment, countless Blue Skies quickly merged into the Hunting Heavens List.

Soon, another Blue Sky walked out from the Hunting Heavens List, an old man with a touch of vicissitudes, holding the Hunting Heavens List, sighing, "This is just a semi-finished product. The Culture King didn't open a path, just gave me an idea and a prototype!"

"It seems the Culture King couldn't do it, I have to rely on myself. He didn't have the talent for this, he couldn't do it!"

He sneered at the Culture King.

Scholars belittle each other!

Su Yu had said this, Wan Tiansheng had actually said it too, and now, Blue Sky was saying it.

No way, the Culture King, since the opening of the heavens and earth, might be the epitome of a scholar in everyone's eyes.

The pinnacle of a civilized master!

A monster, of course, has to compare with the Culture King!

At this moment, that white-haired Blue Sky suddenly exploded, flesh and blood flying, the corpse falling into the River of Time, truly dead!

A clone perished!

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng followed step by step, their expressions extremely solemn, neither stopping nor speaking.

In the depths of the Allheaven Battlefield, a figure emerged from the Hunting Heaven List, a spectral Blue Sky, clutching the list tightly as he continued forward. With each step, his body cracked and shattered, and he lamented, "Such agony! This path is fraught with peril, destined to be paved with rivers of blood!"

"The suffering of all beings is my suffering too. I shall shield them and forge a path for all living things!"

With another step, his body exploded once more, leaving behind a lifeless corpse.

Su Yu, watching from a distance, began to understand the grim reality unfolding before him, his heart filled with dread. Wan Tiansheng, without hesitation, forcibly integrated a divine character into Su Yu's Heaven Gate, prompting a furious glare from Su Yu.

What was going on? These people had thrown all decorum to the wind today! It was outrageous to forcefully embed a divine character into his Heaven Gate, leaving Su Yu feeling violated.

Quickly, Wan Tiansheng created a small Heaven Gate of his own, withdrawing the divine character from Su Yu's Heaven Gate. Ignoring Su Yu's anger, he turned his attention to Blue Sky and the Hunting Heaven List, his voice heavy with concern. "He's gone mad! This guy has lost his mind!"

"Blue Sky, stop this madness! Do you even know what you're doing?"

"I know!" A seductive Blue Sky appeared, smiling coquettishly. "Tiansheng, of course I know! But I... I've always been a madman! I've said it before, 'To hear the Dao in the morning, one can die content by evening!' You all fear death, but I do not. What's the worst that can happen? Death?"

Boom!

The alluring figure exploded, her body falling into the river, staining its waters red. Yet, in the next moment, Blue Sky reappeared, still holding the Hunting Heaven List, moving forward with a hint of fear. "I'm so scared, Tiansheng, comfort me."

Wan Tiansheng frowned deeply.

The new Blue Sky, appearing as a timid young woman, trembled as she took each step. "I'm truly afraid! But the path is right beneath my feet, Tiansheng, I can't give up!"

Wan Tiansheng's expression grew more somber.

Boom!

Another Blue Sky exploded, paving the path with blood and flesh.

Su Yu's face was grave as he looked down. He understood now. He truly understood!

At this moment, beneath their feet, a bloody path appeared, following the main road. Even as the river's currents tried to wash it away, Su Yu could see the blood path solidifying, holding strong!

It was as if a bloodline had formed within the river!

Holding the Hunting Heaven List, countless Blue Skies entered it, using its power to obscure the secrets of the heavens and avoid the wrath of the River of Time!

Su Yu's heart trembled. This era was filled with individuals more ruthless than the last.

Wan Tiansheng had opened the Human Dao, and Su Yu thought that was ruthless enough. But even if he failed, he could still survive. Yet Blue Sky... this madman was truly pushing himself to the brink of destruction!

Su Yu spoke gravely, "It's too difficult! As hard as ascending to the heavens! Do you even know how long this river is? Do you have to reach its end to succeed, or is it enough to extend it a certain distance? You'll die! You were once the hardest to kill in the Myriad Realms, but now you're going to kill yourself!"

Once more, a Blue Sky appeared, giggling, "Little Brother Su Yu, you don't understand. This is about pursuing my true self! My heart is too loving; I love all beings, and they love me..."

Su Yu was helpless.

Boom!

Another explosion, and the bloodline extended further.

Blue Sky continued forward, one after another appearing, holding the Hunting Heaven List, avoiding the river's assault, and stepping further into the distance.

Su Yu followed, as did Wan Tiansheng.

After a while, Wan Tiansheng shouted, "Let me help you. I'll pave the way for you. Speed up! At this rate, even with countless clones, you'll be doomed!"

With that, he flew to the front of Blue Sky.

His physical body traversed the river, suppressing the waves crashing down!

Behind him, Blue Sky laughed, "Tiansheng is still so adorable. I'll keep going then!"

His speed increased significantly.

Previously, a clone would explode after three steps. Now, it took five, ten steps before they shattered.

Behind them, Su Yu took a deep breath, producing a small stone in his hand.

This was the treasure of suppression!

Of course, Su Yu had used it many times before, feeling its consumption was significant.

In the next moment, Su Yu summoned a large seal, his own Human Lord Seal, and said solemnly, "Principal Wan, use my Human Lord Seal to suppress it. The consumption is too great; come back!"

Wan Tiansheng caught the Human Lord Seal thrown by Su Yu, his aura erupting as he quickly suppressed the increasingly fierce waves!

Even with the Hunting Heaven List, the River of Time seemed to sense something.

Waves continued to crash down!

Trying to destroy Blue Sky.

Ahead, Wan Tiansheng struggled to shield Blue Sky from the storm, suppressing the giant waves.

Step by step, one Blue Sky after another exploded.

...

At this moment, in the Myriad Realms.

Everyone looked up at the sky, seeing a bloodline emerging from the Human Realm.

Yes, they couldn't see the River of Time, but they could see a bloodline starting from the Human Realm, extending outward step by step, causing tremors with each extension.

The speed of extension was slow, yet it seemed fast.

At this moment, the bloodline spread across the heavens, instilling fear among the myriad races.

In the East Rift Valley.

The Great Zhou King’s eyes flickered. Damn it!

In this era, one Su Yu wasn't enough; now there was Wan Tiansheng, and then Blue Sky. Is this a sign?

Just like in the era of the Human Emperor, where one Human Emperor wasn't enough, and then a multitude of powerful figures emerged.

The Culture King, Martial King, Control King, Radiant King...

"A new era is about to begin!"

A whisper, this era is about to officially begin!

The first year of the New Yu Era!

But... this blood color carries an ominous sign!

Is Blue Sky opening a path?

It feels... this path, like the blood color, is filled with danger, filled with killing intent. Can Blue Sky succeed?

They were just discussing whether to give the Hunting Heaven List to Blue Sky, and in the blink of an eye, Blue Sky took it himself.

What does Su Yu think?

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was also a bit dazed, as if he thought of someone, the Human Emperor!

Everyone says Su Yu is like the Culture King... nonsense, he's more like the Human Emperor!

The Human Emperor too.

In that era, the Culture King, Martial King, and others dominated the heavens, and the myriad races only knew the Four Extremes Human Kings, rarely mentioning the Human Emperor because he was too low-key. But low-key doesn't mean weak, doesn't mean inferior.

If the Human Emperor had no skills, would he still be called the Human Emperor?

The Human Emperor knew how to use people well. The Culture King, Martial King, Control King, Radiant King—who dared to disobey?

The Human Emperor was the key to the human race's dominance over the heavens, the key to the human race's survival for ten thousand years.

Generation after generation, the legacy continues to this day. The Four Extremes Human Kings left little behind, but the Human Emperor's legacy spans ancient and modern times!

And now, Su Yu too.

He achieved Wan Tiansheng, and now he's achieving Blue Sky. Before this, he also achieved the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, giving up the Ink Dao.

Also, is the Ink Dao in Liu Hong's hands?

With Su Yu's style, he might not care. Last time in the Death Realm, he vaguely sensed that Liu Hong had already proven the Dao. If Su Yu really wanted to capture Liu Hong, it would be too easy!

In the entire Death Realm, where could Liu Hong run?

Su Yu claims to be petty, but in the Great Zhou King's view, Su Yu is exceptionally charismatic, with a vision beyond imagination!

The Pen Dao doesn't seem as powerful as the path Blue Sky is taking.

The Ink Dao is also incredibly unique.

Even if Su Yu doesn't let the Desolate Beast's path out, he can cultivate it later, strengthening his physical body, fighting across the heavens!

"Vision... scope..."

The Great Zhou King looked at the sky, murmuring to himself. Perhaps this is why Su Yu can attract countless people to follow him.

At this moment, in the distance, human experts appeared one after another.

The Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, the Great Ming King...

These people all looked up at the sky, their expressions grave.

Even if they didn't know what was happening, the blood color was so dazzling, its spread causing fear and trepidation.

...

In the Immortal Realm.

Tiangu sat in the center of the grand hall, looking at the sky. Even above the Immortal Realm, without leaving the realm, one could vaguely see some blood color, a faint bloodline spreading across the sky.

Tiangu's expression was extremely grave!

"The human race, Su Yu, what is he doing again?"

The first thought was Su Yu. Who else could it be?

In the grand hall, many powerful figures were also uneasy and fearful. The Talisman King asked in a deep voice, "My lord, what is this bloodline?"

He didn't understand.

It actually spread to the Immortal Realm; this was too incredible!

Tiangu raised his head, also watching, silently observing for a long time before speaking in a low voice, "The bloodline... perhaps... is a path?"

"A path?"

Everyone was puzzled. What path?

Tiangu looked at the sky, slowly saying, "Is someone in the human race opening a path? Or what?"

Murmuring for a while, he sighed softly, "No need to worry about it. At this moment, the Human Realm has reached a peak, with geniuses emerging one after another! Be careful, the Upper Realm is closed, and the Human Realm is invincible! Su Yu said five years..."

Tiangu chuckled lightly, "Maybe three years, maybe two, maybe even sooner! He will launch an attack on us! He's gathering strength, waiting for the war with the Upper Realm to break out! Ten tides, Su Yu is the most like the Human Emperor!"

This was the highest praise.

The ancient Human Emperor!

The first ruler to unify the myriad races, and in 200,000 years, the only one.

The Talisman King and others changed color.

And Tiangu, after a long time, suddenly sighed, "Fuse the Dao! Jade King, Hanxiang, you all fuse the Dao!"

Below, a group of people was shocked.

Tiangu seemed to smile and cry, "All fuse the Dao! No need to hold back, no need to worry about me! Whether I can live to see the opening of the realm is uncertain! The Immortal Emperor's Great Dao... ultimately isn't my path! Hahaha, the human geniuses are opening paths, while I guard the path!"

He carried a hint of self-mockery, "I've fallen behind! I'm old, and I've lost some of the spirit of my youth. In my youth, I swept through my peers across the heavens! In my youth, at the end of the ancient era, I defeated the Culture King's student, narrowly won against the Martial King's descendant, strongly crushed the Radiant King's son, defeated the Control King's legacy, broke the Demon Emperor's descendant's formation, fought the God Emperor's son..."

Tiangu laughed, "That era belonged to me! Unfortunately... that era also didn't belong to me; I lost it myself!"

He mocked himself endlessly, "I was fooled by the Immortal Emperor. The old guy's path... may not be that strong; he might not even be dead!"

Tiangu, with his white hair, seemed both desolate and wistful.

Tiangu, a prodigy.

An unparalleled prodigy!

In the ancient times, Doubao once approached the Fate Emperor to ask if he could devour Tiangu. The Fate Emperor had said yes! Among the myriad realms, with so many delicacies and people, Doubao had asked about Tiangu, which already signified a lot.

After countless years of stagnation, focusing solely on the Immortal Emperor's path, Tiangu now found himself sealing off his realm in isolation, watching helplessly as the Human Race rose step by step. During the Tenth Tide, the Human Race erupted in power.

Tiangu sighed deeply, "Go and achieve Daofuse. There's no need to hide anymore, no need to endure! Buy some time for the Immortal Race, or else, before the Upper Realm even opens, the Immortal Race might be annihilated!"

He chuckled softly, then continued with a faint smile, "Perhaps, we might have to rely on you to ensure the survival of the Immortal Realm. If a great war truly erupts and the Immortal Race cannot rival the Human Race, we don't necessarily have to match them. For instance, if we can destroy the God and Demon Races, it wouldn't be impossible! Once those two races are wiped out, the gate to the Upper Realm will surely open!"

Everyone was shaken to their core!

Yet Tiangu continued in a somber tone, "Our race probably can't match the Human Race anymore! First, open the gate to the realms! The Death Realm has been silent for too long, perhaps something has happened there as well. Don't fantasize about waiting for the Upper Realm's gate to open on its own. That's impossible. By then, our race will be finished!"

The crowd felt a chill in their hearts.

Tiangu said no more, slowly disappearing from the grand hall, leaving behind a sense of regret, "In cultivation, one must forge ahead with courage. The Immortal Emperor misled me, and I, in turn, misled everyone. Those who merge their paths are destined to miss out on the wonders of the myriad realms!"

With an indescribable sense of melancholy, Tiangu vanished from the spot.

Many turned their gazes to the Symbol King, who frowned and after a long pause, said, "Regardless, if you can achieve Daofuse, then do it. Even if... it leads to death, it's still a better end than dying in the Eternal Realm!"

Upon hearing this, some of the ancient ones below exchanged glances. After a long time, Hanxiang said solemnly, "Then let's go into seclusion and achieve Daofuse!"

In the next moment, a group of elders also disappeared one by one.

They were determined to find a way to achieve Daofuse!

Tiangu had lifted the restrictions and no longer cared about them.

The Symbol King was right. If Tiangu were to target them later, it would still lead to death. Now, the situation looked dire. If the Human Race attacked, it might also lead to death!

So they decided to take a gamble!

...

Divine Realm.

In the Divine Emperor's Hall.

Jiwu was still cultivating when he suddenly opened his eyes, and soon, a phantom appeared before him.

"Former Empress..."

An old woman's voice slowly came, carrying a hint of weakness, "Select some geniuses. While I'm still alive, I'll instill some power of the great path into them. Let them achieve Daofuse as soon as possible."

"Former Empress, this..."

*Cough, cough, cough!*

The old woman coughed, "I'm almost at my end. I'm afraid I won't live to see our emperor return... Jiwu, you have great talent. I will... instill most of the power of the great path into you. Comprehend it well! Only by stepping into the quasi-king realm will you have a chance! If I die, preserve my remains... I wish... to see him one last time when he returns..."

With a sense of longing and reluctance, the old woman soon chuckled lightly, "The Human Race is rising again! The blood-red skies are not a good omen. Silly child, heal your wounds well. In a few days, I'll teach you the path. Survive... this era ultimately doesn't belong to us!"

"Former Empress!"

Jiwu stood up, but the old woman vanished instantly.

Jiwu's expression changed, filled with sorrow. The Former Empress was going to die.

Can our race not hold on?

How much strength has the Human Race accumulated?

"Why?"

Jiwu murmured, a promising situation was suddenly buried!

During the Ninth Tide, even though the Hundred Battle King was immensely powerful, the Former Empress never intervened, never questioned, never acted.

In this tide, the Human Race was incredibly weak, yet now, it forced the Former Empress to choose to give up, to give up her life, to give up waiting for the emperor's return.

"Jiwu... obey the order!"

With a sense of loss, Jiwu sat cross-legged, clearing his mind of distractions, letting go of everything.

I must comprehend the path!

Why hasn't the emperor returned?

The Former Empress won't get to see you one last time!

...

Devil Realm.

"Father..."

Moyue looked at Mojie, who was staring blankly at the sky. After a while, Mojie turned to Moyue, smiling after a long pause, "You have good talent, but you were born too late and have walked the Three Body Method to achieve Daofuse! During the Ninth Tide, we achieved a great victory, and I thought the Human Race was about to be wiped out. But reality proved me wrong."

He chuckled, suddenly patting Moyue's head, "You're not enough; your talent is still lacking! Go find Modona. I want to explain the Devil Race's path to him, tell him that the race ultimately surpasses everything!"

Mojie chuckled lightly, "Also, if things become impossible, escape into the Death Realm, be cautious! Back then, when I ventured into the Death Realm, I met a few sealed individuals in the Land of the Abyss. Just tell them you're my son! There, a certain Dizhi Luo, a senior of our race, has returned to his original mind. Though he's a necromancer, he can still look after you a bit..."

"Father!"

Moyue was heavy-hearted, "Is it because of this blood-red path?"

"No!"

Mojie shook his head, "That's just one aspect, not necessarily indicative of anything, but anomalies are frequent! These are unprecedented, all signs. In the past, when the Human Race unified the myriad realms, it was the same, with anomalies everywhere!"

Mojie chuckled, "Leave a way out! Besides, whether it's Tiangu or Jiwu, they're all old foxes. The God Race still has that ancient one, who has experienced the ancient unification of the myriad realms!"

He laughed, "They might also sense the crisis! If Su Yu launches a campaign across the myriad realms before the Upper Realm opens, our race might be in the greatest danger!"

Mojie grew more solemn, "With Tiangu and the Former Empress, these two races have deeper foundations than ours! If things become impossible, these guys might use the Devil Race as a sacrifice to forcibly open the gate to the Upper Realm! Back then, when you and Bloodfire competed for the position of Devil Emperor, I chose you not just because you're my son, but more importantly, because Bloodfire is too reckless, too straightforward, too simple!"

He sighed, "Bloodfire is good at fighting, but not at scheming! He can't outwit Tiangu and Jiwu! Even you fall short... alas!"

With a sigh, Moyue was deeply shaken, "Father means that if the Immortals and Gods face a crisis, they might target our Devil Race?"

"Why not?"

Mojie chuckled, "If they can't defeat the Human Race, can they not defeat our Devil Race? Is it better to fight the Human Race or to destroy our Devil Race and forcibly open the Upper Realm?"

"This..."

"Don't overthink it, focus on cultivating!"

Mojie looked at the sky, the blood-red still spreading, feeling a bit bitter, "If this blood path breaks, maybe all races will have a chance. If it doesn't... it means the Human Race is up to something again!"

Moyue said nothing, also looking at the sky, hoping this blood path would break soon!

...

At this moment, within the River of Time.

One after another, Blue Sky avatars shattered, and new ones appeared, holding the Hunting Heaven List, continuing forward, with a blood path trailing behind.

Ahead, Wan Tiansheng roared, the Human Lord Seal dimmed, and Wan Tiansheng was severely injured. At this moment, he shouted angrily, "Give up! Retreat! Blue Sky!"

Five or six thousand avatars had died!

It seemed endless!

At this rate, Blue Sky would completely perish, and the one known as undying would also die.

At this moment, despite countless avatars perishing, Blue Sky's eyes were exceptionally clear, with a hint of a smile, continuing forward, "No, you retreat! I know this path is hard to open, ten deaths and no life, but... I want to walk it! Maybe someone in ancient times walked it too, but they failed... I want to try again, I like challenging the limits!"

He smiled, revealing a grin, "Tiansheng, step aside, this path, I'll open it myself!"

Boom!

An avatar exploded again, and another appeared.

Wan Tiansheng was extremely solemn, roaring, no longer refined, slapping a wave into oblivion, spitting blood, and looking back at Su Yu.

Behind Blue Sky, Su Yu stood still.

Blue Sky took a step forward, and Su Yu took a step forward, not looking at Wan Tiansheng.

Blue Sky, this madman, wanted to carve his path into the mainstream of the River of Time!

Not a tributary, he wanted to carve his path, the Path of All Beings, into this main stream!

This was something Su Yu had thought about but never dared to do.

Today, this lunatic Blue Sky was doing it.

The Path of All Beings!

All beings have a source, the source of the great path lies in the River of Time. Instead of slowly comprehending the myriad races' paths, it's better to carve a path of one's own in this mainstream, using avatar flesh and blood as the foundation!

Carve a path and walk it!

This was Blue Sky, the mad Blue Sky.

How long must he carve to stabilize this path?

Unknown!

How long must he carve to succeed?

Unknown!

How long must he carve to complete it?

Also unknown!

The great path lay ahead, yet the future was uncertain, with no hope in sight. It was this hopeless path that Blue Sky was persistently carving.

He wanted to become a unique Blue Sky!

To hear the path in the morning and die in the evening.

At this moment, Blue Sky pushed his heart of exploration and pursuit of the path to the extreme.

In his life, his true nature never changed.

No matter how his appearance changed, he was always that Blue Sky, the Blue Sky who never ceased to explore.

Just like back then, when he resolutely left the Cultural Research Academy, bearing infamy, becoming the leader of the Sacred Cult, he was inherently mad.

"Sanghai Cangtian, spring returns to autumn, heaven and earth do not rest!"

"The great path does not leave the square inch, meticulous work has its practice..."

At this moment, Blue Sky's avatar appeared again, singing loudly.

The great path is beneath my feet!

If this path doesn't open, what path will I walk in this life?

Walk the path of avatars?

Mundane!

Only ordinary people walk that path of avatars. I am Blue Sky, the world celebrates for me, the great path sings for me!

Blue Sky beamed with a smile, singing loudly as he moved forward, avatars exploding, flesh and blood flying.

The blood path continued to extend!

Ahead, Wan Tiansheng roared madly, suppressing the giant waves.

It's too hard to find a confidant in life!

In this world, who isn't a madman?

I am, he is.

He couldn't bear it, didn't want it, and didn't want this madman to perish in this great path.

"Where is the path ahead?"

For the first time, Wan Tiansheng felt so desperate. How far must this path be carved?

When will it end!

He was almost at his limit.

From behind, Su Yu silently observed, following along without a word. 

Where does the path ahead lie? I do not know. I take it one step at a time, offering no advice, only feeling a bit envious, a bit self-mocking. I still have too many concerns. However... I have my own path, no need to envy others.

Still, life is better with a few confidants, isn't it? Happiness.

"Principal Wan, I wish you all the best!"

"..."

Damn!

At that moment, Wan Tiansheng spat out a mouthful of old blood.

Su Yu, you scoundrel, are you joking at a time like this? Are you trying to infuriate us to death?

Yet Su Yu burst into laughter. In the next moment, he held a massive stone, soared into the sky, and shouted, "Step aside and watch as I, Emperor Yu, stabilize the heavens and earth!"

Boom!

The stone crashed down, causing the River of Time to ripple, but the massive waves ahead were instantly calmed!

Su Yu's aura surged as he laughed heartily.

Wan Tiansheng can't do it!

A prodigy? 

Is there anyone more prodigious than me?

Powerful?

Is there anyone more powerful than me?

I, Su Yu, am the one to establish dominance over the myriad realms. Do you take me for a sick cat just because the tiger hasn't shown its might?

With unrestrained laughter, Su Yu shouted, "Move it, what are you standing there for? Today, I'm here to protect your path, so serve me well!"

Laughing loudly, Su Yu charged forward, wielding the massive stone. Wherever he went, no matter how large the waves, they were swiftly subdued!

Wan Tiansheng was left dumbfounded!

Lan Tian was momentarily stunned, then overjoyed, laughing heartily as he quickly followed. His clone pursued for a long time before finally exploding. The next Lan Tian transformed into a little girl, beaming with joy, "Emperor Yu is still the best. Brother Tiansheng, I'm going to switch my affections!"

Pfft!

Wan Tiansheng spat out another mouthful of old blood. Already severely injured, he nearly burst a lung from anger.

What nonsense!

These lunatics, alright, I suppose I count as one too. Three lunatics paving the way?

Wan Tiansheng thought, then suddenly smiled, revealing a grin as he swiftly began to heal his wounds.

My path is not solitary!
