Chapter 727: The Ninth Layer's Harvest

Pushing the door open was not difficult. However, the moment Su Yu stepped through, he froze.

The Great Zhou King and others were busy exchanging items, but they too looked up, eager to see what lay beyond. When the door swung open, everyone was stunned.

Ruins.

Yes, a wasteland.

The once-glorious Human Emperor Palace was now a desolate ruin, filled with shattered stones and broken paths of laws. The others might not have noticed, but Su Yu saw it clearly.

He saw the broken paths of laws!

He saw the chaotic mess, like a tangled ball of thread, intertwined and disorderly.

Corpses!

Su Yu even saw corpses.

A demon god, as lifelike as a living person, was pinned to a wall by a long spear, eyes wide open in anger.

The powerful aura emanating from it shook the surroundings.

Su Yu's expression shifted slightly.

He quickly surveyed the area!

Everywhere bore the marks of a great battle.

The Marquis Tongtian had said that the ninth layer was peaceful, without a single disturbance—what nonsense!

Perhaps he hadn't sensed it, or maybe he had been asleep at the time.

The entire ninth layer had been turned into a barren wasteland.

Su Yu soared into the sky, taking in the scene, and fell into a daze.

The entire ninth layer was reduced to just this one room!

Everything else was gone!

The magnificent Human Emperor Palace was gone, and it was said that the Culture King's Residence was within it, but that too was gone.

Nothing remained!

Only blood, corpses, and ruins.

The Great Zhou King and the others rushed out in a hurry.

At that moment, Marquis Huoyun ran towards the distance, ignoring the broken paths of laws and the murderous aura that filled the ninth layer.

He quickly reached a ruined hall.

There, a powerful figure clad in armor was suspended in the air, his head pierced through.

Marquis Huoyun rushed over, his body marked by the power of the broken paths, leaving trails of blood.

Yet, he paid no heed to these wounds.

He stared blankly at the powerful figure nailed in the void, and suddenly, tears streamed down his face as he knelt to the ground with a thud.

"My King!"

A cry of anguish echoed through the skies.

Marquis Huoyun wept like rain, kneeling and wailing, "My King, this subordinate is late!"

The once proud and fiery Marquis Huoyun now wept bitterly, as if abandoned, crying out in grief.

Even though he had been prepared, even though he had long accepted that those ancient beings were no more, today, he saw his benefactor!

Today, he saw his king, nailed to death before the Human Emperor Palace!

Su Yu's expression also changed slightly as he looked towards the void where the powerful being was nailed.

The face was youthful, as if alive.

The aura was immensely powerful, with a rebellious look on his face, a trait that Marquis Huoyun seemed to have learned from him.

Clad in golden armor, the body was scarred and battered.

Yet, it could not hide the domineering and powerful aura.

His long hair fluttered, his body bathed in blood.

This was a warrior who had fought to the last moment.

Above his head, one could vaguely sense the fluctuations of the River of Time.

In an instant, Su Yu understood!

This was a warrior who had stayed behind, or rather, a warrior responsible for blocking the retreat.

At this moment, Su Yu could vaguely imagine the final scene of that battle.

The great battle erupted, the Human Emperor forcibly expelled those masters of laws, entering the River of Time, sealing off other areas, leaving only this place open, where dozens of Human Kings fought fiercely in the ninth layer.

Some powerful beings chose to block the exit, or perhaps to stay behind in the Myriad Realms.

In the end, the masters of laws from the myriad races were too many, and they fought to the death here, all perishing in battle.

The entire ninth layer was silent, save for Marquis Huoyun's cries.

This was his benefactor!

As for the Hundred Battle King, he was merely a powerful figure they had supported.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King also wore a complex expression and transmitted to Su Yu, "That is King Yue. Before the Human Emperor unified the heavens, King Yue was a dominant figure, later subdued by the Culture King and pledged allegiance to the Human Emperor. He once followed the Human Emperor, the Culture King, and the Martial King, conquering the heavens. He alone suppressed the Three-headed Demon Wolf Realm, the Soul Realm, and many other great realms!"

"Marquis Huoyun was a general under King Yue, a warrior subdued by King Yue before he pledged allegiance to the Human Emperor."

"In ancient times, it was essentially a feudal system. Marquis Huoyun's lord was only King Yue. King Yue obeyed the orders of the imperial court, and only then was Marquis Huoyun considered part of the imperial court. Once King Yue left, Marquis Huoyun and his household troops would also leave... so King Yue was his benefactor..."

The Great Zhou King's expression was extremely complex.

Such a powerful being had died here, unknown to all, his corpse hanging for a hundred thousand years!

"My King... this subordinate... is incompetent!"

Marquis Huoyun wept, raising his head, kneeling on the ground, inching forward step by step, wanting to collect his benefactor's remains.

A hundred thousand years ago, King Yue and the others disappeared.

At that time, everyone said they were dead, they mourned, they grieved, but without seeing it, there was always a glimmer of hope.

Today, witnessing his benefactor's death here, his body left uncollected for a hundred thousand years, Marquis Huoyun was in immense pain.

At this time, the other ancient marquises were also looking around, with some trepidation, some fear, as if they didn't want to see something, afraid of seeing something.

In ancient times, it was mostly like this.

Each powerful being commanded a region.

They only knew who their benefactor was, the imperial power was still beneath their benefactor.

Hongmeng was under King Gong, Marquis Dingjun under King Ping, Marquis Lanshan under the Martial King...

These people all had their own benefactors.

At this moment, these people were anxious, uneasy, with some fear, even after a hundred thousand years had passed, and rumors said the Human Emperor and others had long died, there was still a glimmer of hope in their hearts.

If they saw the corpses... they could not accept it.

In their eyes, those invincible beings, how could they die in battle?

But King Yue's corpse was right there!

And at this moment, Su Yu suddenly stepped forward, blocking Marquis Huoyun, who immediately became furious, his eyes blood-red, "What are you doing?"

Killing intent surged!

What are you doing?

A corpse of a master of laws could be used for many things.

Marquis Huoyun's spear appeared instantly, furious beyond measure, glaring at Su Yu with a heart full of determination, eyes filled with rage!

The entire person was like a volcano about to erupt, any slight movement could lead to a great battle!

At this moment, countless avatars of Lantian appeared, frowning at him.

Su Yu waved his hand, looking at Marquis Huoyun, speaking calmly, "Do not approach. King Yue died in battle, his aura contained, with a breath of killing intent in his chest! If you approach and touch the corpse, you will surely die!"

Marquis Huoyun hesitated, half-believing, half-doubting.

Su Yu no longer paid him any mind, turning to look at King Yue nailed in the void, then at the distant wall where the first corpse he saw was hanging, speaking softly, "King Yue, in his final moment, killed this guy, but was heavily injured, his path shattered, and he himself fell here."

The other corpses were not visible, mostly just bloodstains or some remnants.

But King Yue and that demon god's corpses were well-preserved.

Su Yu looked at King Yue's remains, having already traced back the final battle, the last scene.

King Yue blocked the retreat, this demon god might have been trying to escape from the River of Time, the Human Emperor and others had already fought upstream, King Yue blocked the path, perhaps more than one tried to break through, others might have been killed or forced back.

That demon god charged down, and the heavily injured King Yue ultimately forced himself to kill this demon god who had escaped the River of Time.

But he himself also died here, unable to catch up with the main force, unable to stay in the Myriad Realms.

Only his corpse hung high in the air, still guarding that entrance.

Su Yu sighed softly, bowing slightly.

The last battle of ancient times, these people were still admirable.

For the safety of the human race, to continue suppressing the myriad races, the Human Emperor took less than half the enemy's masters of laws, taking away all the masters of laws from the Myriad Realms, including many top marquises.

Of the 720 ancient marquises of the myriad races, less than a third remained in the end.

Similarly, there were human marquises who followed and left.

A large number of masters of laws, top Daofuse cultivators, all followed the Human Emperor and left.

At this moment, countless thoughts surfaced, and Su Yu bowed in respect.

Not for anything else, just out of respect for these ancient times, knowing they would die, yet still unwavering, domineering and peerless, continuing to suppress the top powerhouses of the myriad races.

"Do not disturb King Yue!"

Su Yu said softly, "I told you, he still has a breath of killing intent stored within, still dutifully waiting to deliver a fatal blow to any who might escape!"

King Yue was dead!

But his path was broken, all the laws contained within him, equivalent to swallowing all the power of the path at the last moment, stored within his body.

If a strong being from the myriad races were to walk out of the passage, they would likely not escape his earth-shattering strike!

A final strike from a top Human King!

This strike was not something Marquis Huoyun could withstand, nor could Su Yu.

Marquis Huoyun's expression changed, and the Great Zhou King quickly approached, bowing to King Yue's remains, looking at Marquis Huoyun, sighing, "Trust Emperor Yu, he has no reason to deceive you! King Yue died here, unwilling to let the enemy walk out of the river and harm the human race... The king was loyal and righteous, you, as his subordinate, should not tarnish his final honor."

Marquis Huoyun's violent aura gradually calmed down.

At this moment, Marquis Yunshui and others also approached, all bowing to King Yue's remains, their expressions complex.

General Yingwu didn't know what to say, but still offered some comfort, "We... we should not disturb King Yue! Lord Yue might... might be waiting for the Human Emperor and others to return..."

Marquis Huoyun's expression was complex, eyes filled with sorrow, "My King... lying here for a hundred thousand years, I thought... thought he..."

At this moment, he didn't know what to say.

The original intention was to prepare the body of King Yue for burial, but Su Yu and his companions advised against moving him at this time. The king had left behind one final strike, and thus, Marquis Huoyun had to abandon the idea. He gazed at the remains of King Yue, his sorrow deepening.

He had fallen!

This was the only known Human King to have perished. Others were merely missing, which left a sliver of hope, however faint, that they might still be alive. But for King Yue, there was no hope left.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King spoke in a deep voice, "Emperor Yu, King Yue has been dead for so many years. Is it possible for him to... to revive in the Death Realm?"

Upon hearing this, Marquis Huoyun's eyes lit up with hope.

Su Yu shook his head. "There are two possibilities. First, he might be dormant in the Celestial River of Death, unable to revive because his power and dao are insufficient to awaken a ruler of laws. Second, for an existence of his level, the Death Path might not be able to guide him."

Marquis Huoyun's eyes dimmed again.

Su Yu continued, "If it's the first case, revival isn't entirely impossible. If some powerful beings in the Death Realm are killed, enough to birth a ruler of laws, then there might be hope."

Marquis Huoyun clung to this thread of hope, asking eagerly, "Emperor Yu, does my king still have a chance to revive?"

Su Yu replied calmly, "I can't promise you anything. I'm just saying it's possible."

He didn't want to shatter Marquis Huoyun's last hope, but the chances were slim. Could the Death Path really guide away someone of such a level who had died in battle? Not necessarily. Strictly speaking, the Death Path is also a path, an existence on par with a ruler of laws. Could it guide away a strong individual of the same level?

Su Yu decided not to dwell on it further. He would leave a glimmer of hope for Marquis Huoyun.

He looked at King Yue's body with a sense of regret and reflection. Today, he had seen the first corpse of a Human King who had died in battle. Back then, the departure of the Human Emperor and others wasn't as easy as imagined. After all, with so many rulers of laws among the myriad races, and with powerful beings like the Immortal Emperor, who were not necessarily weaker than the Martial King, how could they willingly leave the Myriad Realms with the Human Emperor?

They could only fight their way through, forcing the powerful of the myriad races to retreat, battling for countless years. Here lay the bodies of two rulers of laws. But it wasn't just these two. Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened, and his eyes were filled with tears of blood as he saw the broken paths of laws permeating the void.

He didn't say it out loud, but... more than two rulers of laws had died here! Definitely more! This place was filled with mixed paths of laws, all immensely powerful. Perhaps several paths had completely collapsed, not just those of King Yue and that demon god.

Su Yu suddenly asked, "The Demon Race, do they have more than one ruler of laws?"

The Great Zhou King replied solemnly, "More than one! The Human Race had as many as 41 rulers of laws. How could the Demon Race have only one? Even the Iron Devourer Race has more than one; January is a ruler of laws, and so is February!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. "So, the rulers of laws among the myriad races are not limited to 99?"

The Great Zhou King nodded. "Some ancient marquises of the myriad races possess the strength of rulers of laws! However, they cannot be crowned as kings. Being crowned as a king is exclusive to the Human Race."

The Great Zhou King added, "Although there are more than 99, the Human Race also had allies back then... so the Human Race had more rulers of laws than just those."

Su Yu nodded slightly, surveying the surroundings. The entire ninth floor was in ruins, except for a small house that still stood. It was the same house they had just flown out of. Amidst the battles of countless powerful beings, it had managed to remain intact. This was no accident. Su Yu suddenly produced a diagram—the Dao Diagram.

Looking at the small house again, Su Yu pondered and said softly, "This house bears the heaviest imprint of the Human Emperor's dao and is one of the entrances to the Upper Realm. Its defenses are extremely strong, and even the power of laws cannot destroy it... so it has been preserved."

So many powerful beings had fought here, yet this house had survived. That was already quite remarkable.

Having said that, Su Yu no longer looked at King Yue's body. This war god-like figure was still waiting for his comrades to return.

Su Yu turned his gaze to the demon god he had nailed to the wall. After watching for a while, he said softly, "This is also a ruler of laws, but it seems not as strong as the Human King!"

Marquis Huoyun glared angrily, "Emperor Yu, I want to shatter his corpse, drain his blood, and peel his skin!"

King Yue had unleashed a deadly strike because this guy had fled, leading to the collapse of his dao. This was the culprit responsible for King Yue's death!

Su Yu said softly, "It's not impossible, but... let's make use of this waste! A demon god at the level of a ruler of laws, I've only seen one other ruler of laws' corpse, the Desolate Beast's corpse, which transformed the bloodlines of the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, allowing them to quickly gain top-tier combat strength..."

The crowd looked at him, and the Great Zhou King hesitated slightly, "Emperor Yu, do you mean for someone to switch to his dao?"

"No, his dao is shattered and can't be switched to."

Su Yu shook his head. "I just want to use it. A ruler of laws... is a great treasure. My Mark of Civilization, the demon race page, might finally be perfected!"

Su Yu smiled, "I might not need to spend any more time on the demon race's dao!"

With such a powerful existence nurturing the demon dao's power, even a pseudo-dao could quickly be perfected!

After speaking, Su Yu quickly stepped forward, looking at the corpse. At this moment, the corpse was nailed to the wall by a long spear, which should have been King Yue's weapon.

Su Yu's Heaven Gate opened, and he frowned slightly as the power of the dao fluctuated. As soon as it fluctuated, the long spear nailed to the opponent's forehead instantly turned to dust.

Marquis Huoyun panicked, but Su Yu said solemnly, "Don't look at me. The spear had long been exhausted of all its divine charm by King Yue. It was just an empty shell. Now that I'm moving this corpse, the weapon will inevitably disappear!"

Marquis Huoyun was somewhat helpless, with a hint of sadness. "My king loved this Yue Dragon Spear the most. It was crafted from the dragon bones of a top-tier dragon expert he killed..."

Su Yu said nothing. The ancient Human Race wasn't exactly benevolent, at least not from the perspective of the myriad races. Su Yu never believed there was a clear distinction between good and evil in this world; it was all about different standpoints. The Human Race found the myriad races detestable, and vice versa.

Consider this: crafting a spear from a dragon's bones—does that make one a good person? Clearly not! But this King Yue, who died here, remained loyal to his duty even in death, guarding that entrance, preventing the myriad races from escaping, hanging his body for ten thousand years just for that final strike. From the Human Race's standpoint, he was a great hero!

An enemy to them, a hero to us.

Without saying much, Su Yu looked again at the demon god. The long spear had turned to dust, yet the corpse remained suspended there. The aura was still contained within!

Very powerful!

Ordinary people would be courting death by touching this corpse.

However, Su Yu was not afraid. If he truly wanted to move King Yue's body, he could, but he chose not to. Since King Yue wanted to stand guard for one last shift, Su Yu would let him.

As for this demon god... there was no need to worry about him!

In Su Yu's hand, an imprint appeared—the Xingyu Imprint. With one imprint, the violent aura instantly calmed down. Su Yu's eyes flickered, and the Mark of Civilization appeared, somewhat damaged, with the book cover missing. At this moment, one of its pages, the one belonging to the demon race, was already quite powerful.

With a flick of Su Yu's hand, a shadow of a demon race, roughly at the second stage of the Eternal Realm, appeared and began to devour the corpse.

However, the opponent was too strong!

The demon race shadow was somewhat apprehensive, and forcibly devouring it showed signs of being unable to digest it.

Everyone watched silently.

Su Yu frowned slightly.

Suddenly, the Dao Diagram he had just collected appeared.

The Dao Diagram, at this moment, rotated in black and white, like the alternation of day and night.

"My Mark of Civilization's book cover is broken... this is my weapon for proving the dao. An ordinary book cover can no longer meet my needs..."

Su Yu looked at the Xingyu Imprint. "Today, I wish to use this Dao Diagram to reforge the book cover. I hope the Human Emperor will forgive me!"

Everyone was shocked!

Using the Dao Diagram to forge a book cover!

What a grand gesture.

"The Human Emperor's interpretation of the dao forged the Dao Diagram, and my dao also seeks to open the heavens, to merge all paths, to become the fourth person to open the heavens! This diagram is perfect for forging the book cover of my Mark of Civilization!"

Su Yu didn't know if he was speaking to himself, to others, to the Human Emperor, or if he was making a vow to himself!

I want to open the heavens and prove the dao!

To be the fourth person to open the heavens and prove the dao!

The Mark of Civilization was already very strong, having even suppressed a Heavenly King before, but it was still not strong enough!

Su Yu needed to be stronger!

His opponents were growing stronger.

Even a Celestial had appeared, and he might soon encounter a true ruler of laws. His Mark of Civilization was not weak, but it could only handle minor tasks. For example, the demon race page was considered strong, but the shadow it produced was only at the initial stage of the Eternal Realm.

Such a shadow would be easily killed by a top-tier expert!

Back when it was first forged, with 300 Sunmoon pages, Su Yu thought it was terrifyingly strong. Now, he had forged over 2000 pages, almost all at the Sunmoon Realm, with some already possessing Eternal strength.

But now, it was still incredibly weak, unable to match strong enemies.

Su Yu had spent countless resources on the Mark of Civilization.

To make it a weapon for opening the heavens and proving the dao, it couldn't be mediocre.

As he spoke, Su Yu's power of the dao manifested, and a hammer suddenly appeared in his hand. The Dao Diagram automatically fell onto the Mark of Civilization.

At this moment, one divine character after another appeared.

Universe Civilization!

Four large characters fell into the diagram.

Su Yu struck down with the hammer, and the sound of hammering instantly echoed through the silent ninth floor!

At this moment, Su Yu felt that this Dao Diagram was simply perfect as a book cover!

Moreover, it was truly beautiful.

The alternation of black and white, like the cycle of day and night, contained the profound truths of the Human Emperor's interpretation of the myriad paths. Whether it was the Human Emperor, Su Yu, or the Time Sage, they all sought the convergence of all paths, fundamentally consistent.

This could also fill some of Su Yu's gaps and nurture those four divine characters.

King Yue had died in battle, and the Human Emperor had left with his people, making Su Yu feel that the Human Emperor's situation might not be good!

If it were good, King Yue wouldn't have died here.

The number of living rulers of laws who were taken away remains uncertain.

"Clang!"

A crisp sound echoed throughout the ninth floor!

He intended to reforge the book's cover, devouring the corpse of this ruler of laws. Once completed, the demon race page would be perfected, and its shadow might even reach Daofuse Realm combat strength. This meant that when Su Yu wielded his weapon, the Mark of Civilization, he could match or even kill a Daofuse Realm expert!

Moreover, Su Yu had previously collected many corpses and blood essence without devouring them. Once the book cover was reforged, the Mark of Civilization would be upgraded again, allowing him to absorb and digest these resources.

...

"Clang!"

On the eighth floor.

Marquis Tongtian's heart trembled. This... was the sound coming from the ninth floor?

How could that be possible?

Wasn't the ninth floor supposed to be empty?

How could there be any sound?

Marquis Tongtian transformed into his human form, looking towards the distant sky above the council hall, where the entrance to the ninth floor was located. However, with the rules in chaos and extreme danger, he dared not approach.

After a moment of hesitation, Marquis Tongtian vanished instantly.

...

Soon, on the seventh floor.

Marquis Tongtian shouted, "Martial Emperor, come out!"

"Did you hear that sound?"

The void fluctuated, and the Martial Emperor, previously invisible to outsiders, now condensed into a corporeal form visible to others. He exuded a sense of grievance, dominance, and arrogance as he coldly looked at Marquis Tongtian.

However, Marquis Tongtian couldn't care less, nervously asking, "There's a sound on the eighth floor. Is there one here too? Did you hear it? Martial Emperor, it's just the two of us alive here. How could there be a sound? Could it be... could it be that the Human Emperor and the others have returned?"

"Clang!"

"Yes, that's the sound!"

Marquis Tongtian was shocked, "That's the sound! Did you hear it?"

The Martial Emperor frowned slightly, now hearing it as well.

He had initially thought Marquis Tongtian was spouting nonsense, but now he grew serious.

Had the Human Emperor and the others returned?

If they had returned, what would become of him?

He frowned deeply, as the sound, rhythmic and resonant, continued to echo. According to Marquis Tongtian, it came from the ninth floor.

The Luminous Domain Mansion, from the first to the seventh floor, was constructed from the Martial Emperor's own body.

As for the eighth and ninth floors, they were forged separately.

Though the Martial Emperor was powerful, his body was not enough to accommodate hundreds of rulers of laws, so the eighth and ninth floors were created later.

At this moment, the rhythmic forging sound continued to resonate.

The Martial Emperor looked up at the sky, a serious expression on his face.

Could it really be the Human Emperor and the others returning?

Impossible!

Beside him, Marquis Tongtian nervously asked, "Martial Emperor, could it be the Human Emperor and the others returning? If they have returned, I've pledged allegiance to Emperor Yu. Does that count as betrayal? It shouldn't, right? And you, you're in trouble too!"

The Martial Emperor coldly stared at him.

Marquis Tongtian, courting death, said, "Really, you're definitely in trouble! I'm telling the truth. You've been clamoring to kill the current human race and eradicate the Human Emperor's legacy. You're definitely going to be killed!"

The Martial Emperor glared at him, annoyed, "So what if they return?"

"If they return, you're dead!"

Marquis Tongtian hurriedly said, "Aren't you afraid?"

The Martial Emperor wanted to kill this guy!

He slapped at him, but Marquis Tongtian vanished instantly, reappearing moments later, "Don't hit, don't hit! Let's talk this out. I'm just a gatekeeper. If you kill me, the eighth and ninth floors will collapse, and you'll die even faster."

The Martial Emperor coldly glanced at him, ignoring him, and continued to listen to the sound. After a while, he said in a deep voice, "It sounds like weapon forging!"

"Weapon forging?"

Marquis Tongtian was stunned, quickly saying, "What evidence do you have to say it's weapon forging? I think it might be the sound of a gong, or knocking on a door, or clinking glasses while drinking, or even kowtowing and begging for mercy..."

He kept talking, and the Martial Emperor's aura changed as he looked at him, coldly saying, "Tongtian, if you keep babbling, I'll kill you today!"

Too much nonsense!

Although he hadn't completely unsealed yet, his strength was gradually recovering, and the seal on his Great Dao was slowly being lifted. Killing Tongtian wasn't impossible now!

Marquis Tongtian was frustrated and stopped talking.

He felt helpless.

I was serious!

It could indeed be one of those things I mentioned.

You say it's weapon forging, but I think it might not be. You can't out-argue me, so you threaten me with force!

The Martial Emperor ignored him, continuing to listen.

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu continued forging.

The hammer struck repeatedly.

Again and again.

Integrating the Great Dao Book into the Mark of Civilization was no simple task.

Each strike was not just brute force like before but a strike with a path, infused with Su Yu's own understanding of the Great Dao.

The Great Dao Book represented the Human Emperor's understanding of myriad paths.

This Expanding Spirit Hammer, on the other hand, struck out Su Yu's understanding of myriad paths.

He had once wandered the River of Time, stolen the power of myriad paths, mastered myriad race techniques, and buried myriad race pages.

Su Yu himself had his own understanding and insights into the myriad paths.

One strike was like fire, another like wind, the next carried the power of space, and another embodied the path of vibration!

Through countless strikes!

As Su Yu's understanding of the Great Dao merged, the Great Dao Book gradually began to integrate into the Mark of Civilization, forming a black-and-white alternating book cover.

The Great Zhou King and others listened silently.

Gradually, they too gained some insights.

This time, they gained a lot.

Having just comprehended the Human Emperor's exposition of the Great Dao from the Great Dao Book, they quickly listened to Su Yu's understanding of the Great Dao.

Both the Human Emperor and Su Yu were peerless prodigies.

Su Yu's strength was far inferior to the Human Emperor, but his understanding of the Great Dao was not much worse than that of an average ruler of laws. More importantly, his knowledge was extensive, not limited to a single path.

The one who gained the most was actually Lantian.

His path was the Path of All Beings.

It was also a form of convergence of myriad paths!

Both the Human Emperor and Su Yu followed this type of path. At this moment, countless avatars of Lantian appeared, each sitting cross-legged, listening silently.

Lantian's understanding of the Great Dao was not low, but even so, he couldn't compare to someone like Su Yu, who had opened the Heaven Gate, essentially cheating.

Flames surged, and the Five Elemental Paths were struck out by Su Yu.

The Silent Path followed.

The Great Zhou King also pondered, feeling Su Yu's understanding of the Silent Path. Su Yu himself often used this path, and his accomplishments in it were not shallow.

Only the Great Ming King, after listening for a while, secretly grumbled.

Emperor Yu's understanding of formations was still too lacking.

There was some, but that bit of understanding was not even as good as the Great Ming King's own.

The Great Ming King felt powerless and gave up expecting anything.

Countless strikes.

Sweat continuously dripped from Su Yu's forehead.

The Great Dao Book and the Mark of Civilization merged more and more, with the essence of the Dao becoming apparent. At this moment, one look at the Mark of Civilization revealed it to be an unparalleled treasure!

No one knew how many times he struck, but with a loud boom!

The Mark of Civilization and the Great Dao Book became one!

At this moment, golden patterns spread!

Gradually, the patterns extended to 180!

With 180 golden patterns, by classification, it was already considered a peak divine weapon!

All the pages grew stronger.

The demon race page, originally with a shadow of about the second stage of the Eternal Realm, suddenly surged in aura, reaching the strength of four or five stages.

And this shadow took the opportunity to devour the corpse.

The previously motionless corpse began to lose power, and Su Yu continued to suppress it with the Luminous Domain Seal, sweat dripping from his forehead as the shadow devoured continuously.

Growing stronger!

The weak become strong!

This corpse, after all, was the body of a ruler of laws. Even after countless years of death, its blood essence hadn't leaked, only its power of laws had shattered.

The shadow's aura began to strengthen!

Eternal sixth stage!

It continued to devour.

After a while, the corpse's aura began to noticeably weaken, while the shadow's power grew.

Seventh stage!

The Great Zhou King and others were secretly shocked!

Su Yu's weapon of proving the Dao was terrifying.

The corpse's aura continued to weaken, its blood essence draining, and the demon race shadow's strength increased again, reaching the eighth stage!

At this moment, the shadow began to show signs of solidity!

A power of laws wrapped around its body.

This was essentially the embodiment of the Dao!

If Su Yu infused this shadow with some spiritual energy, allowing it to gain intelligence, it would be akin to the existence of Doubao.

Of course, at this moment, Su Yu wasn't interested in letting this Dao gain intelligence.

Moreover, this was just a pseudo-Dao.

It was a virtual Dao he had outlined!

Not a true Dao in the real sense, unless he succeeded in merging myriad paths to open a Dao, then these virtual Daos could all become real.

Ninth stage!

At this moment, the shadow's strength increased again!

The Dao wrapped around it became more solid.

Like a black dragon, it coiled around the shadow.

After an unknown amount of time, half of the corpse had been absorbed, and Su Yu shouted in a low voice, as waves of power of laws surged into the demon race page, power he had extracted from the Human Emperor's Great Dao!

Boom!

A loud explosion sounded.

"Roar!"

The shadow, like a primordial demon god, suddenly roared, the black Dao on its body rapidly solidifying, becoming incredibly powerful, and in the blink of an eye, its aura surged!

Boom!

The aura overflowed, and in an instant, the Great Zhou King and others were slightly discolored, Daofuse!

It had stepped into Daofuse!

Su Yu had actually nurtured a Daofuse spirit, no, not a spirit, just a weapon spirit, one of the pages' spirits.

When the shadow stepped into Daofuse, it solidified significantly, revealing some features, looking exactly like Su Yu, but full of demonic energy, appearing extremely cold.

Everyone stared for a while, unable to resist glancing at Su Yu.

This demonically charged Dao spirit seemed quite terrifying.

If Su Yu himself wore a cold expression, he would probably look like this.

Would Su Yu find this cold-faced demonic Su Yu unattractive?

Su Yu didn't think much of it. It was normal for his weapon of proving the Dao to manifest a shadow resembling himself. He had no time to ponder others' thoughts.

At this moment, the corpse of the ruler of laws had been mostly absorbed.

Su Yu didn't let up, continuing to absorb.

The demonic shadow devoured madly, its speed much faster than before.

Its aura began to grow stronger once more.

**Chapter 745:**

The corpse grew increasingly frail, its power being devoured by seventy, eighty percent... Boom! The aura of the demonic shadow transformed once more!

The Great Zhou King raised an eyebrow, glancing at Grandstar. Grandstar returned the look, transmitting his dissatisfaction, "Why are you looking at me? At most, I can reach the power of a fourth-tier Daofuse. Soon, I'll be at the third-tier... But this demonic shadow, it might be able to challenge Heavendoom. Truly terrifying!"

This was just one page, yet Su Yu intended to forge ten thousand pages!

Unimaginable!

Of course, the other pages probably wouldn't hold such formidable hope, considering this one had devoured the power of a ruler of laws.

Even if it was a deceased ruler of laws!

The corpse gradually began to dissipate.

Once the last bit of power was consumed, the corpse vanished completely, and the aura of the demonic shadow transformed once more, becoming immensely powerful!

Third-tier Daofuse power!

Su Yu frowned slightly, then quickly relaxed, "After all, it was a deceased ruler of laws, and the power of the Great Dao was severed. It could only barely create a demonic shadow that just stepped into the third-tier Daofuse realm... It's acceptable."

Not too bad!

At this moment, the entire Mark of Civilization was also filled with demonic energy.

However, as the demonic energy spread, it was absorbed by the book's cover forged from the Book of Time as soon as it reached it. The black and white rotated, mysterious beyond compare.

The demonic energy was suppressed!

"Congratulations, Emperor Yu!" the Great Zhou King congratulated. Su Yu's weapon of proving the Dao had become significantly stronger than before.

Su Yu smiled, "I've only completed one ten-thousandth of the forging. This thing is consuming more and more resources. I don't even know if there will ever be a day when it's fully nurtured."

Su Yu shook his head. Well, even if it doesn't reach Daofuse, it's fine. As long as the virtual Great Dao is presented, I can attempt to merge the myriad Daos and open a path.

After speaking, Su Yu laughed, "The ninth floor doesn't seem to have much left. Everyone, clean up the battlefield. Let's have King Yue guard this place... We'll go down and take a look!"

He was familiar with the eighth floor. Once he reached the eighth floor, he could go anywhere he wanted.

Everyone nodded in agreement. Several ancient marquises, including Marquis Huoyun, were somewhat reluctant, but there was nothing they could do. Staying here all day, staring at King Yue's corpse, only added to their sorrow.

Without saying much, everyone began to clean up the battlefield.

Some broken weapons, spilled blood, all became their targets for collection, including some treasures from the original Human Emperor's Palace. Taking them out now, they could be used as carriers.

Su Yu calculated the time. It had been almost two days since he came out.

He wondered what the situation in the Upper Realm was like now.

Xia Longwu and the others were all in the Upper Realm. He still needed to go up.

The ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion had yielded considerable gains. However, Su Yu glanced at the entrance above King Yue's head. Perhaps... that was the true core of the ninth floor!

The Human Emperor and the others likely entered the River of Time from there, traveling upstream to fight their way through.

If he entered there and traveled upstream, could he find the Human Emperor and the others?

Where were the Culture King and the others?

One thought after another flashed through Su Yu's mind.

He must quickly quell the threat of the Myriad Realms!

Otherwise, if those guys returned, who knew if the Human Emperor and the others were dead or alive? Perhaps the Myriad Races would achieve a great victory, and a few top-tier rulers of laws would appear. That would be troublesome!

The last two hours of October are here. If you don't cast your monthly votes, they'll go to waste. Please cast them, thank you!

**October Ends, Thank You All!**

October has ended, and it was another glorious month.

The monthly votes broke last month's record again, reaching 450,000 votes. Thank you all for your support!

Coincidentally, today, the Myriad Races surpassed six million words, with an average subscription of over 62,000. Along the way, we defeated High Martial, yes, everything is under control. As expected, this month we surpassed High Martial and broke the record for the fastest five-star masterpiece!

October brought too much glory. The Myriad Races became a five-star masterpiece, winning the monthly vote championship for the sixth time, achieving a six-time consecutive championship.

Additionally, I took two and a half days off this month and updated 830,000 words, breaking the update record of Old Eagle, with an average of nearly 30,000 words per day.

Also, this month, the Myriad Races gained the first billion alliance since Old Eagle started writing. Special thanks to the great support of the giant Sun and Moon in the pot!

The great one is mighty!

Also, this month, Seven Swords Opening Heaven became the third golden alliance master of the Myriad Races. Thank you, Seven Swords, for your great support!

Thanks to the Flying Pig of the Flying Family, this month, two silver alliances supported again!

Thanks to Yao Qiang, chzoney, Gen1us, and several others for their great support this month, all of whom are silver alliances. Thank you very much!

This month, there were too many alliance rewards. The alliance masters of the Myriad Races should exceed 700. The list of alliance masters is too long, and I really haven't had time to list them all recently. Updating every day has turned me into a dog. Thank you all for your strong support!

Additionally, I need to mention that the previous event about sending physical books has already shipped three batches this month. A total of over 200 readers have had their physical books sent out. There are still some left, and by the 10th of next month, they will all be sent out.

If you haven't received your book by the 15th and participated in the event, please confirm with the management whether you registered. Make sure all registered readers receive the beautiful signed book from Old Eagle. My signature is really handsome, no arguments!

Finally, thank you to all the brothers and sisters for your votes and subscriptions, once again breaking Old Eagle's record. Thank you very much!

A new month begins, November is coming soon. After midnight, everyone, please cast your guaranteed monthly votes. There will be no double monthly votes in November, so cast them on the first day and march towards the seventh consecutive championship!

Thank you all!

Requesting monthly votes, requesting monthly votes, requesting monthly votes, important things are said three times, thank you all!
