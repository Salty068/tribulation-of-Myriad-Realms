Chapter 834: The Past Self

At the age of six, there was actually a person, an incomparably powerful figure, who followed his father. 

Unfathomable! 

An existence of immense strength!

Su Yu set up a grand array, sealing everything off, and slowly drifted towards his home with a few others in tow. He faced away from his younger self, avoiding direct eye contact to prevent being discovered and disrupting his own memories.

Su Yu was somewhat familiar with this. In his memory, as long as he didn't look closely or investigate thoroughly, the other party, separated by sixteen years, would find it difficult to notice him.

He landed in his home, back turned to his younger self, his father, and that indistinct figure. At this moment, the house contained both Su Yu's group and the shadowy figure, along with Su Long.

Su Long was chatting with young Su Yu, seemingly in a great mood, laughing heartily, "We've struck it rich!"

"Dad, did you find money?"

"Something like that!"

Su Long chuckled, "Anyway, we've hit the jackpot! Son, take a look, but don't show anyone else... Look, this is something your dad picked up, a book! A golden book!"

"Do you know what a golden book is? In the past, only big shots dared to use them... Even now, selling it for gold would make us rich. I value it greatly, and I'm looking for a chance to sell it... That would be a huge profit!"

"But we must be careful, lest someone gets greedy, and that would be troublesome. Anyway, it's a treasure!"

"It's just that I can't open it. I don't know if it's made to look like a book or if I just can't open it... This thing might be some sort of cultivation treasure..."

Su Long rambled on, clearly in high spirits. Su Yu judged that perhaps his father really had picked it up by chance. However, Su Yu also sensed that the Book of Time was incredibly powerful, yet Su Long felt nothing. Perhaps... it was sealed by this shadow, blocking the Book of Time's aura.

The Book of Time didn't come without energy! 

It had energy, but it was sealed, which is why an ordinary person could pick it up.

"Why my father?" 

Su Yu wondered, what kind of existence was this shadow? 

Why did my father pick up the treasure? 

My father had no special qualities. Was this aimed at my father, or was it aimed at me? 

But even if it was aimed at me, I had no special qualities at that time, right?

One question after another surfaced in Su Yu's mind.

Was the Book of Time a legacy from the Time Sage, or was it forcibly given to me by this shadow, or something else?

The existence of this thing allowed Su Yu to accumulate enough initial capital. Otherwise, he wouldn't have reached his current level.

The shadow remained silent from beginning to end.

Soon, Su Long prepared a meal for his son.

Su Yu didn't look, but he could hear the sounds, and the scene naturally appeared in his mind, along with the image of the shadow always following his father.

In this situation, after finishing the meal, Su Long spoke again, "Ah Yu, stay at home, don't run around. I'm going out to find some opportunities, and when I come back, I'll get you a bigger house. Before I leave, I'll give Wu Ah San's dad a beating... Remember, don't run around!"

"Oh, got it."

"And that golden book, I'll leave it at home. Don't take it out to show off, or we'll lose the chance for a big house! If anyone comes, just say Dad's not home, and don't open the door..."

"Got it!"

"Good, then Dad's going out for a bit to see if I can contact Lord Xiahou. That fat guy has money... We don't know what this book is for, but if the fat guy takes a liking to it, we can trick him into thinking it's an invincible treasure, and he'll believe it! He's rich and gullible, and the Xia family usually doesn't do anything shady, so we're bound to get rich..."

Su Long continued to ramble, and Su Yu smiled.

His father was quite bold back then, planning to trade this item with Lord Xiahou?

If he succeeded, it would have nothing to do with him.

Soon, Su Long left.

Su Yu's expression changed slightly.

Su Long left, but the shadow... didn't!

This thing wasn't following Su Long; it came with the Book of Time.

Time Sage? 

Culture King?

This Book of Time was a treasure, so was this shadow the Culture King or the Time Sage?

Strange!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King and others were also surprised. It had nothing to do with Su Long. Was this person here for the Book of Time or for Su Yu?

"The recipe actually fell into the hands of a waste..."

At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded in Su Yu's ears, startling the South Heavenly King. The commotion was quite loud, and Su Yu hurriedly pressed her down, signaling her to remain silent.

"What a pity!"

The voice spoke again.

And at that moment, the shadow did something unknown, and suddenly, young Su Yu's voice rang out, "Who... are you?"

Su Yu's face showed a hint of concentration. Did I see the shadow when I was young?

The shadow revealed its true form?

Before the shadow could speak, everyone suddenly heard an extremely joyful voice, "Grandpa! Are you Grandpa? Dad said Grandpa is amazing and can fight ten city lords at once. Is Grandpa back?"

Su Yu's expression turned strange. Grandpa?

My grandpa died early, where did this grandpa come from? I knew this when I was a kid!

"Grandpa?"

The shadow's voice sounded again, with a hint of a smile, "Little one, you've mistaken me for someone else..."

"No, Grandpa, you're my Grandpa!"

Young Su Yu was overjoyed, "Grandson Su Yu kowtows to Grandpa! Grandpa, you're finally back. Someone's been bullying Ah Yu... Grandpa, Dad just went out, I'll go call him back, Grandpa's back!"

Thud, thud, thud, it seemed young Su Yu really kowtowed...

Su Yu's expression was peculiar, and at this moment, the shadow also felt a bit strange, saying lightly, "What a clever little heart! Little one, are you afraid I'll kill you?"

"No... no... Grandpa... Grandpa wouldn't kill his grandson... Grandpa..."

"Little one, you must know that when you become powerful enough, every move you make, your thoughts, will be grasped by others!"

The shadow spoke with a smile, "I'm quite surprised that in such a family, a small child has such a clever heart. Are you trying to use your father to deal with me? Probably... not possible! He's too weak!"

The Great Zhou King and the others looked at Su Yu's true self with some peculiarity. Were you really so shrewd as a child, kneeling and calling someone Grandpa to save your life?

My goodness!

They almost believed that Su Yu's real grandpa had returned!

Or simply that the child had mistaken someone else!

"Grandpa... are you going to hit me? I'm a child without a mother... Everyone bullies me, is Grandpa going to bully me too? Grandpa..."

Su Yu's true self, his eyes flickered.

This isn't me!

Everyone heard wrong. In my memory, this never happened. I wouldn't randomly kowtow and call someone Grandpa when I was a kid.

At six years old, I wasn't that young, already at the age to attend elementary school.

Kowtowing and calling someone Grandpa... I, Su Yu, wouldn't do that!

Of course, if I thought it was a bandit or something, maybe... not necessarily!

But, this scene wasn't in my memory, I don't even remember it myself.

At this moment, the shadow spoke with a hint of laughter, "What a pity... I'm not here for you this time, otherwise, I wouldn't mind taking on a disciple... However, this time, I'm here for this recipe... The Heaven Gate is closed, and my time here is too short!"

A short sentence, yet it made Su Yu's heart tremble again.

What's going on?

The Heaven Gate is closed, is this person... a powerful figure who came out of the Heaven Gate?

So, like the Lord of the Undead, he can't stay for long, the Lord of the Undead also came as a projection of willpower before, unable to stay for long.

So this shadow... isn't the true body?

Even without the true body, Su Yu felt immense pressure!

Su Yu's heart trembled continuously, roughly forming a line of thought. The Time Sage encountered trouble, and the Book of Time was thrown back by the Time Sage.

Perhaps the Time Sage briefly opened the Heaven Gate, or perhaps this shadow's true body briefly opened the Heaven Gate, following the Book of Time back, but he couldn't stay for long.

And the Book of Time, originally intended to return to the Culture King's Residence, ended up being picked up by my dad... But why didn't this person kill my dad, instead following him back?

Su Yu was filled with confusion!

He was extremely puzzled, and young Su Yu seemed to have forgotten his fear, perhaps still kneeling on the ground, curiously asking, "Grandpa, didn't you come back to see Ah Yu?"

"Little one... interesting!"

The shadow laughed, "I'm here to find Xingyu... what a pity! I thought that in the moment of Culture King's crisis, the Book of Time would return and go to Xingyu, taking me to Xingyu... but it didn't!"

Su Yu's heart trembled again.

Looking for the Human Emperor!

Why look for the Human Emperor?

He was certain that the Time Sage's Book of Time, flying out of the Heaven Gate, would go to the Human Emperor, but the result was clearly not so, the Time Sage's will was to go home!

Just wanted to go home!

"Xingyu? Xingyu is me!"

At this moment, young Su Yu suddenly spoke, delighted, "Grandpa knows my name too? I'm Xingyu! My name is Su Yu, but my mom's surname is Xing, so I'm also called Xingyu!"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless, nonsense!

And, did I like to lie when I was a kid?

No way!

I was an honest child when I was young!

The Great Zhou King and others knew that with this change, Su Yu should be fine, and he even inherited the Book of Time. At this moment, each of them felt extremely peculiar. This incredibly powerful existence, could you have been fooled by this little brat?

Otherwise, this person clearly wasn't here for you initially, how did you end up with the Book of Time?

Could it be... you really tricked him?

As for whether the other party was looking for the Human Emperor to kill him, cooperate with him, or something else, it was hard to judge.

But everyone knew the result.

The Book of Time ended up with Su Yu!

At this moment, the shadowy figure chuckled, "Xingyu? You're not Xingyu, little one. Xingyu is a very powerful expert! But... perhaps you could be called Wenyu... the bloodline of Wen, perhaps? This place is Nanyuan... was this where Wenyu and the others were back then? Wen's territory... indeed, many places have Wen's bloodline inheritance... Wen is no weaker than I am. You casually change your ancestors, but your ancestors might not be pleased!"

The shadow's words carried a hint of amusement, "Wen, Sun, Moon, Zhou... these people were all powerful! But after countless years, the bloodlines have thinned. The Human Realm, blessed by nature... I see that this small Human Realm has quite a few strong bloodlines, but alas, they have all faded!"

The shadow sighed with emotion.

As for Su Yu and the others, they were surprised, yet not entirely so. In the Human Realm, strong bloodlines were indeed numerous, but they were often treated as nonexistent. For instance, descendants of the Human Ancestor, those with the surname Zhou, all dared to claim they were descendants of the Human Ancestor. The ancestors might just be a few individuals. Tracing back, they were all descendants of powerful figures. However, after countless generations, they could be considered nonexistent.

In Nanyuan, the fiefdom of the Culture King back then, could it be that before that, it was the territory of the Culture King's ancestor, Wen? If so, it would be normal for the people of Nanyuan to have a bit of Wen's bloodline. Su Yu didn't pay much attention to this matter. Perhaps the Great Zhou King and others still had the Human Ancestor's bloodline.

At this moment, little Su Yu might not understand and continued to sweetly ask, "Grandpa, do you also have the surname Wen?"

"Me?" The shadow seemed in no hurry. Su Yu didn't know why he said he didn't have much time, yet still had the leisure to chat with a little kid.

At this moment, the shadow laughed, "I don't have the surname Wen..."

He didn't continue on this topic and instead said, "This recipe, I should take it away. It's not something you can handle! So young, yet so perceptive. Unfortunately... too young, too weak... there's no time for you to grow..."

With a hint of laughter, he seemed about to take away the Book of Time.

At this moment, Su Yu became interested. How did I manage to keep the Book of Time? The implication was that the other party intended to take the Book of Time. As for why he didn't take it at the start, Su Yu couldn't figure it out. Su Yu was still pondering how his younger self should react to this situation.

Just then, a thunderous shout echoed through the heavens, "What demon dares to come and go as they please? Arrogant!"

The shout startled Su Yu, making him jump. At that moment, an aura swept over.

The Great Xia King!

The Great Xia King discovered this person?

Su Yu's heart trembled slightly!

It seemed... he understood something!

At this moment, the shadow seemed surprised, "I've been discovered?"

"Eternal... but with some strong bloodline..."

Before he could finish speaking, the shadow was suddenly startled, "Hmm? Who is it!"

At that moment, another aura rose, faintly discernible. The others hadn't reacted yet, but the Great Zhou King's face suddenly changed, becoming somewhat unusual.

In the next moment, a figure suddenly appeared nearby. Su Yu looked through the wall into the distance and was slightly stunned.

Was that... the Great Zhou King?

In the distance, the Great Zhou King looked around with a hint of confusion, as if muttering to himself, as if he had discovered something, "The river is turbulent... the great path is shaking, what happened?"

Suddenly, the Great Zhou King looked towards Su Yu's direction, as if he had discovered the shadow, or perhaps... discovered Su Yu watching him!

Suddenly, his gaze turned towards Su Yu's direction, and he softly said, "I can feel it..."

Muttering to himself, he actually started walking towards Su Yu.

The shadow also seemed unusual, with a strange expression, "Discovered... the Human Realm actually has a strong guardian..."

The shadow suddenly looked at little Su Yu, sighing, "Strange little guy, your luck... is extraordinary! Strange, could your fortune truly be Wen's direct lineage? It seems to be transmitted across space... strange, too strange!"

At this moment, he reached out and grabbed, causing Su Yu's true self to tremble slightly, as a vast fortune appeared.

However, the shadow seemed to have discovered nothing, saying with an odd tone, "Such a rich power of fortune, unbelievable... transmitted across space, is Wen's blessing still present?"

Now it was Su Yu's turn to feel strange!

What nonsense?

This guy is truly powerful!

So powerful that even though I'm here, he can sense the power of fortune from my true self across space!

Impressive!

But... this isn't my childhood fortune!

However, my childhood self is still me.

Saying it's my fortune isn't wrong.

Su Yu was thinking about this when the shadow suddenly sighed, "Forget it, this recipe is strange, unwilling to follow me... only willing to follow your father, perhaps it truly came to find you, or your father... Wen's bloodline power? I originally wanted to find an opportunity to leave... didn't expect, your bloodline might be even richer than your father's..."

While the shadow spoke, the Great Zhou King was approaching quickly.

In the next moment, Su Yu and the others felt a fluctuation, as if the shadow had obtained the Book of Time and suddenly pressed it into little Su Yu's body!

"Fate, sometimes, you have to believe... the person outside is strong, sooner or later he will discover the recipe... rather than giving it to him, it's better to give it to you... judging by his aura, he might be related to that Xingyu... what a pity, the recipe can't be given to him, it's already formed, average aptitude, seeking survival by cutting off the tail, without the heart to strive, giving it to him is less worthwhile than giving it to you, the unknown is more worth expecting than the known..."

The shadow sighed, "Little one, remember, if you truly rise, remember to find me in the Heaven Gate..."

With that, a powerful aura erupted from him, and soon, a powerful aura also erupted from little Su Yu!

That was the power of the Book of Time!

At this moment, outside, the Great Zhou King seemed to sense something. Just as he was about to investigate, he suddenly snorted coldly, "Luring the tiger away from the mountain? Zhou Ji's aura... you dare come to my Human Realm?"

In an instant, the Great Zhou King vanished!

Su Yu and the others looked on strangely.

What was this situation?

Zhou Ji?

Beside Su Yu, the Great Zhou King was also extremely unusual. What was going on?

Seeing Su Yu's gaze, he quickly transmitted, "This... I have some impression. Back then, it seemed like at this moment, the great path was shaking here. I thought something happened and came to investigate, but found nothing unusual. However, over at the Great Xia Prefecture, Zhou Ji's aura suddenly appeared. I thought it was a strategy to lure the tiger away from the mountain..."

"You know Zhou Ji? You knew long ago?"

Su Yu asked, and the Great Zhou King remained silent. Of course, if I didn't know, how could I tell you that Hundred Battles had a son?

At this moment, he continued, "Perhaps Zhou Ji also sensed something at that time, his aura leaked, and he disguised himself as Wan Mingze, maybe he also noticed something unusual... so, after sensing the aura, I quickly left... didn't expect, I was just a few steps away, almost met His Majesty!"

As for Su Yu, he didn't say anything.

At this moment, he was still feeling strange.

Was this shadow good or bad?

It felt very strange!

He seemed to be looking for the Human Emperor, but why would the Book of Time bring him to find the Human Emperor?

Was he related to the Culture King or the Time Sage?

Too many doubts were bombarding Su Yu.

Su Yu wasn't too worried about his childhood self... it was just a memory, after all. He should have merged with the Book of Time, but this merging seemed to be full of changes.

One moment the Great Xia King spoke, the next the Great Zhou King appeared. Su Yu didn't even know that he almost met the Great Zhou King as a child, separated by just a few dozen meters.

The Great Zhou King, didn't he sense the shadow's presence back then?

Strange!

If he didn't sense it, why did he appear here?

As he was thinking, behind him, the shadow suddenly cursed, "Cowardly, luckily I didn't leave the recipe for him, just a bit of aura leaked, and this person actually ran away... despicable, truly didn't misjudge him!"

Su Yu was stunned!

What did that mean?

Looking at the Great Zhou King's true self again, the Great Zhou King's expression was unusual, saying nothing.

Su Yu looked at him, and the Great Zhou King was extremely embarrassed, transmitting, "Well... to be honest, I sensed something, but suddenly a powerful aura erupted, and I was worried something would happen to me, so I ran away first..."

Su Yu was shocked!

You... sensed it?

The Great Zhou King was even more embarrassed, transmitting, "Your Majesty knows my situation, I can't fight to the death here, the opponent was too strong, I had to leave, I was worried something would happen to the Human Emperor, I really thought it was a strategy to lure the tiger away from the mountain, someone wanted to deal with the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu was speechless!

So, the shadow was telling the truth, back then, the Great Zhou King sensed the shadow's presence, and the shadow also knew he was discovered by the Great Zhou King, so he chose to merge the Book of Time into Su Yu's body, is that it?

In essence, it was the Great Zhou King who helped me merge with the Book of Time, is that what it means?

The key is, this guy sensed a strong aura, and he actually ran away!

He ran away!

And found an excuse, saying Zhou Ji's aura erupted, all nonsense!

Truly not a decent person!

A strong presence came to the Human Realm, shouldn't you investigate?

And the Great Zhou King, embarrassedly transmitted, "I actually came back later, but found nothing, so I thought it was just a simple strategy to lure the tiger away from the mountain..."

"I thought it was done by Hundred Battles and his group, so..."

Su Yu didn't want to listen to his explanation. At this moment, he felt the aura rising behind him!

The shadow cursed the Great Zhou King, then quickly said, "Little one, your luck... is extraordinary! Had I known this person was so cowardly, I wouldn't have merged this item into you, but now it's too late to regret... I never thought someone who could fix the sun and moon would be so cowardly..."

With a sigh, the shadow lamented, "Now, I have no strength left to search for Xingyu... that person just now... a complete scoundrel, if you have the chance, kill him! A dignified Seven Path Supreme, fleeing without even seeing the enemy... if he were in my era, he would be a scoundrel... deserves to be killed!"

As the words fell, the shadow sighed again, "Because of him, the Heaven Gate can no longer suppress and must be completely closed. I have to leave now. Lucky you, little one! Well, it's destined, time to go!"

Boom!

An overwhelming aura surged, and in an instant, that aura and Su Yu's internal aura erupted simultaneously.

Su Yu suddenly turned back!

At that moment, he saw his younger self, covered in blood, his body shattered. The shadow's power surged, instantly reconstructing his body, continuously erupting, suppressing the power of the Book of Time, with a hint of exhaustion and helplessness.

"That guy ruined my plans. Next time I see him, I'll definitely kill him..."

Beside Su Yu, the Great Zhou King’s expression changed slightly.

And at that moment, the shadow seemed to sense something, suddenly pausing, murmuring, "Fortune isolation... memory recall? Is it your true self recalling... have you really risen?"

With some surprise, the next moment, the shadow shattered, carrying a trace of regret, "Well... I don't know if you heard, go find Xingyu... tell him..."

With a loud bang, Su Yu saw a portal emerge!

The shadow vanished in an instant.

He didn't even finish his sentence!

Su Yu was stunned. What the hell, you didn't even finish your sentence before disappearing!

Speechless!

Couldn't you say the important part before breaking apart?

You want me to find the Human Emperor, but what exactly should I tell him?

Damn it!

Su Yu was extremely frustrated!

At this moment, he also saw himself, his aura beginning to decline, the whole person falling into a coma!

Su Yu was helpless, fine, if I don't merge now, it'll be too late!

If the aura completely declines, merging into the body, this past self won't be considered strong.

Just now, when the shadow's aura merged with the Book of Time's aura, that was his strongest moment.

Su Yu didn't say more, shouting lowly, taking advantage of the fact that both auras hadn't dissipated, he suddenly reached out from the endless void, across a world, not even in the same time and space, these were just some origin imprints left behind in the past.

However, during this period, many powerful beings arrived, making the origin of this period particularly strong.

Su Yu roared lowly, reaching out a large hand, grabbing the memory of young Su Yu, pulling him out of this world!

And this world began to shatter!

Su Yu and his group instantly appeared in the River of Memories, and the entire River of Memories was rapidly turbulent. Behind Su Yu, a faint shadow of his younger self emerged.

Eyes closed, but the two auras on his body clashed, the aura extremely strong, seemingly even stronger than the current Su Yu.

And Su Yu, not caring about merging, instantly turned to look at the Great Zhou King, with some seriousness, "What about the seven supreme paths? Did you deliberately ignore it back then, or did you really escape?"

The Great Zhou King opened his mouth, Su Yu looked at him coldly.

The Great Zhou King grimaced, helpless, quickly said, "He... he just said it casually..."

"Tell the truth!"

Behind Su Yu, the River of Memories began to collapse, Su Yu didn't care, "If you don't speak, just stay here!"

The Great Zhou King was speechless, quickly said, "It's not about the seven supreme paths... it's just... just that I cultivated seven great daos..."

Su Yu looked at him coldly, the Great Zhou King saw this, more helpless, had to say, "Alright, I mastered the power of seven great daos, but truly not considered a supreme being, and many of the great daos are sealed, I can't use them!"

He said helplessly, quickly said, "To be honest, I'm not as strong as His Majesty, seven trash daos, at most a third-class peak! Moreover, many daos are sealed, if I were really that strong, I would have killed those Hundred Battle guys long ago... Hundred Battle, Yu, they joined forces, I can't match them, Your Majesty, I'm really not lying to you!"

Su Yu looked at him coldly, third-class peak?

Unable to match the joint forces of Hundred Battle?

It's possible, but a very terrifying guy, mastering seven great daos!

Su Yu quickly walked towards the front of the River of Memories, merging into his past self as he walked, behind him, the small Su Yu suddenly opened his eyes, a powerful aura rising!

Countless doubts surfaced in Su Yu's mind, he said as he walked, "That shadow, do you know who it is? Why can it follow the Book of Time to the Human Realm, and why is it looking for the Human Emperor?"

"Not too clear..."

The Great Zhou King saw Su Yu's unpleasant expression, only to say gloomily, "Not too clear, most likely an existence sealed in the Heaven Gate long ago! I... I guess, looking for the Human Emperor may not be to deal with the Human Emperor, a projection is difficult to deal with the Human Emperor... I guess, is it... Xing?"

He uncertainly said, "Maybe there's something to tell the Human Emperor!"

"Xing?"

Su Yu was shocked, "The Human Emperor's ancestor?"

"Possibly!"

"How did you determine that?"

Su Yu was puzzled, how come I didn't see that he was Xing.

The Great Zhou King quickly said, "Earlier, young Su Yu... ahem, when His Majesty was young, said you are Xingyu, he later said, Wen is not weaker than me, don't randomly change ancestors, I think, he might be Xing!"

"Looking for His Majesty the Human Emperor, maybe there's something to inform, or other... he's just a projection, obviously can't kill the Human Emperor, that projection, at most second-class power, may not even last long..."

"So, I guess, maybe not here to kill, but to convey some message."

The Great Zhou King added, "As for coming along the Time Sage's Book of Time to find His Majesty the Human Emperor, it actually makes sense, the strongest in this era is the Human Emperor! If the Time Sage wants to find help, it's best to find His Majesty the Human Emperor! And the Human Emperor and the Culture King are very close, also familiar with the Time Sage, logically, the Book of Time seeking rescue should go to the Human Emperor..."

Su Yu didn't know if his judgment was correct, but at this moment, he couldn't obtain more information.

He only knew that this powerful existence had actually met him when he was young.

And his integration into the Book of Time was full of mysteries.

The Great Zhou King, the Great Xia King had both appeared near him, not to mention the Great Xia King, that guy shouted, Su Yu judged, probably because he sensed something, felt someone lurking, deliberately shouted to scare them off.

But the appearance of the Great Zhou King was because he really discovered that one!

As a result, he ran away!

Su Yu continued to merge into his past self, his aura gradually growing stronger, he said with some seriousness, "What's going on, the Human Emperor's issues haven't been resolved yet, now, even the Human Emperor's ancestor has appeared! So, a group of people from the opening of the heavens period are really still alive? All behind the Heaven Gate? If he's Xing, then the Wen, Sun, Moon he mentioned... are these people also still alive?"

Su Yu frowned, too many strong people is not a good thing, it will interfere with some of his plans.

Of course, it was expected that there would be many strong people in the Heaven Gate, just didn't know their identities.

Now maybe he knew!

It really was a group of strong people from the opening of the heavens period that were sealed!

Su Yu had a headache!

Heaven Gate, what the hell is it?

Who sealed these existences?

What did this shadow want to say to the Human Emperor?

In the end, he didn't even finish his sentence, just disappeared, what kind of nonsense is this!

And the Great Zhou King...

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King again, the Great Zhou King was helpless, don't look at me like that, he had to say, "Your Majesty, I really have nothing to hide! The reason I didn't want to say too much, some things are because Your Majesty knowing won't help much, some are... I was scared by Hundred Battle back then!"

He was also very helpless!

Had to say, "The matter in Nanyuan back then, I really thought it was done by Hundred Battle and the others, these guys, never give up! And the aura that erupted from the other side, probably had the power of a second or third-class ruler of laws... I thought it was Yu who broke into the Human Realm..."

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Nonsense, Yu hadn't even broken the seal at that time!"

The Great Zhou King explained, "Your Majesty, we people, can actually briefly erupt some aura, not necessarily have to break the seal! I'm actually in the same state as them..."

"Really the same, if I break the Human Emperor's seal, you should be unsealed too!"

Su Yu said coldly, "So, you now have mastered seven great daos? No, maybe it's 9, the two of endurance, you mastered later, so, you are now a strong person with nine great daos! You at least have a second-class!"

"Really not..."

"Even if not, you must have!"

Su Yu looked at him coldly, "Even if you have to transform, you must become second-class! Nine great daos, even if weak, the power of one great dao is not too weak, let alone nine!"

The Great Zhou King was helpless, "Your Majesty, if I really reached second-class, I would have gone upstream long ago, I'm about the same as the Martial Emperor, still a bit short."

"Heh!"

Su Yu sneered, at this moment, his aura constantly fluctuating!

I don't believe you!

"If you can't become second-class... I naturally have ways to deal with you!"

Su Yu transmitted two words: "Ren Shan!"

The Great Zhou King's face turned green, wanting to cry without tears, "Your Majesty, I'm really just third-class, not lying to you, at this point, I have no need to deceive Your Majesty, I've told Your Majesty my biggest secret, why deceive Your Majesty on this?"

Su Yu ignored him!

True or false, if you don't become second-class, I will naturally trouble you.

Although the Great Zhou King always hid many things, Su Yu was too lazy to argue with him, mainly because he was scared by Hundred Battle, but that's Hundred Battle's business, you were deceived by this scumbag, you always guarded against me, this is very inappropriate!

This is like being cheated by an ex, you always guard against the current one cheating on you, this is very wrong, the successor is an honest person, what did he do to you?

Beside him, the Great Zhou King was helpless, saying nothing more.

And the others, one by one, remained silent, recalling everything just now.

The shadow, the Book of Time, the Great Zhou King...

Also, young Su Yu, was also a bad seed.

Kneeling everywhere acknowledging grandfathers!

No wonder when he rose back then, he also acknowledged relatives everywhere, turns out, he was like this when he was young!

The Great Zhou King didn't want to continue this topic either, changing the subject, "Your Majesty is actually of the same ancestor as the Culture King..."

Su Yu scoffed, "Nonsense, according to that logic, everyone in Nanyuan is a descendant of the Culture King!"

So what?

If you go by that, everyone surnamed Zhou would be a descendant of the Human Ancestor!

Countless years have passed, and the bloodlines have become so mixed that there are no longer any pure-blooded humans. Everyone's lineage is a bit muddled.

Alright, even the Great Zhou King was at a loss for words and couldn't continue the argument.

Su Yu quickly returned to the entrance of the River of Memory and suddenly said, "Forget everything that just happened!"

"Understood!"

The others responded, understanding that it wasn't about forgetting everything, just the part where they had to bow and call someone 'grandfather' when they were young. It wasn't a big deal.

How old were you back then?

Nobody paid it much mind!

Su Yu didn't say much more, but his thoughts were racing. Was this shadow really a star?

Beyond the Heaven Gate, Su Yu's interest was truly piqued.

The Lord of the Undead was there, the Culture King was there, the Martial King was there, the Time Sage was there, and countless other powerful beings. It seemed like all the ancient ancestors of the myriad races from the era of creation were there!

What kind of scene lay beyond the Heaven Gate?

"First, I'll merge with my past self, and later, I'll merge with my future self... As for the rest, I'll leave it be!"

Su Yu suppressed some of his thoughts. For now, the Heaven Gate was far more dangerous than the Human Emperor's side, and it wasn't a place he could venture into.
