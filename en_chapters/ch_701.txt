Chapter 701: Ascending to the Upper Realm

After leaving the place where the West King's Consort was suppressed, Su Yu quickly began to sort through all his treasures. He couldn't bring the weapon of the Immortal Battle Marquis; it was too risky. If he brought it along, the Immortal Battle Marquis would likely notice. The council token was another item he couldn't take. Anything that might have connections to the Upper Realm, whether belonging to humans or other races, Su Yu left behind.

As for losing these treasures? Did it matter? The Upper Realm was filled with powerful beings and countless treasures. Wouldn't they all be mine eventually? Everything I see is mine! Su Yu didn't care at all.

...

It wasn't just him. In the grand hall, everyone else had arrived as well. Su Yu spoke sternly, "Everyone, apart from your weapons, do not bring anything else! Better safe than sorry. If anything is linked to the Upper Realm, it could spell big trouble!"

"The Iron Devourer Race can bring their tokens, but they must be sealed. I'll personally seal them. Other than that, nothing else is allowed!"

There were quite a few people present. Lantian, the Great Zhou King, the Great Ming King, the Extermination King, the Little Zhou King, Xia Longwu, Nan Wujian, Yun Chen, Hu Xiansheng, and Su Yu himself made up ten humans. Tun Tian, Kong Kong, Chang He, and Jiuyue were four allies. Additionally, there were twenty guardians who hadn't reached the Daofuse Realm. Su Yu didn't bring all of them, only nine non-Daofuse guardians, and Xinghong would accompany them as well.

Heavendoom wanted to go, but Su Yu refused! No way! If that guy went along, he'd stir up trouble even if there wasn't any.

Twenty-four powerful individuals! Including Su Yu, six had Daofuse combat strength. The rest, like Hu Xiansheng, Chang He, and Tun Tian, were not at the Eternal level. Hu Xiansheng was brought along because he and Kong Kong were skilled in the Dao of Space, which might be useful during the teleportation process.

As everyone gathered and began checking their belongings, the Great Zhou King suddenly frowned slightly. "Emperor Yu, there are twenty-four of us, but only one female, Guardian Xiaguang. Isn't that too few?"

He felt Su Yu was too biased against women. Such an unbalanced group could be problematic.

Su Yu replied irritably, "Are there many female experts in the Upper Realm?"

"Well... there are quite a few," the Great Zhou King chuckled. "There are indeed quite a few."

Su Yu frowned, pondering for a moment before saying, "The issue is, we don't have many female experts to begin with. Yunxiao and the others have already reached the Daofuse Realm. I would prefer to bring more non-Daofuse individuals to scout ahead."

The Great Zhou King smiled, "I mean, we could select a few..."

Before he could finish, Lantian, in a soft voice, said, "Don't I count?"

"......"

Everyone turned to look at Lantian, who now appeared as a delicate young girl, timidly gazing at the Great Zhou King.

The Great Zhou King's head nearly exploded! Damn! Pretend I didn't say anything. I've just brought trouble upon myself by bringing this lunatic out!

Beside him, the Extermination King twitched but remained silent. He couldn't afford to provoke Lantian now. However, being around Lantian gave him a psychological shadow. He was internally cursing, hoping not to be taken along with Lantian. He didn't want to go!

Of course, he understood Su Yu's intentions. Su Yu wanted to use this opportunity to help those selected reach Daofuse combat strength. Being chosen to ascend to the Upper Realm with Su Yu was an honor and a good opportunity.

But... Lantian was there. The Extermination King wanted to cry! He didn't want this honor anymore. Unfortunately, he didn't dare to speak up now. Lantian occasionally glanced at him, making him uncomfortable.

Su Yu glanced at the Great Zhou King, who weakly said, "Let's just leave it at that. This setup is fine."

Forget it! Lantian, do you even care about gender? Don't worry too much!

Su Yu also smiled and quickly said, "Lantian, when we reach the Upper Realm, don't wander off or cause trouble..."

"I'll listen to Emperor Yu," Lantian replied softly, looking at Su Yu with admiration, nodding obediently.

Su Yu felt helpless! It was tricky, but bringing Lantian along had its advantages. Perhaps Lantian could leave some clones in the Upper Realm. This time, they were just scouting. Of course, if they could kill, they would. If not, they would retreat in time! Lantian could plant some seeds for the future.

Su Yu didn't say much more. He looked at the experts still organizing their belongings and quickly said, "Hand everything over to Director Wan for safekeeping. Retrieve them when we return!"

With that, he waved his hand, tearing open the River of Time. "Let's take a trip through the River of Time to cleanse our bodies and avoid leaving any hidden dangers."

Everyone was speechless. Su Yu was truly cautious to the extreme! The Great Zhou King was also amazed. When it came to caution, Su Yu was unexpectedly meticulous. Taking a trip through the River of Time... it would cause some damage to everyone.

Of course, since Su Yu had said so, no one objected. Soon, a group of people entered the River of Time. As the waves surged, Su Yu shouted, "Don't resist, let the river cleanse you. You won't die! If we're not careful now and get discovered in the Upper Realm, are we courting death?"

In the crowd, Lantian casually remarked, "I think we might be discovered within a day or two of going up."

"......"

Su Yu looked at him, and Lantian shyly said, "I'm praising Emperor Yu's prowess. We'll be known after killing a Heavenly King within two days!"

"......"

Everyone wanted to laugh but held it in. The Great Zhou King also wanted to laugh. On second thought, it wasn't impossible. With all the preparations, they might soon encounter strong enemies and engage in battle, quickly revealing their presence.

Su Yu's face darkened, and he snapped, "Shut up! Even if we're discovered, we must hide our identities! If we're found out, we'll pretend to be under the command of Marquis Tianyang! Marquis Tianyang died hundreds of years ago. After his death, some of his subordinates fled. We are those people! These people were randomly killed by Marquis Modang, who didn't care because there were no Daofuse experts. We must pretend to be under Marquis Tianyang's command. Don't let anything slip!"

"Jiuyue, Tun Tian, you will pretend to be mounts. It's not unusual for humans to have a few ancient races among them."

"If we're discovered, just say this. Don't volunteer information. The human race is in decline and won't expose themselves willingly, but some clues can be used to judge..."

With that, Su Yu took out some clothes and waved his hand, revealing some images. "Dress according to their style! Also, if we do engage in battle, hide your strength unless I say to go all out!"

No one said much more. They all dressed according to the images Su Yu showed. Different marquises had different styles for their subordinates. If they encountered someone knowledgeable, they would know whose subordinates they were.

Su Yu continued, "I, the Great Zhou King, and Lantian can hide our strength. Jiuyue just advanced, so it's a bit difficult..."

He looked at the Great Ming King. "Great Ming King, you don't need to hide. You're human. Pretend to be Jiuyue's master. Jiuyue will cooperate with the Great Ming King. As for me, I'm the son of Marquis Tianyang. Great Ming King, you're my protector. The others are the Tianyang Army..."

Su Yu roughly arranged things. It wasn't too strict, just enough to have a cover story. In reality, if they encountered someone who could see through them, Su Yu would likely eliminate them!

The disguise was only for special occasions.

Su Yu quickly turned to Xinghong and the others, speaking seriously, "Guardians, some of you might be recognized by old relics in the Upper Realm, including the Great Zhou King. Conceal yourselves well, don't expose us. It should be obvious who you are!"

Everyone nodded again.

At this moment, after being washed by the River of Time for a while, some couldn't endure it any longer. Only then did Su Yu tear open the river and quickly step out. Fortunately, none of them had brought anything special.

It wasn't that he distrusted them, but he feared they might unknowingly carry items containing the power of laws that could be used for tracking.

Soon, Su Yu returned to the grand hall. The group had changed into their new clothes. At this moment, several others had arrived in the hall. The Great Qin King and others were there, looking quite serious. They were worried about Su Yu's trip to the Upper Realm, especially since Su Yu had consumed a lot of his lifespan recently.

Su Yu didn't say much more. He had already said everything that needed to be said. Now, he spoke firmly, "The myriad races of the lower realm are temporarily in your hands! Guard our foundation! Anyone who dares to cause trouble will be severely punished! I don't care if they're human or from the myriad races; the rules are the same! Director Wan, if you can't suppress them at a critical moment, you can ask a few powerful beings to help! I've already made arrangements, including with the Death Realm!"

"Understood!" Wan Tiansheng replied, quickly smiling, "Rest assured!"

Su Yu nodded, "With Director Wan here, I'm at ease! The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King can also suppress the human race. Don't let any trouble arise. Lastly, if you encounter a strong enemy, retreat first. Don't engage in a tough battle. Just protect the human race. That's all!"

With that, he tore open the void. Just as he did, he looked at the Great Zhou King. The Great Zhou King remained silent, and a character appeared, quickly transporting the group away.

He was sensible; otherwise, Su Yu would have reprimanded him again. There was no choice. The Great Zhou King had repeatedly expressed hope for the return of the Hundred Battle King.

...

After seven or eight consecutive teleportations, the Great Zhou King was panting heavily. The group arrived in the endless void. Darkness stretched infinitely, with no sky or earth. Only murkiness and darkness.

This was the endless void.

The Great Zhou King led the way, continuing to teleport. The distances were short now. After several more teleportations, Su Yu began to sense some fluctuations. There were guardians lurking near the passage.

As soon as Su Yu and his group appeared, Shan Qi and Zhan Qiong emerged, along with Zhao Chuan and a few others. Seeing Su Yu's group, Zhao Chuan felt a bit apprehensive. Were they really going up? He recognized several powerful figures. Bringing so many people up... this Human Lord was quite bold.

Su Yu ignored them and turned to Shan Qi, who quickly pointed upwards. "The passage is up there, but it won't appear for another three days! After that, it will only appear once a month!"

Without needing Su Yu's instructions, Kong Kong, Hu Xiansheng, and the Great Ming King quickly flew into the sky to check if there was a formation concealing it.

Meanwhile, Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate and looked into the void. With a wave of his hand, a portal drawn by Su Yu himself appeared in the air.

"The entrance is here, but it's obscured by a power of laws. Study it carefully!"

Shan Qi and the others gasped. They had guarded this place for months just to pinpoint the exact location of the entrance. Yet, Su Yu saw through it with a single glance.

Su Yu glanced at them and said solemnly, "Once we go up, we'll definitely need to come back down. Maybe not through this passage, but it's highly likely. This place needs to be guarded to prevent any ambush."

He continued, "I'll summon Heavendoom, Empyrean Cloud, and the others to station here, with six to eight Daofuse Realm experts. Book Spirit and Tea Plant will also come. Even if a Heavenly King arrives, they can hold them off!"

Shan Qi breathed a sigh of relief. "That's best. I was worried we couldn't hold it. The endless void is near the Heavenly Overseer Marquis."

Su Yu nodded slightly, wary of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis as well. With everything arranged, they just needed to wait for the passage to appear and ascend together.

In the void, the Great Ming King and others began their research, pulling the Great Zhou King into their discussions since he knew about this passage.

Su Yu glanced at them and then transmitted to Shan Qi, "After we leave, send Zhao Chuan and the others back to the Human Realm. If I don't return, no one is to contact them. I've already informed Director Wan."

"Understood!" Shan Qi quickly responded.

...

While waiting for the passage to appear, on the second day, Heavendoom, Empyrean Cloud, Tea Plant, and Book Spirit arrived.

In addition to Su Yu and his group, there were now six Daofuse Realm experts gathered here. Heavendoom and the others had been redeployed from the previous Four Kings’ Domains. Originally, two Daofuse experts were stationed in each realm, but adjustments were made: two remained in the Dragon Realm, while only one each was stationed in the Phoenix, Kunpeng, and Ape Realms.

At this point, all of Su Yu's Daofuse combat forces were assigned tasks, and manpower was somewhat tight.

Wan Tiansheng and others were guarding the Human Realm, Tian Yue and Duobao were seeking councilor tokens among the myriad races, and allied races each had their own tasks. Except for the Life Emperor, Su Yu hadn't placed many people in the Life Race to avoid detection by the Upper Realm.

As for the last time when they impersonated Dao King, whether the Immortal Battle Marquis would send treasures down again, there hadn't been any major battles recently, so if they did, it would be fine. The Immortal Battle Marquis likely couldn't infiltrate with his will.

Unless a major battle erupted, causing strong rules to shift.

...

Su Yu waited another day. The Great Ming King and others had made some progress. On the third day, a faint passage entrance appeared in the void.

The Upper Realm Passage!

Su Yu quickly appeared at the entrance, took a deep breath, and looked at the people behind him. He said solemnly, "The passage is surely unsafe. Everyone, be careful to avoid being swept away by spatial rifts!"

"Outside the passage, there might be strong experts stationed, or maybe not. If there are, take them down quickly. Don't let our information leak!"

"If anyone is unlucky enough to be swept away, return to the Myriad Realms if you can. If you end up in the Upper Realm, don't wander around. Go to the Iron Devourer Race's May Dojo and wait for me to pick you up!"

Everyone nodded.

At this moment, the passage entrance began to emit a faint suction. The Great Zhou King quickly said, "This passage will remain open for an hour! After that, it will disappear quickly."

Su Yu nodded slightly but didn't enter. He planned to wait until the last moment, just before it disappeared, to enter, to prevent anyone from following, though the likelihood was low.

Actually, he was guarding against Heavendoom.

Sure enough, when Su Yu didn't move, Heavendoom grew anxious and appeared instantly, urging, "Hurry up and go in, or the passage will disappear!"

Su Yu turned to him, annoyed, "Stay put! I'll go in when it's about to disappear. What, are you planning to follow me right after I enter? Don't cause trouble!"

Heavendoom was speechless.

After a while, he muttered, "I didn't plan on that! Also, why are you taking Grandstar and not me?"

He even pulled in an ally, "If you don't trust me, you should trust Empyrean Cloud. Why not take her?"

In the distance, Empyrean Cloud appeared, looking somewhat expectant.

Su Yu cleared his throat, "No, Empyrean Cloud needs to stay here to watch the passage and you. I trust her more. With her guarding the passage, I'm more at ease. I don't want to come back and find this place has changed hands and get ambushed!"

Empyrean Cloud, though a bit disappointed, was visibly pleased and smiled, "Rest assured, Emperor Yu. With me here, I'll keep a close watch on the passage and make sure Heavendoom doesn't wander off!"

Heavendoom felt like crying.

Fool!

Even dumber than me!

Su Yu praises you a little, and you forget who you are!

On the way here, you weren't saying that. You kept complaining about why you weren't taken, but Grandstar was.

Indeed, women are unreliable!

Heavendoom grumbled internally, realizing why Su Yu didn't take women to the Upper Realm—they're too unreliable. Just moments ago, she was on my side, and now she's guarding me!

Su Yu held back his laughter, while behind him, Grandstar looked smug and raised his eyebrows at Heavendoom.

Heavendoom was nearly furious!

He hated Grandstar, who always boasted to him from the start.

After a few jokes, Su Yu waited a bit longer. When the time seemed right, he took a deep breath, and a small stone appeared in his hand. This thing was the real treasure, suppressing all disobedience!

At this moment, Su Yu had a vague guess about what it was.

The Human Lord Seal!

Of course, he wasn't sure, but he knew the Human Lord Seal could suppress everything. It wasn't strong in attack but could suppress many things, including fortune, the River of Time, and the power of laws.

The Human Lord Seal had reached the level of a divine weapon.

If this was the Human Emperor Seal, it wouldn't be surprising that it could suppress everything.

Legend had it that this was the only imperial weapon.

But... would the Human Emperor Seal be buried at the Culture King's Residence by Xingyue?

You have to know, back then, the ancient era hadn't fallen yet. Not long after, the Culture King went to awaken Xingyue. Could the Human Emperor Seal have been lost then?

It doesn't add up!

According to Su Yu's understanding, there were still movements of the Human Emperor Seal at the end of the ancient era.

It couldn't have been buried so early!

So, he wasn't sure and couldn't judge. If it wasn't the Human Emperor Seal, could it be the Human Emperor Seal's sibling?

That's possible!

For instance, when it was forged, two were made, one large and one small, one public and one private.

That could exist!

Otherwise, this kind of suppressive power couldn't be explained by ordinary treasures.

It might be the seal the Human Emperor used in the early days. Su Yu had some guesses that the Human Emperor might have had two seals, one used before unifying the Myriad Realms and one after.

If so, it would make sense.

This small stone might also be the Human Lord Seal, used when the Human Emperor was the Human Lord.

Such a guess fits reality better.

Of course, at this moment, Su Yu wasn't concerned about what it was. As long as it was useful!

"Let's go, enter!"

Su Yu said no more, quickly stepping inside, followed by the others. The Great Zhou King and Lantian guarded him on both sides, wary of any crisis.

Who knew what the passage was like?

What Zhao Chuan and the others said might not be true.

...

Once Su Yu and his group left, Empyrean Cloud kept a close watch on Heavendoom, who felt exhausted.

Boring!

I didn't say I would follow, seriously.

As they watched the passage, waiting for it to disappear, a figure silently approached from afar.

From a distance, the figure stopped and glanced over. It was none other than the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

At this moment, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis looked calm, glancing over with eyes that emitted beams of light. Soon, the figures of Heavendoom and the others appeared in his eyes, with beams of light above their heads.

"Fortune like a rainbow!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis chuckled softly, somewhat wistful.

These guardians now had fortunes like rainbows, unstoppable!

Six Daofuse experts guarding!

"Su Yu is quite capable!"

He sighed. There were six Daofuse experts here, and Su Yu had taken several more with him. The Iron Devourer Emperor and others hadn't been used, and the Human Race also had several top-tier Daofuse experts.

The God Devourer Race and Old Turtle hadn't been deployed either.

In such a short time, Su Yu had accumulated so much.

A terrifying fellow!

Just as he thought this, his expression changed. In the next moment, not far away, the void tore open, and Wan Tiansheng, clad in white, arrived alone, looking at the Heavenly Overseer Marquis from afar. He said calmly, "Don't cause trouble. I'll give you a chance to settle things with Su Yu! If you cause trouble, I'll pay some price to deal with you while Su Yu is away!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis chuckled, "You?"

Wan Tiansheng shook his head, "No, many people! Including true Heavenly King-level experts! If you think you can match the South King, Fat Ball, Hongmeng, and me together, you can try!"

"South King?"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, "What about the other three kings?"

"Dead."

"As expected!"

With a sigh, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, "Let me ask a question. If you answer, I won't cause trouble."

Wan Tiansheng said calmly, "Lantian inherited the Pen Dao. Even if you get it, you can't succeed! For Lantian to succeed, Su Yu burned ten thousand years of lifespan. If you think someone would do that for you, you can try!"

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis was stunned, then laughed after a moment, "I wondered why his aura felt off, like he was on the brink of death. So that's why!"

With a sigh and a long exhale, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, "I'm not disappointed. You're right; even if I got it, I couldn't succeed! So, the Culture King never intended for me to inherit the Pen Dao."

"No, he just hoped a true genius would do it!"

Wan Tiansheng spoke calmly, "The pen dao and paper dao he left behind can only be inherited by absolute geniuses, including the ink dao! As for the dao of the Wild Beast, it's somewhat inferior. That's not his dao, so the conditions are lower, which is why it was left with Fat Ball to find a reliable person to inherit it. The dao he left in the Myriad Realms is known to everyone, yet no one can inherit it."

Indeed, everyone knew about the paper dao and pen dao, though only a small number of people could manifest them. People knew that the Culture Tomb might allow them to take a step forward, and once it appeared, countless people would fight over it. But so what? The Culture Tomb had been in the Human Realm for many years, touched by countless people, yet in the end, only Su Yu succeeded.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis chuckled, "Indeed, the Culture King was a proud man! If he took a liking to someone, everything was negotiable. If not, he wouldn't even bother to say a word!"

With a sigh, he laughed again, "The Culture King... it's a pity, he also made mistakes. He punished the Control King, probably never imagining that the Control King would dare to betray him!"

After a moment of reflection, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis softly said, "In that case, I won't linger. Wan Tiansheng, you can't kill me. Even if you could, what would it cost you? Even if you could, would you dare? Killing me would gather fortune upon you, and would you then compete with Su Yu for the position of Human Emperor?"

He laughed brightly, "Besides Su Yu, anyone who kills me might end up opposing him! So, let's all live in peace. I'm not interested in informing Tiangu and the others..."

Wan Tiansheng replied quietly, "You wouldn't dare! Unless you're willing to give up your last chance! Besides, even if Tiangu and the others knew, what could they do? Open the Upper Realm early? Then let them open it!"

"You people... always so eloquent."

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis laughed, sighed, and stepped into the air, saying, "I'm leaving. I should go into seclusion and wait for that battle! I hope it comes soon."

Wan Tiansheng did not stop him. Su Yu had said not to start a war. Unless the Heavenly Overseer Marquis truly threatened Su Yu, Wan Tiansheng would not initiate a battle at this moment.

As the Heavenly Overseer Marquis departed, his face turned solemn as he moved away. Only after he had gone far did he glance back. At that moment, three pairs of eyes suddenly appeared in the void in the distance.

Yes, three pairs.

One pair belonged to Doubao, another to Old Turtle, and the last to... Fat Ball!

The next moment, Fat Ball hurriedly said, "Not fighting, right? I'm leaving, there's something at home, very busy!"

With a whoosh, it disappeared!

Too busy!

Su Yu had taken Little Stone away, and now, although Big Wood had also gained intelligence and could suppress things for a while, once Fat Ball left, the Culture King's Residence would collapse within a day!

This time, Wan Tiansheng had called it over, and it had come in a hurry, almost dying of anxiety.

"Hey, Doggy, who are you? I think I know you..."

Behind, Doubao quickly chased after it.

The little white dog ran fast, and Doubao wasn't slow either, quickly catching up and shouting, "Doggy, have we met before?"

"We have, I even kicked you!"

The little white dog sped up, and Doubao hurriedly followed, "Really? You're the Culture King's dog, so why didn't I see you later?"

"I stayed at home with the young master, you left later."

"Oh." Doubao responded, then quickly asked, "Is my young master with you?"

"Yes."

"Hasn't proven the dao yet?"

"Soon."

"Oh, Doggy, why did you kick me before?"

"You were too annoying."

"Am I annoying? I rarely talk, only to familiar people..."

"You're annoying now, I need to go home!"

"Alright!"

"......"

A dog and a ball exchanged a few words and quickly left.

...

Back at the original spot.

Old Turtle emerged, speaking in a deep voice, "Why not deal with him?"

The opportunity was rare!

With four great experts present, if they fought the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, he might fall.

Wan Tiansheng took a deep breath and said, "He's right. Killing him might distribute fortune to whoever does it. It's not appropriate for us to kill him! Let's wait for Su Yu to return and let him do it himself!"

"As long as he doesn't cause trouble, give him a chance!"

After Wan Tiansheng finished speaking, Old Turtle said heavily, "He might have stepped into the Heavenly King level!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded.

"Then... can we match him?"

"We can, I suppose!"

Old Turtle said in a deep voice, "What if we can't?"

"Then we'll besiege him!"

"......"

Hongmeng rolled his eyes, thinking, these scholars are really shameless!

I thought you'd say if we can't, we'd just accept our fate.

"Alright, I'll head back then!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "Senior Hongmeng, you should return. I should head back too."

With those words, both of them disappeared from the spot.

Despite so many powerful beings gathering here, Heavendoom and the others in the distance didn't sense anything, clearly indicating a significant gap between the two sides.

...

At the same time.

A group of people stepped into the passage, where fierce astral winds raged.

The powerful astral winds swept over everyone, and even someone as strong as Su Yu felt the bone-chilling cold and pain.

The weaker ones, like Hu Xiansheng, who hadn't proven the dao yet, were almost killed by a gust of wind. Fortunately, the Great Zhou King pulled him aside, shielding him from the astral winds.

Su Yu didn't intervene; they had just entered, and it wasn't that easy to die.

He opened his Heaven Gate, observing for a while, then proceeded along the passage, speaking in a low voice, "Stay with me, don't move around!"

"Understood!"

Everyone responded, following Su Yu closely.

With his Heaven Gate open, Su Yu's predictive abilities were at their peak. He occasionally shouted, "Astral wind incoming, avoid it!"

"Lightning tribulation appearing, Great Zhou King!"

"......"

With each shout, everyone cooperated seamlessly, constantly avoiding the punitive forces. Up ahead, Su Yu even took out Little Stone to stabilize the somewhat unstable passage.

The astral winds and punitive forces could all be avoided and dealt with, as long as the passage wasn't destroyed.

Everyone was busy setting up formations, cutting through space, and moving forward smoothly.

After a while, even the Great Zhou King couldn't help but sigh, "Those guys who survived were really lucky. Generally, even Daofuse experts have to rely on luck to survive. A slight mistake could be fatal!"

This thing really depended on luck!

Of course, someone like Su Yu, who could directly see through the power of laws, wasn't relying on luck but cheating. It wasn't fair play.

Su Yu said calmly, "With the strength of the Great Zhou King and Lantian, even if they forced their way through, they might get injured, but dying would be difficult!"

Saying this, he turned to look at Lantian, his face darkening, "Why are you leaving a clone in this ghostly place?"

Everyone was speechless.

Lantian, leaving a clone even here?

Unbelievable!

Lantian transformed into a little girl, giggling, "It's fun. I want to see if the clone will be blown away or killed, and if blown away, where it will end up? Just trying it out, I'm not short of a clone anyway."

"......"

Having many clones, he was indeed capricious.

At this moment, Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him anymore. Looking ahead, he took a deep breath, "We're almost there. I can feel the weakening of the power of laws. Once we're out, if there are people, take them down quickly!"

Everyone was a bit excited.

They were about to reach the Upper Realm!

...

At this moment.

In a perilous place in the Upper Realm, known as the Soul Burying Mountain.

A very dangerous place.

The massive mountain range was pitch black, casting a shadow over the sky, turning it black. This place was inhabited by a type of soul-drilling worm, very small and not strong, but extremely terrifying. They were silent and invisible, and if you weren't careful, they would burrow into your sea of will and body, quickly parasitizing and devouring everything.

Many powerful beings had fallen victim to them. Even knowing of their existence, you couldn't see or smell them, and could only constantly defend against them, which was very consuming.

So, unless absolutely necessary, no one would come here.

At this moment, deep within the mountain, in a pitch-black cave, two figures were silently lurking, constantly watching a dark vortex in the cave.

"Liushan, do you think there's still hope? Are any of those who went down still alive?"

"Hard to say! The lord said there might be survivors, as not all the soul tokens have shattered."

Speaking, Liushan transmitted, "Also, it seems there's been a change in the lower realm. It's said a great battle erupted, killing many strong beings from the myriad races. Recently, the siege against us has loosened a bit. I heard they're discussing how to deal with the human experts from the lower realm."

"Are there really experts? After the last tide ended, everyone fled to the Upper Realm. The lower realm might not even have a single Eternal left..."

"That, I don't know!"

"......"

The two had been guarding here for a long time, still holding onto some hope, not knowing if any of those who went down would return.

But, it's been months with no movement.

Either they stayed in the lower realm and didn't return, or they're all dead.

The one who spoke earlier transmitted again, "It's about to close. Probably no one this time either. Once the half-year period is up, we'll have to withdraw! This cursed place, those soul-drilling worms are too dangerous. Why set the passage here..."

"Nonsense, this place is safe. Should it be set in the Immortal Demon Dojo?"

"......"

The two chatted, not having much to talk about, just breaking the silence in this perilous place, exchanging words to stave off fear.

"Liushan, do you think our human race still has hope? Even Marquis Minshan has fallen... the more I think about it, the more hopeless it seems!"

"Dubing, stop with the defeatist talk. The marquis said, once the Upper Realm opens, the Hundred Battle King will return, and we'll have hope..."

"Hundred Battle King... alright, let's hope so!"

With some uncertainty and some dejection.

Can it really be?

The last tide left them in despair.

But the Hundred Battle King was their only hope and spiritual support.

Knowing full well that the Hundred Battle King had been defeated once, squandering a great opportunity, yet they had no choice but to rely on him. Those ancient marquises knew the situation, but what could they do?

Without giving people a glimmer of hope, could they rely on the few Daofuse experts now to contend with the myriad races?

In these difficult times, they could only establish a spiritual pillar for the human race.

Don't despair!

Chapter 718: A Glimmer of Hope

In the Upper Realm, the Human Race clung to a fragile hope. Even if this hope seemed unreliable, strength was still on their side. This was the sentiment among the humans of the Upper Realm. They knew that the Hundred Battle King wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but he was undeniably powerful!

In their current state of despair, having a strong figure still alive was better than having no hope at all. It had to be said that the Hundred Battle King had his merits. Because he was still alive, the remaining humans had the confidence to continue resisting. Otherwise, they would have either surrendered or betrayed their cause. The fact that they had endured until now was largely due to the name of the Hundred Battle King.

These two individuals shared the same sentiment, holding onto a sliver of hope mixed with a lack of confidence. They had lost the last battle; could they succeed this time? Who cared! At least the Hundred Battle King was still alive, wasn't he?

As they conversed, Liu Shan suddenly said, "Hmm? There's movement..."

"What?"

"Stay quiet!"

At that moment, a ghostly laugh echoed, and the two were momentarily dazed. In the next instant, a playful voice whispered in their ears, "Don't move, little darlings, you're so much fun!"

In an instant, dozens of figures appeared. The two widened their eyes, unable to move, as a pair of small hands gripped their necks. In that moment, even their paths were completely sealed off!

Soon, a white-haired youth appeared before them. The youth frowned slightly and waved his hand, causing countless small light dots to appear in the cave. Su Yu looked disdainful and said, "What are these things, so many little bugs!"

"Soul-Drilling Worms!" At that moment, Grandstar spoke up, suddenly opening his mouth and swallowing countless worms. He burped contentedly and laughed, "Not bad tasting!"

He was not human but a fish-headed creature. At this moment, he seemed quite pleased as he devoured the worms.

This scene left Liu Shan and the other man utterly shocked. Who were these people? No, it seemed there were non-humans among them! Were these people human or from the myriad races? They couldn't tell, as there seemed to be both humans and non-humans among them.

Su Yu ignored Grandstar and quickly assessed the situation. "We should still be in the Burial Soul Mountain. It doesn't seem to have moved. Weren't Soul-Drilling Worms supposed to be dangerous?"

Su Yu found it odd. Zhao Chuan had said this place was extremely dangerous. The Soul-Drilling Worms were supposed to be terrifying! Terrifying, my foot! They weren't scary at all. He had thought these little bugs were something fearsome, but they were just these things?

He then looked at the two captives and smiled, "Two Eternals, both at the seventh stage, not bad! Lantian, capture them and control them. Let's leave this place and interrogate them later!"

"Alright!" Lantian chuckled, grabbing the two like they were little chicks. As he walked, he said, "We've arrived, and it doesn't seem much different up here. Just two little kids guarding the passage. One punch and they're dead. I thought there'd be a Daofuse Realm to fight."

Su Yu laughed, "What's the rush? We've just arrived!"

"True!" Lantian nodded, chuckling, "They say there are only six Daofuse Realm humans up here. Why not capture them all first and consolidate our strength? These two are probably under Marquis Dingjun. Should I go capture Marquis Dingjun?"

"No rush!" Su Yu stepped out of the cave, sensing the surroundings, and smiled, "The place is alright, no living people! Just a lot of bugs. Great Ming King, set up a formation to keep the bugs out; they're annoying."

"Understood!" The Great Ming King said no more and quickly went to find a place to set up a formation.

At this moment, the two captured Eternals were horrified. These people... were they human? The Great Ming King... they didn't recognize him, but they knew of the Ming King! Were they really this strong? Capturing six Daofuse Realm... capturing Marquis Dingjun? Were they joking, or were they serious?

The two were utterly terrified. They were high-stage Eternals, yet they were captured without even realizing it. What a terrifying group of people! Were these people really from the Lower Realm? For a moment, the two were in a daze.
