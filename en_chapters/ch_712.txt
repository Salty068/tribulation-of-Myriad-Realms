Chapter 712: Chain Reaction

The fall of six Daofuse Realm experts from the Dragon Race, the annihilation of a million dragons, and the destruction of Dragon City spread like a whirlwind across the Upper Realm.

It was shocking!

And terrifying.

If such a powerful race as the Dragon Race could be ambushed, what about the other races? Apart from the God, Demon, and Immortal Races, weren't all other races in danger?

...

In the south.

The Divine Fire Mountain region.

At this moment, countless volcanoes erupted, and Daofuse Realm experts were gradually arriving at the outskirts of Divine Fire Mountain, preparing for the siege in a few days. However, when Marquis Blood Severing left and the news of the near-extinction of the Dragon Race reached them, the gathered experts could no longer sit still.

The larger races could manage, but the smaller races were in complete disarray!

At this moment, Bajue was overseeing the situation.

As the news spread, Bajue frowned, waiting for Marquis Blood Severing's return.

Suddenly, a Daofuse expert from the Nether Race approached swiftly, speaking in a deep voice, "Marquis Bajue, my race has sent word for me to return immediately. We fear we cannot participate in this battle!"

Bajue's expression changed slightly.

The newcomer quickly explained, "It's not that we are unwilling to contribute, but our race is near the Chaos Mountain region. Now that the Dragon Race is in trouble, our Lord of Nether Waters fears we might be next. Therefore, the Nether Race needs to retract its defenses, and I must return to support my race!"

Bajue felt a bit irritable.

He understood that the current situation was unstable, but he believed that since they had already gathered, they shouldn't give up halfway.

"Lord of Sacred Nether Dao, the enemy might just be trying to disrupt our plans by attacking the Dragon Race to distract us from Divine Fire Mountain..."

The Lord of Sacred Nether Dao nodded but sighed, "Even so... Divine Fire Mountain is not as important as the safety of my race! A single Marquis Huoyun is not worth the life and death of my people."

Bajue's thoughts were understandable.

However, the Lord of Sacred Nether Dao had no choice. Was it more important to kill Marquis Huoyun or to defend his race? The answer was obvious.

Bajue frowned, "Perhaps we should wait and see. Marquis Blood Severing might launch a siege..."

"We can't wait!"

The Lord of Sacred Nether Dao said firmly, "Marquis Bajue, our race... is not like the God, Demon, and Immortal Races. We are in greater danger without a Daofuse expert!"

It's easy for you to talk when you're not the one at risk!

Of course, you're not worried. Even if there are many people here, your territories are still filled with countless experts.

We can't afford that luxury!

Bajue wanted to say more, but at that moment, a giant dragon didn't even bother to ask him and directly flew away.

Of the nine Dragon Cities, one belonged to the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, and another's owner was here.

As for the dragons from the Dao Source Land, they wouldn't come to establish a dojo anymore.

This dragon expert had just confirmed the news.

Ignoring Bajue's concerns, it flew away.

Seeing this, Bajue said nothing. He could persuade others, but persuading the Dragon Race... they might see you as an enemy, a conspirator!

The dragon flew away, and soon, other experts from various races arrived one after another.

Except for the God and Immortal Races, experts from all races came. Although they hadn't spoken yet, Bajue already knew their intentions.

Bajue felt a bit irritable, wanting to curse, but ultimately restrained himself, saying in a low voice, "Be careful on your way. It's best to leave together to avoid being ambushed!"

"Thank you, Marquis Bajue!"

Five or six Daofuse experts left one after another.

If he persuaded them further, they would become enemies.

After they all left, moments later, the God and Immortal Races arrived.

Bajue, annoyed, asked, "Are you leaving too?"

A strong expert from the Immortal Race chuckled, "We're not in a hurry. It's normal for others to leave. There's no need to be angry. When it concerns the survival of a race, who wouldn't be anxious?"

He continued, "I'm just wondering if we should continue with the siege."

"If it's just our three races, Divine Fire Mountain is vast and dangerous..."

Bajue frowned, "Wait a moment. Marquis Blood Severing should return soon."

Whether to continue or not, he couldn't say.

Divine Fire Mountain itself was very dangerous. Here, Marquis Huoyun was a top-tier Daofuse expert. Using the unique terrain and power of Divine Fire Mountain, he could even contend with Heavenly King-level experts.

Without support from other races, it wasn't impossible to fight.

But if they fought, they feared casualties among the races.

As he pondered, the void trembled, and Marquis Blood Severing returned.

At this moment, Marquis Blood Severing glanced around, noticing that many had left, leaving only the God, Demon, and Immortal Races, along with himself, totaling eleven Daofuse experts.

One quasi-king, ten Daofuse experts.

Not too surprising, just a bit depressed.

Reinforcements wouldn't arrive anytime soon.

Even the Demon Race's homeland wouldn't send reinforcements.

The council was urgently summoning him back to discuss the near-extinction of the Dragon Race.

The enemy came with overwhelming force, using the annihilation of the Dragon Race as a deterrent, a shocking move. The Demon Race council now needed him to return to discuss countermeasures and assess the combat strength of this newly emerged Chaos Race.

"My lord!"

Everyone looked at Marquis Blood Severing, who glanced at Divine Fire Mountain, frowned, and after a long pause, said, "You all should know by now. Do you think this attack on the Dragon Race is another way to rescue Marquis Huoyun? If we continue the siege, will they come to Divine Fire Mountain?"

Everyone fell silent; it was hard to judge.

Of course, the timing was coincidental.

Marquis Blood Severing sighed and continued, "Marquis Huoyun's range of movement has been compressed to a small area!"

He pointed to a region in Divine Fire Mountain where a series of volcanic eruptions occurred, indicating about a dozen peaks. Marquis Blood Severing said solemnly, "He must be hiding in one of these peaks. Just a dozen small peaks. If we encircle and consume them bit by bit, he will soon have nowhere to escape!"

They were on the verge of completely besieging Marquis Huoyun, but now, the incident with the Dragon Race had made him extremely angry.

At this time, an elderly Daofuse expert from the God Race spoke softly, "Marquis Blood Severing, if we must attack, it's not impossible. The fear is that Marquis Huoyun will fight to the death, triggering the entire Divine Fire Mountain, which could result in some losses."

Divine Fire Mountain was well-suited for Marquis Huoyun.

If triggered, it might kill Daofuse experts, possibly more than one.

He continued, "My race has sent word, hoping to convene a Myriad Race council to discuss the Chaos Mountain issue. If we suffer heavy losses at Divine Fire Mountain, it might interfere with plans against Chaos Mountain. There are quite a few Daofuse ancient beasts there."

Marquis Blood Severing frowned, and the God Race expert added, "We know the details of the Human Race. The known is not scary; the fear is the unknown enemy! If we must choose between attacking Chaos Mountain and Divine Fire Mountain... even if the losses are greater at Chaos Mountain, we should prioritize it!"

Marquis Blood Severing sighed deeply and nodded, "You're right! You've probably received messages to return, haven't you?"

"Yes."

"Go!"

Marquis Blood Severing waved his hand, and the strong experts of the God and Immortal Races said no more, as their races had indeed sent messages for them to return.

Soon, six Daofuse experts from both sides left swiftly.

Bajue felt a bit helpless, "My lord, we... this..."

"Abandon it!"

Marquis Blood Severing glanced at Divine Fire Mountain and said solemnly, "They don't want to fight here. Should our race act alone? Marquis Huoyun is not weak. Even I might not suppress him in Divine Fire Mountain!"

He continued, "Let's return. This place... doesn't need to be guarded to prevent being broken through! Next, the races might clear out Chaos Mountain!"

Bajue gasped, "Are we going to act against Chaos Mountain?"

"Depends on the situation; we still lack some necessary intelligence!"

Marquis Blood Severing said solemnly, "As long as we can confirm that those people come from Chaos Mountain, we will act, even if it means losses! We've ignored Chaos Mountain because the ancient beasts there were obedient, staying within the Chaos Mountain region! But now, with the emergence of the Chaos Race, their strength unknown, we cannot let them roam free!"

Marquis Blood Severing said solemnly, "The ones who emerged before haven't acted against the Myriad Races. Everyone tacitly agreed, thinking they were few in number. Now... the near-extinction of the Dragon Race, the death of a quasi-king, has crossed the line! If this lineage isn't resolved, apart from our three races, the other races won't dare to act!"

War was imminent!

Marquis Blood Severing was certain that once it was confirmed that the enemy came from Chaos Mountain, the races would likely unite to eliminate the formidable enemy!

Chaos Mountain had never been of interest before.

But if necessary, the more than twenty Daofuse ancient beasts on the periphery could be dealt with by the Myriad Races!

Bajue said no more about Divine Fire Mountain. Compared to Divine Fire Mountain, Chaos Mountain was the real danger, perilous and filled with countless strong experts.

"My lord, let's withdraw."

Marquis Blood Severing nodded, taking one last look at Divine Fire Mountain, "Let's go. Whether they intended to rescue Marquis Huoyun or not, they succeeded!"

With some helplessness, Marquis Blood Severing waved his hand, quickly leading the retreat.

Whether it was or wasn't.

The core of the Myriad Races was no longer here.

Moreover, if they were ambushed while besieging Marquis Huoyun, it would be even more dangerous.

The other races were unwilling, and the Demon Race didn't want to suffer losses here either.

Soon, the previously gathered group dispersed.

...

At this moment, within Divine Fire Mountain.

A strong expert with fiery red hair suddenly frowned. Around him, a group of Eternal Realm experts, with a mindset of mutual destruction, were discussing how to trigger the entire Divine Fire Mountain, determined to take down these bastards even if it meant their own deaths.

A female Eternal with extremely long hair, like burning flames, said explosively, "My lord, stop hesitating. Two Eternals per group! Guard 22 volcanoes separately. As soon as the enemy arrives, trigger the volcanoes and blow these bastards to hell!"

With that, she stood up, "At worst, we'll perish together. Here, if we die, we can at least kill a few Daofuse experts. Out there, we're worthless!"

"Wait!"

Marquis Huoyun frowned and shouted, "What's the rush!"

He hesitated, "It seems... the ones outside have all left."

The fiery woman snorted, "Feign retreat to catch us off guard? Such a petty trick! My lord, be wary of them launching a surprise attack. We mustn't let our guard down. I suggest we prepare to detonate at any moment!"

"......"

Marquis Huoyun remained silent for a moment, then nodded slightly. It wasn't impossible. Why else would they suddenly withdraw?

After some thought, he said in a deep voice, "Don't rush, and don't be hasty with the detonation. Divine Fire Mountain is our foundation. Without my command, don't act recklessly!"

At this moment, he cautiously probed around and frowned, "They really all left, not a single one stayed."

"They're surely waiting in the shadows for us to show ourselves!"

That was also a possibility.

Marquis Huoyun nodded, "Be careful, everyone. There seemed to be some disturbances outside earlier. Who knows if something major has happened."

"This is called a diversion!"

The woman sneered, "They deliberately caused a commotion to make us think something happened outside, forcing us to retreat. In reality, it's to lower our guard and seize the opportunity to wipe us out!"

It made sense, and Marquis Huoyun nodded with a smile, "You're right, that's a possibility!"

After speaking, he quickly added, "Everyone, be cautious. Scatter for now, don't let them catch us all in one go! I'll continue to observe."

"Understood!"

The crowd dispersed.

Once they left, Marquis Huoyun fell into deep thought.

A ploy? Did they really leave? If this was a strategy, coming and going like this was underestimating him too much. Did they think he was that foolish? Just because they left, he would believe it?

Very strange!

With the myriad races' invasion, he had been prepared to go down with them. Now that they suddenly left, it was troublesome!

"I must extinguish the flames of Huoyun Mountain immediately!"

As if realizing something, he hurriedly rushed towards the magma at the mountain's base. Damn it, the myriad races aren't coming, and the fire below is still burning. If not extinguished soon, Huoyun Mountain will explode.

"Why did they leave so suddenly?"

Marquis Huoyun was helpless. He didn't know if it was a strategy. If it was, and he extinguished Huoyun Mountain now, it would be troublesome to reignite it, as it was the core volcano of Divine Fire Mountain.

"Did the myriad races find out and do this on purpose?"

"Waiting for me to extinguish it, then come to kill me?"

"That would be troublesome!"

Rushing to the base of Huoyun Mountain, Marquis Huoyun hesitated, looking at the volcanic core he had ignited. After some consideration, he gritted his teeth, "I'll wait until it's about to explode before extinguishing it!"

He decided to wait a bit longer.

The myriad races' retreat caught him off guard!

...

The retreat of the myriad races caught not only Marquis Huoyun off guard.

As dawn broke, at the meeting place with Su Yu and his group last night, Shadow Marquis was cautiously lurking, filled with confusion and shock.

Damn!

Weren't we supposed to attack the Nether Race?

Weren't we supposed to meet this morning?

How did the Dragon Race get attacked last night, less than an hour after we parted ways, and nearly wiped out?

What was this?

Were they playing me?

On one hand, he was resentful; on the other, he was shocked by their strength!

They killed a quasi-king and nearly annihilated the Dragon Race.

And they were so decisive, he couldn't believe it.

They said they would attack and did so without hesitation.

The key was, after talking with him for so long, not a single word was true.

Too... too cautious!

He pondered whether this group would show up again.

As he was thinking, a little girl appeared across from him, small and cute, giggling and eating a lollipop, running barefoot on the dangerous outskirts of Chaos Mountain.

Shadow Marquis was intrigued. Who was this?

"Little Shadow Baby, come out!"

Shadow Marquis was slightly startled. Was this the white-haired youth's person?

He slowly revealed himself, and the little girl, a transformation of Lantian, giggled, "Baby, you're here!"

Shadow Marquis was slightly shaken, "Who might you be...?"

"Nameless Number Two!"

"......"

Shadow Marquis was helpless and said, "The Dragon Race incident, was it your doing?"

"Yes, yes."

"Weren't you supposed to attack the Nether Race..."

"Nameless Number One said you're unreliable, a traitor, not to be trusted..."

Shadow Marquis frowned, "You're joking, if I were a traitor, the Human Race might have been wiped out by now."

Lantian giggled, "I don't care, Nameless Number One asked me to pass a message to you, he won't meet you."

"Please, go ahead."

Lantian giggled, "If you're not a traitor, then inform the other Human Race powerhouses of our existence! Arrange a time to meet! We'll notify you when and where! Come if you want, if not, forget it!"

After speaking, she giggled again, "Also, we're not one group, but many factions. You must tell them. Don't trust everyone. Our faction has a secret code for contact. If it's wrong, they're not one of us!"

"What?"

Shadow Marquis was slightly shaken, "What do you mean?"

Lantian giggled, "You're so dumb! We're not one group, don't you get it? There are bad guys and good guys, and we're the good guys! The Human Race isn't just your faction. There are three factions now! Yours, ours, and another bad one, also very powerful!"

Shadow Marquis was deeply shaken, "You mean, there are many more Humans?"

"Of course!"

Lantian giggled, "And your faction is the weakest! Only a few Daofuse, so pitiful! The bad faction has many powerful figures, even several quasi-kings! Anyway, don't consider us one group... if you're the bad guys, then your faction is doomed, but that's not our concern. I've told you! The contact code is simple, if someone says, 'I love candy,' then they're one of us!"

Shadow Marquis quickly memorized it, feeling shaken, and hurriedly asked, "Friend, where does the other faction come from?"

"Not telling you!"

Lantian giggled and quickly disappeared.

Shadow Marquis tried to track her, but after a while, she was completely gone.

He was left in shock. What a powerful figure, even a clone was so formidable.

Who were these people?

Three factions, with his being the weakest.

Shadow Marquis felt heavy-hearted.

Even he was troubled by the situation.

Where did this sudden group of powerhouses come from?

How many more were hidden?

"With so many Dragon Race powerhouses dead, are these people really helping us?"

Thoughts raced through his mind, and Shadow Marquis quickly vanished from the spot.

This place was no longer safe; he sensed many powerful figures from the myriad races nearby.

This time, Chaos Mountain might be in trouble.

...

Dao Origin Mountain.

In a cave, Lantian chuckled, "Done! That guy left."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Marquis Dingjun hesitated, "Emperor Yu, why not bring him in too?"

Su Yu smiled, "Not everyone is as reliable as you!"

Marquis Dingjun was slightly moved. Was this... a sign of trust?

For a moment, he felt a bit excited.

Su Yu smiled, "Shadow has always been acting outside. Who knows his situation? The same goes for the others! I'd rather not bring someone unreliable in."

Marquis Dingjun thought for a moment and nodded, "True, but this way, their days might be tough."

Suddenly, he realized his own days were quite good.

This time, it was truly satisfying.

They killed six Dragon Race Daofuse, and it was so exhilarating.

With so many Daofuse dead, even if some survived, there wouldn't be many left.

Losing more than half was inevitable.

The key was, except for himself, almost no one else was injured. With such a price, they killed a Heavenly King, it was worth it!

Moreover, on their side, his subordinate Chongming also reached Daofuse this time, adding another Daofuse combatant.

At this moment, Su Yu was roasting meat over a fire, eating dragon meat, and smiling, "Next, the myriad races will probably quiet down for a while. Their main target will likely be Chaos Mountain. Chaos Mountain... might not be peaceful. Dao Origin Mountain can't be stayed at for long!"

Su Yu smiled, "Let's watch the tigers fight from the mountain! Our origin from the lower realm is the most secretive matter. Even if the Control King's lineage feels tricked, they have to wonder who tricked them."

The Great Zhou King said softly, "They might guess something, after all, this grand formation came from the West King's Consort."

Su Yu nodded, "That's possible! But, would you have them explain to the myriad races? The myriad races have seen their existence, will they listen to explanations? Even if they know they've been schemed against, so what?"

Su Yu smiled, "On one side is the lower realm Human Race, on the other is the Control King's lineage hidden for ten thousand years. How will the myriad races choose?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and smiled, "The lower realm can't be dealt with now, and its strength isn't as great as the Control King's lineage. Of course, they'd attack the strong, not the weak. The lower realm can be dealt with, but the Control King's lineage is not easy to handle!"

Lantian chuckled, "Don't be too complacent, be careful they join forces to wipe out the lower realm first, then settle their score!"

Su Yu nodded, "That's a possibility! Anything is possible! If they reach an agreement, and one side sends three to five Heavenly Kings to deal with the lower realm first, that would be a huge problem for us!"

Su Yu smiled, "These guys are also worried about us reaping the benefits. But a tripartite balance is stronger than a two-power struggle! Three legs are stable! They fear each other. If it really doesn't work, why wait for them to join forces first?"

The others were slightly taken aback.

Su Yu smiled, "If it comes to that, we'll use the billions of lives in the lower realm as a pledge, and first join forces with the myriad races to take down the Control King's lineage!"

Su Yu chuckled, "In the Upper Realm, the number of various races is not small! But in the Lower Realm, there are even more! Even if the gods, demons, and immortals don't care, do you think the other races won't? As long as we control the Lower Realm, we still have the advantage! There's no need to worry too much."

The others thought for a moment and nodded slightly.

Marquis Dingjun, however, seemed a bit uncomfortable and said in a deep voice, "Emperor Yu, why can't we first join forces with the Control King's lineage to deal with the myriad races?"

Teaming up with the myriad races to deal with the Control King's lineage was something he found hard to accept.

Su Yu smiled, "Don't consider the Control King's lineage as part of the Human Race; just treat them as another race! Of course, we should first eliminate the strongest race! The Control King's lineage is more terrifying and troublesome than the myriad races! As for being of the same race... don't take it too seriously. This lineage is all mixed blood, mixed with the Demon Emperor's blood. Do you still take it seriously?"

"Mixed blood?"

Marquis Dingjun was taken aback, "Mixed blood?"

"Of course!"

The next moment, Marquis Dingjun cursed, "All mixed blood should die!"

Yes, these old relics were like that.

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to say more. Just mentioning mixed blood was enough to anger these old relics.

Sure enough, the next moment, Marquis Dingjun had no more objections, gritting his teeth, "Mixed blood should be exterminated. Our Human Race's bloodline is noble, and the Control King's lineage dares to have mixed blood. They should all die!"

Fight them!

Even if it meant joining forces with the myriad races, it was worth it.

At least the myriad races were open enemies, while mixed blood was unforgivable!

"......"

Everyone was speechless, rolling their eyes.

The old guy changed his stance really fast.

Su Yu also laughed and quickly said, "Let's not talk about this. These are matters for the future! The current priority is that if the myriad races reach a consensus to deal with Chaos Mountain, honestly, the outskirts of Chaos Mountain won't be able to hold them off! Not only that, if the myriad races launch a surprise attack, these ancient beasts, lacking intelligence, are doomed!"

Su Yu continued, "Moreover, the Control King's lineage has some who cultivate the power of chaos. Even those who haven't cultivated it have shielding formations at their disposal. This is certain, so in Chaos Mountain, the myriad races might not be able to defeat them!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Ming King, "Can you research a way to break this sealing formation?"

The Great Ming King took a deep breath, "You mean..."

Su Yu smiled, "At a critical moment, break the Control King's lineage's formation. We can't let them take all the advantage, can we?"

The Great Ming King frowned, "This is not easy to break! Of course, there's no formation in the world that can't be broken! There must be a way, but I need more time to research it, and it might not yield results in the short term."

"No rush for now. The myriad races wanting to deal with Chaos Mountain is not something that can be done overnight."

Su Yu smiled, "Let's not talk about this for now. Next, we need to evacuate this place. Lantian, send a message to Xia Longwu and the others, telling them not to return to Chaos Mountain. They might have thought of it as their lair, but now it seems they need to find a new place!"

Lantian nodded.

The Great Zhou King asked, "Then what should we do next?"

Everyone looked at Su Yu. Here, Su Yu was still the one in charge.

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "My goal is simple. This time, I want to take a look at the Land of Daoyuan... Of course, it's very dangerous, and I might not necessarily go! Secondly, I want to meet our allies in the Upper Realm!"

Everyone looked at him, and even Jiuyue stopped hiccuping and looked at Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled, "Jiuyue, you heard right. I'm planning to meet our allies, starting with the Iron Devourer Race!"

"How many Daofuse experts does your Iron Devourer Race have in the Upper Realm?"

Jiuyue immediately said, "As far as I know, there are three. Now, I'm not sure! In April and May, there was also Marquis Giant Bamboo. They were alive before, and it seems they haven't died. If they had, we would have sensed it..."

Three Daofuse experts, not weak at all.

The Hou Race reportedly had two Daofuse experts in the Upper Realm before, but one died, leaving only one.

Of course, these people were talking about the last tide. If any Daofuse experts were born later, they might not know.

If they didn't follow a path, it would be even harder to know.

The Five Elemental Race didn't even have a single Daofuse expert in the Upper Realm.

The Iron Devourer Race's strength wasn't weak. If they had Daofuse experts stationed in the Lower Realm, their strength wasn't too weak.

Over the years, the Iron Devourer Race might have even birthed more Daofuse experts.

Of course, these are just speculations.

Su Yu squinted his eyes and asked, "If I persuade your race to move from the Upper Realm to the Lower Realm with me, is that possible?"

Jiuyue said honestly, "I'm not sure, but there should be hope! Our race in the Upper Realm shouldn't be numerous. We don't reproduce as fast as dragons and phoenixes. The Dragon Race has reproduced for so many years and only has a million beings. Our race might have even fewer, only tens of thousands... If we really need to evacuate, it's not impossible."

Su Yu stroked his chin. If he could bring down three Daofuse experts from the Iron Devourer Race, even if they hadn't birthed more Daofuse experts over the years, they would have a total of five Daofuse experts!

Meeting allies and reaching a consensus with some strong figures in the Upper Realm was also the purpose of Su Yu bringing Jiuyue and the others this time.

It's impossible to keep avoiding them.

At this time, Marquis Dingjun couldn't help but interject, "Emperor Yu, since you can meet with the Iron Devourer Race, why not meet with Marquis Huoyun and the others?"

After all, they are our own people!

Su Yu said indifferently, "I told Shadow to inform the others. Whether they meet or not is up to them, not me! Do I have to force a meeting?"

You forced a meeting with me!

Marquis Dingjun thought, saying it as if you didn't force a meeting with me.

Despite thinking this, he didn't say anything more. He just considered it and said, "The Iron Devourer Race, Marquis Giant Bamboo of this race, once helped me. However..."

He looked at Su Yu, then at Jiuyue, hesitated for a moment, and said, "However, the May Dao Master of this race is not very friendly to the Human Race."

Su Yu thought for a moment and sneered, "That's normal! A Daofuse expert entrusted his son to you, and within three days, he was killed in battle. If it were me, I'd turn around and hit you. Wouldn't that be normal?"

Jiuyue said dryly, "Emperor Yu, the one who died in battle... was my grandfather, July!"

You remembered wrong!

Su Yu was taken aback, then quickly said helplessly, "Wasn't it said that the May Dao Master's son also died in battle? During the third tide."

"Yes!"

Jiuyue thought for a moment and nodded, "Yes, during the third tide, the son of the May ancestor also died in battle. After that, my great-grandfather June took over the Iron Devourer Race."

Su Yu secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Got it mixed up!

Your race's names... I have to admit, they're confusing.

In the ninth tide, it was July who died in battle, but the son of May also died in the third tide. Anyway, it's not surprising that May is hostile to the Human Race.

And Marquis Dingjun, at this moment, appeared slightly embarrassed and explained, "July's death was... something we didn't anticipate."

He still explained a bit, "At that time, the situation was quite chaotic, and... and that July didn't say he was a prince when he came to the Human Race. We all thought he was just an ordinary Eternal from the Iron Devourer Race... It wasn't until he died in battle that we found out he was a descendant of June..."

Su Yu said irritably, "Even if he was an ordinary Eternal, the Iron Devourer Race participated in the war, and you got him killed in three days?"

"......"

No words to counter.

Marquis Dingjun sighed and only after a long pause did he say, "Actually, we reflected on it after the fact. But at that time, we were too complacent, thinking that without the myriad races, the Human Race could also defeat the myriad races... As a result, we harmed our allies and ourselves!"

It was also the battle of the ninth tide that caused heavy losses to the Human Race's allies, leading to this tide, before Su Yu, almost no myriad races dared to help the Human Race.

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him and quickly said, "As for the Iron Devourer Race, since Marquis Giant Bamboo once helped you, it means they still have the intention to help the Human Race..."

Su Yu asked, "How strong is Marquis Giant Bamboo?"

"How strong are the April and May Dao Masters?"

Marquis Dingjun thought for a moment and said, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, being able to be titled a marquis, naturally isn't weak. The last time I saw him, he had about second-class Daofuse strength. Now, I'm not too sure. As for April and May, both had about third-class Daofuse strength before, similar to my strength..."

Saying this, he hesitated for a moment and said, "The Iron Devourer Race's March might still be alive!"

Jiuyue looked at him in confusion.

Marquis Dingjun explained, "January was the emperor of your race and disappeared with the ancients! February also disappeared during that period..."

"Died!"

Su Yu said calmly, "He was probably killed by the Control King!"

"......"

No words.

Marquis Dingjun had no choice but to continue, "March was actually alive after the ancients, but not long after, he also disappeared. However, there was no news of his fall, so I suspect March might still be alive, possibly in the Land of Daoyuan! Specifically, the Land of Daoyuan has many powers of laws, and if hidden, it's hard to find."

Marquis Dingjun continued, "If March is alive, then March definitely has the combat power of a Heavenly King!"

Jiuyue asked in confusion, "Is he really alive? If he were alive, during the last tide, when our race's strong descended, they didn't mention it."

"This is just my thought, not sure, but the Iron Devourer Race has helped us, and the gods and demons are quite wary of them, never attacking the Iron Devourer Race, which speaks volumes!"

Marquis Dingjun explained, "The Iron Devourer Race is an ally of the Human Race, and the gods, demons, and immortals know this. Over the years, they haven't attacked the Iron Devourer Race, so I suspect maybe March appeared, causing some fear among the races. Otherwise, they should have dealt with the Iron Devourer Race long ago."

Su Yu nodded slightly and smiled, "Alive is best!"

After speaking, he smiled again, "Therefore, the Iron Devourer Race is still a must-visit, absolutely necessary!"

After saying that, he stroked his chin, "With Jiuyue here, meeting them shouldn't be difficult, but getting them to fully side with us... won't be easy."

Jiuyue said honestly, "Emperor Yu, I can persuade them!"

He chuckled, "In the Lower Realm, our race has already become an ally of the Human Race. The news just hasn't been passed up yet. Once it is, there's really no other choice!"

Su Yu smiled, "Hard to say! Anyway, we have to try!"

Meeting allies to strengthen our side, and then, perhaps, I still need to meddle in the affairs of Chaos Mountain.

Su Yu thought for a moment and added, "Later, I still have to go down and finish off Marquis Tianlong and the others!"

Su Yu stood amidst a group of people, a smile playing on his lips. "Perhaps I'll make another trip to the Lower Realm to recruit more experts. It's bustling up here, with so many powerful beings. I enjoy the chaos, and now is the perfect time to fish in troubled waters."

Marquis Dingjun hesitated before asking, "Emperor Yu, how many Daofuse Realm experts are left in the Lower Realm?"

Su Yu glanced at him, chuckling. "Not many, and not many stronger than you. There's Director Wan, Guardian Hongmeng, the Great Qin King, the Great Xia King, Doubao, Fat Ball, the Fate Emperor Wuming, and a few Death Marquis... The rest are probably a bit weaker than you."

Marquis Dingjun's face fell, speechless. Not many stronger than him, yet Su Yu had listed quite a few. It seemed his strength ranked only after the top ten even in the Lower Realm.

Su Yu wasn't exaggerating, but he didn't dwell on it. Stroking his chin, he mused, "If we bring too many from the Lower Realm, it might cause trouble. Let's see. If necessary, we can take out the Phoenix Emperor and the others first."

"Enough of that. The best solution is for Guardian Xiaguang and the others to reach the Daofuse Realm. That way, we can free up some Daofuse combat power."

Su Yu was determined to intervene in the chaos of Chaos Mountain. If the two sides didn't clash, all his efforts would be in vain. Ideally, he could infiltrate the Myriad Races' ranks and help them locate the Control King's lineage. Su Yu needed to probe their depths.

"The Control King's lineage..." Su Yu murmured, then suddenly laughed. "The Control King killed February. Maybe someone knows about it. If so, I might use that as an excuse to join the forces against the Control King's lineage, like the Iron Devourer Race..."

He glanced at Jiuyue, who grinned foolishly. "Don't look at me. I don't have a say in the Upper Realm."

Ignoring him, Su Yu quickly stood up. "No time to waste. Pack up and evacuate! Also, leave everything here untouched. This mountain is on the outskirts. If the Myriad Races come to sweep through, they might discover this mountain. Someone might even find the formation here, which would confirm that the Control King's lineage is indeed within Chaos Mountain!"

"Let them see the formation. Maybe they'll find a way to break it, destroying the Control King's foothold here!"

"Great Ming King, leave some traces to lead them to the Control King's lineage!"

"Understood!" Great Ming King nodded.

Soon, the group packed their belongings, restoring the place to how it looked when Marquis Anbei was here. Su Yu emerged from the cave, glancing back at the depths of Chaos Mountain with a smile. He hoped the Control King's lineage was strong. If they were too weak, the Myriad Races wouldn't care, and that would be a problem. The stronger, the better! The stronger they were, the more the Myriad Races would fear them!

At the same time, deep within Chaos Mountain, several towering mountains formed an enormous canyon. From above, the canyon appeared normal, with no anomalies. Yet within the canyon, there were faint traces of formations. Beneath this formation lay an entire kingdom!

Countless humans! Even small cities had sprung up. Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years was enough to change many things, enough to turn a thousand people into a billion, or perhaps lead to complete extinction. But here, in this paradise, the population only grew.

At this moment, a low voice echoed from within a grand hall, "Investigate! Who went out?"

"Ancestor..."

"Quickly! I want to know if anyone left!"

A cold voice from the hall, tinged with displeasure, continued, "Something happened outside Chaos Mountain. It seems one of ours attacked the Dragon Race!"

"This..."

"Hurry and investigate!"

"Yes!"

Quickly, someone went to check if a powerful individual had left. Meanwhile, the voice's owner in the hall was filled with anger. Damn it! Did one of theirs go out? It wasn't time to be careless, so how could they act so recklessly? Attacking the Dragon Race would alert the Myriad Races. Which fool did this?

With so many powerful beings in the clan, not all were present. He couldn't be sure if it was one of theirs without checking each one. Only then would he know the situation.

"Foolish thing!" he cursed, the voice fading. If he found out who did it, he wouldn't let them off!
