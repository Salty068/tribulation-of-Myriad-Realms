Chapter 675: Subduing the South Heavenly King Was Too Easy

Accompanying the Old Turtle on a journey through the River of Time, Su Yu found that it didn't consume much of his energy. He hadn't really given the Old Turtle any guidance, nor would he force the Old Turtle to change his path. The Old Turtle knew his own issues, and as long as there wasn't too much conflict, it was more comfortable to stick to one path rather than opening a new one. The Lazy Turtle was unlikely to blaze his own trail!

...

After arranging for a new guardian, Su Yu left the Book Spirit and the Tea Plant in Grand Dream City. With this, Grand Dream City gathered a significant amount of Daofuse combat power. The Great Xia King, the Great Qin King, Heavendoom, Tian Yue, the Old Turtle, and the Great Ming King, who was still researching formations outside, were all present. If the Great Ming King also succeeded in Daofuse, the number of Daofuse experts here would reach ten. Anyone daring to attack Grand Dream City now... Su Yu would have to pray for them. Unless they were a master of laws, even the Four Heavenly Kings would have to kneel.

Meanwhile, Su Yu, along with 27 petrified guardians, entered the Death Realm. These guardians were not weak, and they had all drawn their weapons. Among them, six were at the ninth stage of the Eternal Realm, fourteen at the eighth stage, and the remaining seven at the seventh stage. With such strength, they could hold their own against four or five Daofuse experts. In theory, four or five Daofuse experts could contend with a Heavenly King. However, this equation didn't hold. If these Eternals faced a Heavenly King, they would likely be slapped to death in no time!

...

Death Realm.

Upon entering the Death Realm again, Su Yu found the sky as gloomy as ever. The passage beneath the ancient city had few undead now. Even if there were any, most were newly born, washed down from the Celestial River of Death, wandering aimlessly. They were weak, with hardly any Sunmoon Realm undead among them.

Of course, the entire Spirit Suppression Domain still had an invincible ruler, at the passage of Grandstar Ancient City. There, as always, stood a solitary fortress. The invincible rulers guarding other passages had been taken away, except for Xingyue. She refused to leave, and no one sought her out. Even Hetu didn't bother with Xingyue. They all knew Xingyue was Su Yu's converted ruler. Currently, Xingyue's strength wasn't particularly formidable. Su Yu often borrowed death energy from various cities, yet their death energy channel remained uncut. Su Yu could sever it, but he hadn't. He still wanted to try resurrection.

Previously, he had comprehended the "life" character, but now the power of characters had been extracted, mainly the power of the pen dao. Su Yu might not be able to resurrect anyone, especially since even the Culture King had failed. He decided to observe the situation further before making any moves.

Xingyue didn't want to go to the East King's Residence, and Su Yu didn't press the issue. He assigned Zhou Potian to guard Grandstar Ancient City. The Zhou family was smart, and Su Yu didn't say much, as long as they didn't clash with Xingyue.

"Your Majesty!"

Not long after Su Yu arrived, a powerful figure quickly approached—it was Lanshan Hou. Su Yu was a bit surprised and looked at Lanshan Hou. "Why are you here?"

"I was just about to come here to meet the Spirit Suppression General!" Lanshan Hou glanced at the guardians behind Su Yu, nodding slightly at some she recognized. She quickly said, "Your Majesty, the Celestial River of Death has been slightly turbulent recently. In the past, it took a long time for a ruler to revive, but recently, over ten undead rulers have revived in the East King's region alone!"

"Any undead marquises?"

Su Yu asked.

Lanshan Hou quickly replied, "None have been discovered yet, but there should be some! However, undead marquises are different from undead rulers. When an undead ruler revives, they retain at most ten percent of their memory and need time to recover, often appearing dull. But when an undead marquis revives, they recover at least fifty percent of their memory, making them far more intelligent than undead rulers."

"Undead rulers are instinctively driven to leave the Celestial River of Death, while undead marquises might remain hidden within the river!"

Su Yu nodded. Last time, he sensed the revival of an undead marquis, but it hadn't emerged. As expected, these beings were quite intelligent. In contrast, the ruler-level ones were like fools upon revival. Take Xia Chen, for instance; it took him a long time to recover some memories. Without devouring the Culture King's Order, it might have taken him many more years to regain his memories.

Speaking of which, Xia Chen should have left with Liu Hong. That rascal Liu Hong had some skills, managing to coax Xia Chen away. Even Hetu was unaware of the situation, and Xia Chen disappeared with Liu Hong.

"So, you're looking for Hongmeng..."

"I wanted to ask if he would accompany me to the Celestial River of Death to assess the situation and prevent any disturbances!" Lanshan Hou said solemnly, "Undead marquises are manageable, but the fear is that some ancient beings might revive! We just conquered the Death Realm, and a top-tier Heavenly King-level expert might emerge! With two Heavenly Kings dead, the Death Realm might produce another Heavenly King!"

With two Heavenly King-level experts dead, a portion of the great path was vacated, enough to support the emergence of a new Heavenly King, or even two, given that many undead marquises had also perished. Recently, Lanshan Hou felt her strength increasing rapidly because the great path had opened up!

One carrot, one pit. Su Yu's actions had caused turmoil in the undead great path, clearing out many beings and killing numerous undead marquises. With some luck, three new undead Heavenly Kings might emerge.

Su Yu nodded slightly. This was indeed possible. However, even with this possibility, he couldn't just stop fighting. The newly emerged undead marquises or even Heavenly Kings might be from the Human Race, after all. Even if they weren't, it wouldn't be worse than the current situation.

"Let's go, check out the East King's Domain first!" Su Yu smiled. "There's no helping it. The Celestial River of Death has existed for too long. Who knows how many powerful beings and monsters are buried within! You should cultivate more. Last battle, you devoured so many undead imprints. Advance to Heavenly King soon."

Lanshan Hou smiled sheepishly. She had devoured them, but her strength hadn't increased as expected. Merging with the great path, even the undead great path, required talent and comprehension. It wasn't just about devouring!

Unfortunately, she wasn't among the top-tier geniuses. Warriors often had this issue, while cultural researchers had a deeper understanding of the great path. Lanshan Hou, in ancient times, was a fierce general, not a wise one.

Seeing her silence, Su Yu sighed. Understood! Compared to Lanshan Hou advancing to Heavenly King, Hetu might have more hope. Su Yu was contemplating whether to have the Old Turtle lift Hetu's seal. The Old Turtle hoped for Hetu's resurrection. But Su Yu thought that if Hetu didn't resurrect, he might already be an undead marquis by now. This guy was quite clever. If Hetu were an undead marquis, devouring a large number of treasures might indeed allow him to advance to Heavenly King.

Relying on resurrection, who knows how long that would take? By the time the great war ended, Hetu might not have resurrected, still an Eternal seventh-stage undead.

As Su Yu pondered, the Old Turtle's sigh suddenly reached his ears. "Emperor Yu, if Hetu has his own ideas, you can unseal him. I wish for his resurrection... but... I know it's like the moon in the water. In the past, the Culture King failed to resurrect anyone, let alone me."

Su Yu had to admit, the Old Turtle was quite formidable, sensing his thoughts? Forget it, better to ask Hetu himself. The stronger the power, the harder the resurrection, that's inevitable!

"Resurrection... South Heavenly King..." Did the Culture King attempt resurrection here, and did the South Heavenly King know? If so, did the South Heavenly King know how to resurrect?

"Hetu was close to the Daofuse Realm before his death. Once unsealed, he might quickly step into Daofuse. If he gains some benefits during the Northern King's demise, he might not become a Heavenly King, but he could become a top-tier Daofuse combatant..."

With these thoughts, Su Yu quickly said, "Let's go to the East King's Residence!"

"Yes!"

The group responded, and Lanshan Hou quickly followed, a bit excited. Walking beside Su Yu, she hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, everything is stable in the East King's Domain now. I've already arranged for people to take over the West King's Domain! But the distance between the two makes communication difficult unless we break through the South or North King's Domain..."

"What about the South Heavenly King?"

Su Yu asked, and Lanshan Hou immediately replied, "The South Heavenly King hasn't said much, but... she probably wants to meet Your Majesty before making a decision."

At this, Lanshan Hou transmitted, "The South Heavenly King indeed favors the Human Race, but she is proud. If Your Majesty cannot make her submit, she will only be an ally, not a subordinate of the Human Race!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. Understood. The South Heavenly King supports the Human Race, but only the Human Race, not the Human Lord! Simply put, she helps out of respect for the Culture King, but if the Human Lord is incompetent, she will only assist, not truly serve.

Su Yu smiled, having no particular thoughts about it. That's fine. Otherwise, if she helped every Human Lord, the previous tide would have supported the Hundred Battle King, and everything would have been doomed. Even the last bit of foundation would have been lost. Those who didn't help the Hundred Battle King in the previous tide now have the chance to help Su Yu, like the Old Turtle and others. If they had all helped the Hundred Battle King in the previous tide... they would have been doomed!

Once again, Su Yu internally berated the Hundred Battle King, still harboring deep resentment. The fallen king who ruined a great kingdom!

Lanshan Hou, unaware of Su Yu's internal drama, quickly reported, "Your Majesty, also, the Northern King previously sent an envoy. The Northern King wishes to divide the Northern King's Domain as his own fief. He bears no enmity towards the Human Race; otherwise, he would have allied against us long ago! Now, with two Heavenly Kings fallen, the Northern King's strength is actually three points stronger than before. He proposes peace talks!"

"Peace talks?"

Su Yu chuckled, "How can I allow others to snore beside my bed? Is the Northern King a fool, or does he think I'm a fool? Would I leave a disobedient Heavenly King-level expert at my doorstep?"

"Ignore him!"

Su Yu declared, "If they send another envoy, execute them immediately. Tell the North King there is no room for negotiation! Either surrender outright or disperse part of his comprehension of the Great Dao and demote himself to the level of a Necrolord!"

Lan Shan Hou's expression shifted slightly. Such a demand was nearly impossible! That would mean war was inevitable. Even if the North King were to surrender, Su Yu's condition of dispersing his Great Dao power seemed overly idealistic.

"Your Majesty, the North King will never agree to surrender," Lan Shan Hou said.

Su Yu nodded. "I know! But if he maintains his top-tier Heavenly King strength, I'll need a top-tier Heavenly King to keep an eye on him constantly. That's even more dangerous than now. If he pretends to be one of us and then suddenly betrays us, it would be a real disaster. It's better to clearly define friend from foe!"

Lan Shan Hou considered this and nodded slightly. That was indeed true.

The group moved forward swiftly, and Su Yu exuded a faint glow—not of vitality, but of the power of laws. He was dispersing some of the weak power of laws in the area, allowing the Human Lord's fortune to cover certain regions. This would make it easier for the human race or Su Yu's forces to fight in the Death Realm in the future.

"His Majesty is growing stronger!" Lan Shan Hou sighed. Su Yu seemed much more formidable than before, increasingly resembling the Culture King... No, perhaps not quite the same! Lan Shan Hou felt a complex mix of emotions. Previously, Su Yu had indeed been similar to the Culture King, but now, while he seemed even more like him, there was also a distinct difference. Su Yu had gained a certain dominance, lacking the gentleness of the Culture King.

Su Yu paid no mind to these thoughts. Soon, he saw the Celestial River of Death. This river spanned the heavens and earth, encircling all directions, forming a closed loop around the entire Death Realm. But it was more than just that; the Celestial River of Death didn't simply turn the Death Realm into a "return" shape. Su Yu looked up at the sky, realizing that the river resembled a tent! The four sides below were what everyone saw as the river, but the unseen part actually covered the entire realm!

It connected all directions!

"A tent... No, more like a bowl, an upright bowl!" It wasn't an overturned bowl; instead, the edges of the bowl extended outward, covering the entire Death Realm and guiding the deceased strong ones.

The more Su Yu observed, the more astonished he became. He had gained many insights by now. The creator of this Celestial River of Death was likely also the creator of the Death Dao. Could such a powerful being truly die? Who could kill him? The master of the Human Race's physical path would likely have met his end if he encountered this being.

With these thoughts, Su Yu stepped onto the Celestial River of Death. Countless corpses floated in the river, with many more submerged, invisible beneath the waters. Golden light emanated from Su Yu's feet, causing the surrounding undead with some awareness to retreat. Those without awareness were directly dissolved by the golden light.

...

At the same time.

In the North King's Domain.

At this moment, a grand seal hovered in the sky above the North King's Domain. It was the North King's Seal, emitting a ghostly light that covered most of the North King's Domain. Outside the domain, some strong individuals from the South King's and East King's territories, led by the South King, were advancing layer by layer, compressing the North King's territory!

At this moment, the North King appeared in the sky above his domain, looking into the distance. The South King also turned her gaze in that direction.

There, a faint golden light appeared.

The South King's expression changed slightly. Had the Human Lord of this generation arrived?

In the distance, the North King felt a complex mix of emotions and said in a deep voice, "South King, it should be the Human Lord of the human race! I've said it before, I have only one request: to continue being the North Heavenly King! Go and tell the Human Lord how difficult it is to conquer the North King's Domain! If the living realm continues to interfere in the Death Realm, the entire Death Realm will soon be in turmoil. Even if he sends someone to kill me, it will be difficult to control the Death Realm!"

The separation of life and death was the North King's confidence. No matter how powerful the Human Lord was in the living realm, if that White Dog triggered the Celestial River of Death again, Su Yu would be in big trouble!

The North King continued, "If we continue to fight, and if I die or you fall, it's very likely that several more Heavenly Kings will emerge. At that time, can the Human Lord guarantee that these newly risen Heavenly Kings will listen to him?"

The South King replied coldly, "The human race will not allow you to establish your own kingdom here!"

The North King, somewhat angry, retorted, "Then let the human race conquer the Myriad Realms first! I have already retreated! The human race has declined with each of the nine tides. If I surrender to the human race today, and the living realm is defeated... the Death Realm will be in turmoil again!"

The South King understood his thoughts. The North King didn't want to surrender now. Could the human race win? The chances were slim. The Upper Realm hadn't opened yet. Once it did, the strength of this tide of the human race was far inferior to the Upper Realm. How could they compete?

The South King didn't continue this conversation with him. She turned her gaze to the other side, where the Human Lord should have gone to the East King's territory.

Should she go and see for herself?

Lan Shan Hou held him in high regard, but the South King knew that the new Human Lord wasn't strong. If he were as powerful as the Culture King, he could easily suppress the North Heavenly King. There would be no need for all this.

In the South King's eyes, the Culture King and others were naturally much stronger than Su Yu.

No matter how much Lan Shan Hou praised him, it wouldn't change that.

...

In the East King's Territory.

Inside the grand hall of the royal palace, Su Yu entered. The former East King's Hall was now filled with a deathly aura. It wasn't empty; in fact, it was quite crowded. But all were undead.

The guardians who followed him inside were all shocked.

Nearly a hundred monarchs were present, and before them stood three Necrolords. Including Lan Shan Hou, there were four human Necrolords in total.

At this moment, all the monarchs and Necrolords looked at Su Yu, but none spoke.

Su Yu, without glancing sideways, walked with the stride of a dragon and tiger directly toward the throne at the top of the hall.

Ascending the throne, Su Yu took his seat. Below, Lan Shan Hou and Hetu loudly proclaimed, "Greetings to Our Emperor!"

A group of monarchs knelt in unison, and the human Necrolords hesitated for a moment before following suit. They were unfamiliar with this new Human Lord. However, Lan Shan Hou and Hetu had been continuously conveying the idea that the new Human Lord was formidable!

This made the human Necrolords cautious.

Su Yu also looked at the three human Necrolords. All three were male: Lang Yun Hou, Fan Hai Hou, and Zheng Yang Hou. They were all ancient Necrolords. Two of them, like Lan Shan Hou, were posthumously conferred, while Zheng Yang Hou was conferred during his lifetime and fell in a great battle. However, all three had perished before the fall of the ancient era.

During the period when the Human Emperor disappeared, almost all Necrolords and rulers of laws vanished.

Su Yu observed the three Necrolords, and they, in turn, observed him. This was the first time someone had attempted to subdue the Death Realm. In the previous nine tides, either they lacked the strength or they didn't consider the Death Realm a priority. Regardless, no one had come to subdue it. Even the Hundred Battle King had fought the East King a few times but eventually gave up on fighting here. After all, he was a living being, while Su Yu was half-undead.

Su Yu studied the three for a while before speaking, "The three human Necrolords contributed significantly in the last battle. Hetu, distribute one Necrolord Seal each to the three from the spoils of the last battle."

"By your command!" Hetu responded, and the three Necrolords bowed in gratitude.

Su Yu looked at them again and asked, "Since you have come to the East King's Territory to assist in battle, is there anything you wish to ask or say?"

The three remained silent for a moment before Zheng Yang Hou hesitated and asked, "Human Lord, how many Daofuse experts does the human race have in the living realm?"

"Four."

Only four!

The three frowned slightly. That was very few.

"And the Upper Realm...?"

Su Yu replied calmly, "I don't know. Assume there are none! I'm not too clear on the situation in the Upper Realm."

The three were increasingly frustrated. Could that be true? Lan Shan Hou had said the human race held a significant advantage.

Zheng Yang Hou continued, "Does the Human Lord intend to use the forces of both the living and Death Realms to oppose the experts of the myriad races in the Upper Realm?"

Su Yu smiled, "It's hard to say! We'll see how things unfold! The battlefield is ever-changing; there's no fixed strategy."

"What is the Human Lord's strength?" Zheng Yang Hou asked.

"Daofuse."

Zheng Yang Hou fell silent.

Lang Yun Hou spoke, "Has the Human Lord considered that by now, the Human Lord has been killing myriad race experts on a large scale? Once the Upper Realm opens, there will be no room for negotiation! In previous tides, even when the Human Lords held the advantage, they didn't start with a massacre. That would only lead to a fight to the death..."

"That's why they all lost!" Su Yu said calmly. "They lost miserably! A fight to the death... is a joke. Wasn't it always a fight to the death from the start?"

Lang Yun Hou said in a deep voice, "That's not entirely true. If we act too ruthlessly, the myriad races will do the same, leading to the extinction of the human race..."

"It was always like that from the start!" Su Yu interrupted, "Do you understand what I mean? The human race's survival isn't due to their mercy; it's because the human race's strong left behind contingencies that prevented the extinction of the human race, not because we were merciful, and they followed suit! That's fundamentally wrong; it's a joke!"

"You are all ancient Necrolords, yet you still have such thoughts. It's laughable! This is not the ancient era. We don't need to unite the myriad races. The Human Emperor's pursuit of unification and integration of the myriad races failed!"

"And we are not pursuing that. We are pursuing the extinction of the myriad races. There will be no more chaos from the myriad races!"

Su Yu said coldly, "You can question my strength, you can question the final outcome, but the overall framework will not change because of your doubts! Whether it's the living realm or the Death Realm, it will only follow my vision. That's my only requirement. You can curse or be unwilling, but I won't listen!"

Su Yu continued coldly, "Don't talk to me about the previous nine tides. They were failures! If I fail, and there are still eleven tides, you can talk to the next Human Lord. This generation's Human Lord, Su Yu, won't listen to you. He acts alone, leading to the human race's defeat!"

The three human Necrolords were left with no choice.

Fine, there's no point in saying more.

This one wouldn't listen to any of it, nor did he care about comparisons. In his eyes, the previous nine tides and even the ancient era were failures.

Zhengyang Marquis quickly shifted the topic, asking, "If the Upper Realm opens and the Human Race is defeated, what should we do?"

Su Yu frowned, "If we're defeated, we're defeated. Do you think we can match them now? Ask the Hundred Battle King why he buried over a hundred Daofuse cultivators!"

"......"

The group was left awkward by his words.

Su Yu continued, "Don't ask me what happens if we're defeated! It's meaningless. Without me, we'd be annihilated now. Talking about the future is for the victors! If we can't match the Upper Realm, it's not my fault. You can blame the Hundred Battle King, but don't come to me saying it's my fault if the Human Race is wiped out. That's not my responsibility!"

The three Human Race marquises could only laugh dryly, unable to argue.

This new Human Lord was indeed domineering.

Even questioning was not allowed!

It wasn't even questioning, just a bit of concern. But thinking about it, if we're defeated, we're defeated. It's not something we can help; it's a result of the last tide.

Su Yu quickly added, "All this talk about the future is pointless! You're asking the wrong questions! Well, you're old and haven't been to the Death Realm in a long time, so you don't understand these things! What you should be asking now is how to deal with the North King! After dealing with the North King, how do we break out of the Death Realm? The Upper Realm is not something to consider now!"

"......"

Zhengyang Marquis obediently asked, "Then, Human Lord... have you thought of a way to deal with the North King?"

"No."

"......"

Speechless!

The necromancer marquises looked at Lanshan Marquis, finding this person difficult to deal with.

Lanshan Marquis had no choice but to step forward, "Your Majesty, it's difficult for living beings to act now, but those guardians petrified by King Gong can act. However... they don't seem to have Daofuse power."

Su Yu nodded, "So my idea is to first capture the idle necromancer lords. Not all lords in the East King Domain and West King Domain will be obedient! And the Celestial River of Death too! Open the Luminous Domain Mansion, let the guardians kill, and there should be some rewards... Finally, kill necromancer marquises to advance to Daofuse..."

Lanshan Marquis asked solemnly, "But what if it draws out powerful beings from the Celestial River of Death..."

"If it comes to that, I'll arrange for top experts from the living realm to come over!"

Su Yu said calmly, "If it really comes to that, we'll break the pot and let it shatter! Sooner or later, they'll come out. If they oppose me, then let them all come out. I'm not afraid of making a big scene! Right now, I just want to control the changes to a minimum, not that we can't deal with the North King!"

Lanshan Marquis nodded, dropping the subject, and asked, "Then, Your Majesty, do you want to summon the South King?"

Su Yu shook his head, "I'll go see her myself. Lanshan, come with me. The others, Hetu, you and Shan Qi, along with Zhengyang Marquis and the others, protect the path and capture some lord-level necromancers from the Celestial River of Death! When I return, I'll teleport everyone into the Luminous Domain Mansion. Capture as many as you can!"

"Understood!"

Hetu accepted the order. Su Yu added, "Hetu, if you want to unseal yourself, you can. It's a good chance to strengthen yourself, but the hope of resurrection will decrease."

Hetu hesitated.

Unseal?

Resurrection...

Of course, he wanted to resurrect. No matter how good being a necromancer was, it wasn't as good as being alive.

But, was there really hope?

Watching others grow stronger step by step while he remained at the seventh stage, Hetu had been considering this recently. Because of his weak strength, the necromancer marquises didn't give him much face.

Hetu thought for a moment and said, "I am willing to unseal! I am already close to Daofuse power. Over the years, many memories have resurfaced. After unsealing, I should have combat power close to Daofuse!"

"Have you thought it through?"

Su Yu looked at him, "You have the best chance of resurrection! When you died, General Hongmeng had you consume the Fruit of Life and Death, transforming your body directly into a necromancer to enter the Death Realm!"

Hetu frowned, then quickly said, "I am willing to unseal! If Your Majesty has the power to resurrect necromancers, then resurrecting a seventh stage or a Daofuse is just a matter of time! If Your Majesty can resurrect an Eternal after reaching Daofuse, then at worst, I'll wait until Your Majesty becomes the master of laws, and naturally, there will be a chance!"

Su Yu laughed, "You have an open mind! Master of laws... well, let's see if we can live until then."

As he spoke, a pen appeared in his hand, and with a stroke, he pointed it at Hetu.

The necromancer marquises were all shocked!

The Culture King's Pen!

Lanshan Marquis's eyes lit up. Su Yu had truly inherited the Culture King's path.

As for Hetu, he felt a blur before his eyes. In the next moment, a restrictive force within him was broken by the pen.

Boom!

A powerful aura of death erupted instantly. Hetu hadn't been idle over the years, and his strength in life wasn't weak. Once unsealed, he exploded instantly!

In the blink of an eye, his aura reached the eighth stage, and soon, the ninth stage!

After reaching the ninth stage, a necromancer path appeared above his head. Su Yu could see with the naked eye that Hetu's small path was circling a great path, climbing rapidly, but unfortunately, the resistance grew stronger!

Gradually, Hetu felt powerless.

Su Yu could vaguely see a huge wave blocking Hetu's small path.

This was the barrier to Daofuse!

Hetu still couldn't step into Daofuse, but he was close. At this moment, Hetu was somewhat disappointed.

Even after unsealing, he couldn't step into Daofuse in one go.

If he had been Daofuse in life, he could have retained Daofuse combat power after resurrection.

Su Yu watched for a while, then nodded, "Not bad. With some luck, you might soon step into Daofuse!"

With that, Su Yu smiled, "Shan Qi, you stay here and capture some lords. I'm going to meet the South King. If all goes well, we might soon launch a war against the North King!"

"Understood!"

Shan Qi and the others accepted the order.

In the grand hall, many necromancer lords recognized these guardians. Some necromancer lords felt strange. They used to be enemies, but now they were on the same side.

The world is unpredictable; indeed, there are no eternal enemies.

...

Su Yu only stayed briefly at the East King's Palace. Soon, he flew towards the border of the North King's Palace with Lanshan Marquis.

The South King was there.

There was still danger, but Old Turtle's words reassured Su Yu a bit. Since the South King was a little fan of the Culture King, the likelihood of betrayal was low.

...

In the North King's Palace area.

Both the South King and the North King saw the golden light.

The North King's eyes flickered, looking at the distant South King, and transmitted his voice, "He comes alone, only bringing Lanshan Marquis. If we deal with him, the Death Realm will be ours to command..."

Su Yu didn't bring that dog or the old turtle. The North King thought Su Yu was too bold!

Not just the North King, even Lanshan Marquis, who accompanied Su Yu, transmitted her voice, "Your Majesty, are we really going just like this? It's too dangerous! This is the North King's territory, and the South King... her situation is uncertain... even if it's certain, Your Majesty... could you... not be so... so..."

She was too embarrassed to say that Su Yu was too blunt.

Earlier, the three Human Race marquises were left speechless by him.

Of course, it was fine before. Even if the three marquises were dissatisfied, with Lanshan Marquis and so many guardians around, it wasn't a big problem.

But now, Su Yu couldn't do that!

If he offended the South King here, Su Yu might face two Heavenly Kings and dozens of necromancer marquises.

Su Yu smiled, transmitting his voice, "Don't worry!"

Not reassured!

Lanshan Marquis was very helpless. How could she be reassured!

Not at all!

Since she met this Human Lord, he had always been domineering and never compromised or spoke softly.

Could anyone be reassured?

And the South King was a dominant figure. Lanshan Marquis was really worried that the meeting would turn unpleasant.

...

Soon, Su Yu arrived at the location.

From a distance, he saw the powerful figure. Under Lanshan Marquis's worried gaze, Su Yu smiled from afar, "Senior South King, this junior Su Yu, disciple of the Culture King, greets Master!"

"......"

Stunned.

Lanshan Marquis was dumbfounded.

Ahead, the South King was taken aback, her eyes flickering. At this moment, the South King was also dumbfounded.

She had been hesitating about whether to greet Su Yu.

What to say when they met?

If she didn't acknowledge him, what should she do?

But she didn't expect, didn't anticipate, such a sudden statement—Master?

The South King's mind was muddled!

Master?

Disciple of the Culture King?

She was completely confused. How should I respond?

What should I do?

Should I acknowledge it?

This is so difficult!

Disciple of the Culture King, she was still in a daze when Su Yu suddenly took out a pen, quickly writing something in the void. In the blink of an eye, it formed a golden book. Su Yu took out the Human Lord Seal and stamped it, sending the golden book flying towards the South King.

But the South King wasn't paying attention to that. She was staring at the pen, lost in confusion.

The Culture King's Pen!

He... can use the Culture King's Pen!

The South King stared blankly at Su Yu. The golden book had already landed in her hands. Su Yu smiled, "Senior, Master? This is the seal I wrote. The ancient times have disappeared. I will add the Human Race's fortune to you, conferring you as the South Heavenly King!"

The South King was still bewildered. In her confusion, she accepted the golden book and, after a while, bowed slightly, "Thank... thank you!"

She was a bit muddled. Should I thank him?

I am already the South King!

Does accepting this have any use?

Maybe it does!

Whether it does or not, it was written with the Culture King's Pen, so I'll keep it.

...

Lanshan Marquis's jaw almost dropped.

After a while, two words appeared in her mind: Holy crap!

Is this even possible?

Is this even possible!

Is it over just like that?

Did he just subdue the South King like that?

Don't joke!

The South King... really accepted Su Yu's golden book. This... this wasn't what I expected!

Oh my god!

Lanshan Marquis's mindset was collapsing. This wasn't the Culture King, not at all. She no longer thought this generation's Human Lord was like the Culture King. This Human Lord was just a tough nut!

Her mindset was collapsing!

Lanshan Marquis was as dumbfounded as the South King, not knowing what she was thinking.
