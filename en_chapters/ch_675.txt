Chapter 675: Subduing the South Heavenly King is Too Easy (Please Subscribe)

Accompanying Old Turtle on a trip through the River of Time didn't consume much of Su Yu's energy.

He hadn't really been able to give Old Turtle any pointers, nor would he tell Old Turtle to change his dao. Old Turtle knew where his own problems lay, so he had a way forward. As long as it wasn't too conflicting, enjoying a single dao was still more comfortable than forging a new one.

The lazy turtle most likely wouldn't forge his own dao!

…

After arranging the new Garrison Masters, Su Yu left both the Book Spirit and the Tea Plant in Grand Dream City.

By then, Grand Dream City had gathered a large number of Daofuse combatants.

Great Xia King, Great Qin King, Heavendoom—the three of them—Tian Yue, and Old Turtle, as well as Great Ming King who was still researching the grand formation outside. Once Great Ming King also successfully achieved Daofuse, the number of Daofuse experts here would reach double digits.

Anyone who dared to raid Grand Dream City at this time... Su Yu would have to pray for them. It would be best if they were Ruler of Laws, otherwise, even if the Four Heavenly Kings came, they would have to kneel.

As for Su Yu, he entered the Death Realm with the 27 Garrison Masters whose petrification had not yet been lifted.

These 27 Garrison Masters were all powerful, and they had all retrieved their weapons.

Among them, six were at the ninth-stage Eternal, fourteen at the eighth-stage, and the remaining seven were at the seventh-stage.

With such strength, they could even fight against four or five Daofuse experts.

Four or five Daofuse experts could, in theory, fight a Heavenly King. According to the equation, they should be able to fight a Heavenly King... but unfortunately, this equation didn't hold true. These Eternal experts, when facing a Heavenly King, would most likely be slapped to death one by one, quickly wiped out!

…

Death Realm.

Su Yu entered the Death Realm once more, the sky as dim as ever.

There were very few death spirits in the passage beneath the ancient city now. Even if there were, most were newly born, washed down by the great waves from the Celestial River of Death, wandering about.

They were all very weak; there weren't even many Sunmoon Realm experts among them.

Of course, the entire Spirit Suppressing Domain still had an invincible Monarch, the passage near Grandstar City.

There, as always, a fortress stood.

The other invincible Monarchs guarding the passages below had all been taken away, except for Xing Yue. She was unwilling to leave, and no one went to find her. Hetu and the others didn't bother with Xing Yue.

They all knew that Xing Yue was Su Yu's converted Monarch.

Xing Yue's strength wasn't actually strong enough now. Su Yu often borrowed death qi from various cities, but the death qi channel between them was still not cut off. Su Yu could actually cut it off.

However, Su Yu didn't do so; he still wanted to try resurrection.

He had previously comprehended the 'life' character, but now the power of the character had been extracted, mainly the pen dao power. Su Yu might not be able to resurrect people, after all, Culture King had failed.

He would look at the situation later; for now, he would put it aside.

Xing Yue didn't want to go to the East King's Residence, and Su Yu didn't say anything. Su Yu arranged for Zhou Potian to guard Grandstar City. The Zhou family members still had brains, and Su Yu didn't say much, just to avoid conflict with Xing Yue.

“Your Majesty!”

Soon after Su Yu arrived, a powerful expert quickly rushed over from afar. It was Marquis Lanshan.

Su Yu was a little surprised and looked at Marquis Lanshan. “Why are you here?”

“I was just about to come here to see the Spirit Suppressing General!”

Marquis Lanshan glanced at the Garrison Masters behind Su Yu, some of whom she recognized, and nodded slightly. She quickly said, “Your Majesty, the Celestial River of Death has been slightly turbulent recently. In the past, it would take a long time for a Monarch to revive. Recently, in the East King's Domain alone, more than ten Death Monarchs have revived!”

“Are there any Death Marquis?”

Su Yu asked.

Marquis Lanshan quickly replied, “None have been found yet, but there should be! However, Death Marquis are different from Death Monarchs. When a Death Monarch revives, they only retain at most ten percent of their memories and need to slowly recover, appearing somewhat dull! But when a Death Marquis revives, they will recover at least fifty percent of their memories, making them far more intelligent than Death Monarchs.”

“When Death Monarchs revive, instinct drives them out of the Celestial River of Death, while Death Marquis might remain dormant in the river!”

Su Yu nodded. He had a vague feeling last time that a Death Marquis had revived but hadn't emerged.

Sure enough, these guys were quite intelligent.

As for the Monarch-level ones, they were still idiots even after reviving. For example, Xia Chen, who had struggled for a long time to recover some memories. If he hadn't devoured the Culture King's Token, it might have taken many more years to recover his memories.

Speaking of which, Xia Chen should have left with Liu Hong.

That grandson Liu Hong really had some ability. Su Yu didn't know how he managed to trick Xia Chen into leaving. Even Hetu didn't know the situation; Xia Chen just disappeared with Liu Hong.

“Then you're looking for Grand Dream…”

“I wanted to ask him if he would accompany me on a trip to the Celestial River of Death to assess the situation, to prevent any turmoil!”

Marquis Lanshan said in a deep voice, “Death Marquis are fine, but I'm afraid some ancient existences will revive! What if, just as we conquer the Death Realm, a top-tier Heavenly King-level expert emerges? With two Heavenly Kings dead, the Death Realm might produce more Heavenly Kings!”

With two Heavenly King-level experts dead, a portion of the Great Dao was freed up, which was enough to support the emergence of a new Heavenly King, or even two, especially since many Death Marquis had also died.

Recently, Marquis Lanshan felt her strength increasing quite rapidly.

Because the Great Dao had been freed up!

One radish, one pit. Su Yu's actions several times had also caused turmoil in the Death Great Dao, clearing out many individuals and killing many Death Marquis. With good luck, three more Death Heavenly Kings could emerge.

Su Yu nodded slightly.

It was possible.

But even with this possibility, he couldn't say he wouldn't fight. The newly emerged Death Marquis, or even Heavenly Kings, might be humans, right?

Even if not, it wouldn't be worse than it was now.

“Let's go, let's check out the East King's Domain first!”

Su Yu smiled. “There's nothing we can do about this. The Celestial River of Death has existed for too long. Who knows how many powerful experts and prodigies are buried within! You should cultivate more recently. In the last battle, you devoured so many death spirit marks. Advance to Heavenly King soon.”

Marquis Lanshan looked embarrassed. She had eaten them, but her strength didn't increase as quickly as she had imagined.

Merging with the Great Dao, even the Death Great Dao, still required talent and comprehension.

It wasn't just about devouring wildly!

Unfortunately, she belonged to the group whose talent wasn't top-tier. Warriors... all had this problem. It was the Culture Sages who had a deeper understanding of the Great Dao.

Marquis Lanshan was a fierce general in ancient times, not a strategist.

Seeing her remain silent, Su Yu felt helpless.

He understood!

Compared to Marquis Lanshan advancing to Heavenly King, perhaps Hetu had a better chance. Su Yu was thinking about whether to let Old Turtle lift Hetu's seal. Old Turtle hoped for Hetu's resurrection.

But Su Yu felt that if Hetu didn't revive, he might already be a Death Marquis now.

This guy was quite clever.

If Hetu was a Death Marquis and then devoured a large number of treasures, he might truly advance to Heavenly King.

How long would they have to wait for resurrection?

By the time the war ended, Hetu might not have revived and would still be a seventh-stage Eternal death spirit.

As Su Yu was thinking, Old Turtle's sigh suddenly reached his ears. “Emperor Yu, if Hetu has his own ideas, Emperor Yu can unseal him. I want him to revive... but... I actually know, it's like the moon in the water. In the past, Culture King wanted to revive people and failed, let alone me.”

Su Yu had to admit, Old Turtle was quite formidable. Did he sense Su Yu's thoughts?

Forget it, he would ask Hetu himself.

The stronger one was, the harder it was to revive; that was inevitable!

“Resurrection... South Heavenly King…”

Did South Heavenly King know that Culture King came here to revive people?

Then did South Heavenly King know how to revive?

“Hetu was already close to the Daofuse Realm when he was alive. Once unsealed, he might quickly step into Daofuse. If he gains some benefits during the period of killing North Heavenly King, he might not become a Heavenly King, but he could become a top-tier Daofuse combatant…”

Su Yu, with these thoughts, quickly said, “Let's go, to the East King's Residence!”

“Understood!”

Everyone responded, and Marquis Lanshan quickly followed, a little excited. She hurriedly said, “Your Majesty, the East King's Domain is currently stable. I have already arranged for people to take over the West King's Domain! It's just that east and west are far apart, and communication is inconvenient unless we open up the South King's Domain or North King's Domain…”

“What did South Heavenly King say?”

Su Yu asked. Marquis Lanshan immediately replied, “South Heavenly King didn't say anything, just... she probably wants to meet Your Majesty before making a decision.”

Speaking of this, Marquis Lanshan sent a voice transmission, “South Heavenly King does favor the human race, but South Heavenly King is arrogant. If Your Majesty cannot subdue her, then South Heavenly King will only be an ally, not a subordinate of the human race!”

Su Yu nodded slightly.

He understood.

South Heavenly King helped the human race, but only the human race, not the Human Lord!

Simply put, 'I'll help you out of respect for Culture King, but if you Human Lord are useless and incompetent, then I'll only offer some assistance and won't truly risk my life for you.

'I won't listen to your commands.

'I'll act according to my own ideas to help the human race.'

Su Yu smiled, not really bothered. That was fine.

Otherwise, if every Human Lord was helped, wouldn't helping Hundred Battle King in the last tide have led to disaster?

Wouldn't even the last bit of foundation be gone?

Those who didn't help Hundred Battle King in the last tide now had a chance to help Su Yu, like Old Turtle and the others. If they had all helped Hundred Battle King in the last tide... they would all be doomed!

He once again insulted Hundred Battle King in his mind, still full of resentment.

A monarch who lost a great empire!

Marquis Lanshan, unaware of the drama unfolding in Su Yu's mind, quickly reported, “Your Majesty, also, North Heavenly King previously sent an envoy. North Heavenly King's intention is that he only wishes to divide the North King's Domain as his own fief. He has no intention of being an enemy of the human race; otherwise, he would have allied with others to deal with the human race long ago! Now, with two Heavenly Kings fallen, North Heavenly King's strength is actually three parts stronger than before. His intention is to negotiate peace!”

“Negotiate peace?”

Su Yu laughed. “How can I allow others to snore beside my bed! Is North Heavenly King an idiot? Or does he think I'm an idiot? Would I leave a disobedient Heavenly King expert at my doorstep?”

“Ignore him!”

Su Yu said, then added, “Send another envoy, and directly execute him. Tell North Heavenly King that there is no room for compromise! Either surrender directly, and after surrendering, voluntarily disperse part of his Great Dao comprehension, degrading himself to the level of a Death Marquis!”

Marquis Lanshan's expression changed slightly.

This was almost impossible!

That could only mean war!

Surrender, and Su Yu even demanded North Heavenly King to disperse his Great Dao power. This... Marquis Lanshan felt it was a bit too idealistic.

“Your Majesty, North Heavenly King will not surrender.”

Su Yu nodded. “I know! But if he maintains his top-tier Heavenly King combat strength, I would need a top-tier Heavenly King to constantly watch him, which would be even more dangerous than now. If he were considered one of us, and we relaxed our guard, and he pulled a trick... that would be real trouble. It's better to directly declare our enmity!”

Marquis Lanshan thought for a moment and nodded slightly. That was true.

The group quickly moved forward, and Su Yu's body exuded a faint glow, not of vitality, but of some power of laws.

Su Yu was dispelling some weak power of laws here, allowing the Human Lord's Seal's power of fortune to cover some areas.

This way, when human or Su Yu's side's experts entered the Death Realm to fight in the future, it would be easier than it was now.

“Your Majesty is getting stronger and stronger!”

Marquis Lanshan sighed with emotion. He seemed much more powerful than before, and more and more like Culture King... No, he seemed a little different again!

Marquis Lanshan thought to herself, a very complex feeling.

The previous Su Yu was actually very similar to Culture King. Now, he was even more similar, yet upon closer inspection, he was different again. His temperament seemed to have diverged from Culture King's.

He had a bit more domineering presence than Culture King, and a bit less gentleness.

Su Yu didn't pay attention to these things. Soon, he saw the Celestial River of Death. The Celestial River of Death stretched across the heavens and earth, encircling all directions. The entire Death Realm was formed into a closed loop by this Celestial River.

But it wasn't just that. The Celestial River of Death didn't simply make the Death Realm into a 'hui' (回) shape. Su Yu looked up at the sky. The Celestial River of Death was more like a tent!

The four sides below were the Celestial River that everyone saw. What wasn't seen actually covered the entire realm!

Connecting all directions!

“A tent... no, more like a bowl, a large bowl placed upright!”

Not inverted, but with the rim of the bowl spreading out in all directions, covering the entire Death Realm, and incidentally guiding the deceased experts.

The more Su Yu looked, the more astonished he became.

Now, he had many insights.

The creator of this Celestial River of Death, who should also be the creator of the Death Great Dao, truly wanted to create a realm. Could such a powerful expert die?

Who could kill him?

The master of the human race's physical body dao, upon meeting this person, would most likely also be killed.

With such thoughts, Su Yu soon stepped onto the Celestial River of Death.

In the river, countless corpses floated, and many more were submerged, completely unseen.

Su Yu's feet glowed with golden light, and the death spirits around, those with some consciousness, retreated one after another.

Those without consciousness were directly dissolved by the golden light.

…

At the same time.

North King's Domain.

At this moment, above the North King's Domain, a large seal floated. It was North Heavenly King's Seal. The large seal emitted a faint light, covering more than half of the North King's Domain. Outside the domain, some experts from the South King's Residence and East King's Residence, led by South Heavenly King, were advancing layer by layer!

Compressing North Heavenly King's territory!

And at this moment, above the North King's Residence, North Heavenly King appeared, looking into the distance. South Heavenly King also instantly looked in that direction.

There, a faint golden light appeared.

South Heavenly King's expression changed slightly. This generation's Human Lord had entered?

And in the distance, North Heavenly King's mood was even more complex. He said in a deep voice, “South Heavenly King, it should be the Human Lord who has arrived! I said, I only have one request: to continue being my North Heavenly King! You go tell the Human Lord how difficult it is to conquer the North King's Domain! If the Living Realm interferes with the Death Realm again, the entire Death Realm will soon be in turmoil. Even if he sends people to kill me, he will find it difficult to control the Death Realm!”

The separation of life and death was North Heavenly King's confidence. No matter how powerful the Human Lord was in the Living Realm, the White Dog had activated the Celestial River of Death last time. If it happened again, Su Yu would be in great trouble!

North Heavenly King added, “If we continue to fight, and I die, or you fall, several more Heavenly Kings might be born
