Chapter 810: The Scheming Su Yu

On this day, Su Yu unsealed the Martial Emperor, the Undead Emperor, and the Divine Empress. In a single day, three new rulers of laws emerged!

On this day, Su Yu righteously pressured Hundred Battle King, forcing him to agree to suppress the Control King’s lineage. Of course, Hundred Battle King might not be willing to comply.

...

Death Realm.

Su Yu had returned.

Tongtian and a few others followed him. Lantian noticed Su Yu's cold demeanor, devoid of any joy, and couldn't help but ask, "Your Majesty, are you worried that Hundred Battle King will break his promise?"

Su Yu replied solemnly, "No! It's not that I'm worried he'll break his promise; it's that... he never intended to keep it!"

Su Yu pondered deeply, "What exactly is Hundred Battle King planning?"

From Hundred Battle King's hesitation, his reluctance, and his final smiles, Su Yu sensed that Hundred Battle King... might never keep his promise. He was forced by Su Yu to agree to suppress the Sin Clan, but he was unwilling at heart.

A forced melon is never sweet!

Su Yu furrowed his brows, "Even if he respects the Human Ancestor, I can't understand why he insists on bringing the Human Ancestor back first! Unless... there's a crucial factor, like the return of the Human Emperor being detrimental to him! Or perhaps, the Human Emperor and the Human Ancestor have a deep-seated grudge?"

If that's the case, it would explain a lot.

The Human Emperor and the Human Ancestor have a deep enmity! But how could there be such a grudge between someone from the early ancient times and someone from the late ancient times?

Or perhaps, the Human Ancestor and the Human Emperor have different stances, different camps?

That's also possible!

Judging by Hundred Battle King's attitude, he never intended to assist the Human Emperor, which is suspicious.

Hundred Battle King must know something.

Or perhaps, Hundred Battle King simply doesn't want more ancestors above him; he wants to be king himself?

Is that possible?

It's possible!

Su Yu contemplated silently, while Lantian, slightly frowning, said, "If he doesn't keep his promise, at least half of his followers might leave him! Your Majesty, these people are all humans! Even if they were deserters six thousand years ago... being deserters doesn't mean they don't care about the faith in the human race!"

Most races have a sense of kinship.

Even the Divine Empress, who isn't weak, still cares about her race.

The Human Emperor and others, fighting on the front lines, gave up their paths for the sake of their race.

Being strong doesn't mean they don't care about their race.

It's innate!

It's also a belief!

Those deserters from six thousand years ago, some of them were passive, forced into battle, forced to die, forced to flee.

There are certainly those without humanity!

But if all of them lacked humanity, how could they cultivate to Daofuse, Heavenly King, or Heavenly Sovereign... Lantian doesn't believe it.

Some of the ancient marquises might still be disciples or loyal subordinates of ancient human kings.

In such a situation, if Hundred Battle King doesn't keep his promise, will they continue to follow him?

Wouldn't that be cutting themselves off from the human race?

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Some might flee, but... does Hundred Battle King care?"

Lantian was slightly taken aback.

"Your Majesty means?"

"Does he really care about these people?"

Su Yu furrowed his brows, "Hundred Battle King... Great Zhou King said he was sentimental and righteous, but now it seems, it's somewhat insincere!"

What does that mean?

Lantian was puzzled because, so far, Hundred Battle King seemed to treat his subordinates well. Even when some disagreed with him, Hundred Battle King never seemed to get angry.

Seeing Lantian's confusion, Su Yu explained, "Not to mention other things, my first impression of Hundred Battle King is... even if he's not a brute, he's a hero! Domineering, self-centered, you kill one of mine, I kill your entire family... However, today I severely injured the Ancient Giant King with one punch, and that's his father-in-law!"

Su Yu said coldly, "If I had a father-in-law who was severely injured by someone, even if I couldn't fight back, I wouldn't let it go easily! I'm a ruler, you hurt my father-in-law, that's a mortal enemy!"

Lantian nodded slightly, and Tongtian Marquis curiously asked, "Your Majesty wants to find a father-in-law?"

"..."

Damn you!

Su Yu cursed inwardly. I'm discussing serious matters, and you suddenly interrupt with nonsense?

Fat Ball, hearing this, also curiously asked, "Su Yu, who do you want as your father-in-law?"

Fat Ball always called Su Yu by his name or "new Human Lord." Su Yu didn't mind this, as the dog only recognized its master and little master. If Su Yu hadn't asked for their help, Fat Ball probably wouldn't have bothered to come out.

The topic had veered off!

Su Yu was helpless!

I'm talking about serious matters!

He forcibly steered the conversation back, "If Hundred Battle King were truly sentimental and righteous, he wouldn't let it go. He seems to have the demeanor of a hero, but in reality, it's all nonsense! Fat Ball's strike made Long Eyebrow lose face, Long Eyebrow is his subordinate Heavenly Sovereign, also his mouthpiece! Yet, Hundred Battle King allowed Long Eyebrow to be beaten. I wanted to test him, and he wanted to see the strength of my subordinates!"

"But Hundred Battle King doesn't want to fall out with me now, not even hoping to fall out with me. Otherwise, when he captured Tongtian, he shouldn't have let him go so easily! Instead, he should have retaliated!"

"Fat Ball hitting Long Eyebrow's face is like hitting Hundred Battle King's face. Normally, as a ruler, how could Hundred Battle King be so weak? Hundred Battle King should have taught Tongtian a lesson, making him lose face!"

Lantian raised an eyebrow slightly, "Your Majesty means, Hundred Battle King is too soft, so soft that it's suspicious! As a strong figure like Hundred Battle King, being humiliated by Your Majesty, he should retaliate, yet he didn't. Excessive softness instead indicates a bigger plot?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu nodded, that's exactly the point.

Today's Hundred Battle King, seemingly soft, seemingly at a disadvantage, seemingly humble and courteous, in reality, this personality suits strategists, suits people like Great Zhou King, suits people like Changqing.

But it absolutely doesn't suit a ruler like Hundred Battle King!

If Hundred Battle King were such a person, he couldn't have become the revered ruler of the Ninth Tide!

If he had always been like this, the Ninth Tide wouldn't have been won over by him!

So, this time Hundred Battle King appeared, and in these six thousand years, there must have been a significant change, a big plot, all to avoid too much conflict with Su Yu.

"Hundred Battle King... has changed!"

Su Yu didn't know Hundred Battle King from six thousand years ago, but he knew Hundred Battle King had changed.

Not the same as before!

Now, even his subordinates are somewhat opposed to him. Previously, Marquis Zhennan, who was willing to sacrifice himself for Hundred Battle King, even revealed everything about Hundred Battle King to Su Yu.

And Marquis Zhennan, at the moment of departure, had a desolate back, still willing to fight for Hundred Battle King... but with a somewhat saddened attitude, it's very complicated.

If Hundred Battle King were truly incompetent, Marquis Zhennan would have left long ago, but he didn't.

What does that represent?

It represents that Marquis Zhennan actually hopes Hundred Battle King can change, can return to his former self, hopes Hundred Battle King can turn the tide, not letting his following be in vain.

The deeper the love, the deeper the hate!

Marquis Zhennan, from the bottom of his heart, actually admires Hundred Battle King, but because of a series of actions by Hundred Battle King, he was saddened, which led to the previous scene.

All of this, Su Yu analyzed and judged.

Thus, Su Yu concluded that the current Hundred Battle King is different from before!

Completely different!

A Hundred Battle King who allows his subordinates to be humiliated cannot be recognized by so many strong individuals, even willing to give up ancient marquis positions in the Human Emperor's court for him!

It's impossible for fifty or more people!

Moreover, some even made way for him, it can be said that the elders of the previous tide were almost all willing to die for him.

"Hundred Battle King is suspicious!"

Su Yu shook his head, too suspicious!

This made him uneasy!

At this time, Lantian also took it seriously, nodding, "According to Your Majesty's words, it is indeed suspicious! From a hero to a smiling tiger... Hundred Battle King must have undergone some major change!"

He analyzed for a moment, then thought and said, "Your Majesty, could it be related to the Giant Race, related to Zhou Ji?"

"What do you mean?" Su Yu became interested and smiled, "Tell me."

Lantian analyzed, "Hundred Battle King's change, I think it might not be now, but six thousand years ago, before the final battle! Or, after the birth of Zhou Ji with the Giant Race! Think about it, if Hundred Battle King was like this from the beginning, no one would have followed him! Those old antiques are very wary of the Human Lord, plus the Torchbearer lineage is controlled by an old schemer like Great Zhou King, yet they fell into the trap, the Torchbearer lineage almost came out in full force... Could Great Zhou King really not control it?"

Lantian laughed, "So I suspect, maybe the appearance of Bingku and others was a gamble by Great Zhou King, he thought Hundred Battle King could win, could achieve his dreams and goals, so he fully supported Hundred Battle King!"

"Great Zhou King's vision is very sharp, I must admit!"

"But he, yet, invested heavily in Hundred Battle King, which means, at that time, Great Zhou King thought Hundred Battle King was fine! Until the end, Great Zhou King might have discovered something wrong, withdrew, saved himself, but had to give up the Torchbearer lineage!"

Lantian chuckled, "To make Great Zhou King misjudge and suffer a loss, I think, Hundred Battle King might have suddenly changed his attitude during that period, which led to the defeat! I think asking Great Zhou King might reveal the truth!"

Su Yu pondered, then asked, "Why did you think of Zhou Ji?"

Lantian smiled, "Hundred Battle King grew up under everyone's watchful eyes, the only thing that deviated might be the marriage with the Giant Race, giving birth to Zhou Ji! As for the matter of Yue Luo, I suspect, Great Zhou King might have known about it!"

"And after that, Hundred Battle King might have claimed to be of the Human Ancestor's bloodline, before that, he might not have considered these, Your Majesty, what do you think?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, it made sense!

It made a lot of sense!

I have to say, Lantian's analysis might have really hit the key points.

Hundred Battle King's change might really be related to Zhou Ji.

Su Yu quickly said, "It's good to have a sense, the specifics, maybe only Hundred Battle King knows! But Zhou Ji, the Giant Race, the Human Ancestor, the Gate of Hell... all these existences might have a connection, a line exists... I haven't figured it out yet!"

Su Yu wasn't a god, there were too few clues now, even brainstorming was difficult.

As the clues accumulated, he would eventually be able to analyze the situation in detail.

Just then, Su Yu's eyes flickered, and in the next moment, a figure appeared before them. In the darkness, the figure's eyes shone brightly, distinctly different from those of a typical undead, yet it was indeed an undead!

The Undead Emperor!

He had broken free!

The Undead Emperor did not approach them, avoiding any potential conflict. At this moment, his true form was revealed. At his level, he was not much different from a living person. His appearance was slightly sallow but no longer charred black. Apart from the dense death aura, he resembled a half-undead rather than a complete one. He was thin and carried an air of elegance. In life, he might have been a scholar.

"Chen greets Emperor Su!"

Su Yu was surprised, "You're... already declaring yourself a subject? Aren't you going to set any conditions?"

"......"

Awkward!

The previously elegant Undead Emperor felt a bit embarrassed, his composure broken by Su Yu's words. It was easy to misunderstand. He cleared his throat, "I... my original name is Chen! As in 'starry sky' Chen!"

Su Yu was taken aback and nodded, "It seems you people like single-character names."

The Undead Emperor had to explain, "Not exactly... it's just that during our era, there was no need for overly complex names. For example, the Human Ancestor was named Zhou! The Master of the Undead was named..."

Just as he was about to continue, he suddenly laughed at himself, "This place is not suitable for mentioning his name!"

This was the Death Realm, and it was not appropriate to mention it. Ordinary people might say it unconsciously, and nobody would care. But he knew of that existence, a top-tier one, and mentioning it might trigger the Celestial River of Death's response.

Su Yu, however, was intrigued, "Interesting, so you're from the late Opening Heaven period, the early ancient times, right?"

"Yes."

The Undead Emperor nodded slightly, "This time, breaking the seal, I must thank Emperor Su for your assistance!"

"It was incidental, and besides, I promised you before!"

Su Yu smiled, "You could be considered one of the first undead in the Death Realm, right?"

"Yes."

The Undead Emperor nodded slightly, "In fact, when the Master of the Undead opened the heavens, I even observed it..."

He laughed at himself, "As a result, I became one of the first undead! But it's fine. Without the Master of the Undead, perhaps I wouldn't have had a second life! Before me, those who fell truly perished. At least I lived countless more years."

He didn't harbor any particular love or hatred for the Master of the Undead. The opportunity to become undead was a blessing, though they had worked for the Master of the Undead for countless years, which could be considered repayment. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Su Yu, however, became interested, "You mean you observed him opening the heavens?"

"Yes."

The Undead Emperor continued, "Of course, it was from a distance, not up close. The event was quite grand! During that time, many could sense it, but some of us were bolder and got a bit closer. The Master of the Undead was quite magnanimous and did not drive us away, so we were able to observe from afar!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling, "Those who open the heavens might not mind being observed! Everyone's path is different. You can watch, but you may not be able to emulate it. Even if you do, it wouldn't be your own path of opening the heavens, just a reference!"

At this point, Su Yu eagerly asked, "Was there anything unusual about his opening of the heavens?"

"Unusual?"

The Undead Emperor wasn't sure what Su Yu meant by unusual. After thinking for a moment, he said, "Not really unusual. When he opened the heavens, he attracted some Chaos Ancient Beasts that tried to stop him... Oh, he extracted a large amount of death aura from the River of Time, causing some disturbances during the opening, creating some trouble!"

"But before he opened the heavens, he was already incredibly powerful, so it didn't cause much damage."

At this point, the Undead Emperor thought for a moment and added, "After opening the heavens, the Master of the Undead suddenly said something. I don't know if it counts as something special in Emperor Su's words."

Su Yu smiled, "What did he say?"

After so many years, to remember even after death, it must have been a deep memory.

The Undead Emperor thought for a moment before saying, "He seemed to say... 'Born a few years too late, otherwise, the old guys wouldn't have seized the opportunity!'"

Su Yu was stunned. What kind of statement was that?

Old guys seizing the opportunity, born a few years too late... Who was the Master of the Undead referring to?

To say such words after opening the heavens, clearly, the person mentioned was not simple.

"The Master of Time?"

Su Yu murmured, could it be referring to the Master of Time?

The Master of the Undead was known for his domineering nature, generally looking down on most people. His domineering nature was evident from his Death Path, where he alone reigned supreme.

The Undead Emperor remembered these words, clearly having pondered them back then. Indeed, when Su Yu murmured, he heard it and quickly nodded, "We speculated the same. He might have been referring to the Master of Time. He opened the heavens later, while the Master of Time opened them earlier. As for seizing the opportunity... we speculated it was some fortuitous encounter that the Master of Time seized because he opened the heavens earlier!"

Su Yu was puzzled, "Then why didn't I feel anything when I opened the heavens?"

After opening the heavens, he didn't sense anything. What opportunity was seized?

The Undead Emperor hesitated, saying nothing.

However, Marquis Tongtian really wanted to say, "Don't you have any self-awareness!"

Your opening of the heavens... you're so weak, what could you possibly sense? Those were true experts opening the heavens. Su Yu should be considered the weakest among those who opened the heavens, just like himself, the weakest among the Gate Clan!

Marquis Tongtian grumbled internally. As the weakest among a group, what are you thinking about?

Look at me, I don't think about anything.

I never think about eating the Heaven Gate or the Gate of Hell.

The words of the Undead Emperor were noted by Su Yu. After the Master of the Undead opened the heavens, he might have sensed something, an opportunity... an opportunity seized by the Master of Time, who came later and couldn't compete.

Thinking of this, Su Yu asked again, "Then where did the Master of the Undead go in the end? Did he die? Was he sealed? Do you know about the Heaven Gate? Since you lived until the ancient times, you should have experienced the end of the Opening Heaven era, right?"

The Undead Emperor shook his head, "I don't know about that, it's too high-level. However..."

He hesitated for a moment but still said, "But as far as I know, after the Master of the Undead opened the heavens and established the Death Realm, he soon disappeared from the world! The end of the Opening Heaven era could be considered a marker of that!"

He further explained, "Actually, not long after he opened the heavens, I fell! I don't know if I should be considered a person of the ancient era, maybe... the end of the Opening Heaven era! After all, in our time, no one would deliberately distinguish between Opening Heaven, ancient times, and such. These are definitions made by later generations!"

Alright!

Indeed, for example, in the current era, who knows how future generations will name and distinguish each era? These are matters for future generations. The people of the time wouldn't say, "This is the ancient era, the ancient times."

Seeing that he didn't know much, although he had witnessed the opening of the heavens by the Master of the Undead, Su Yu wasn't very interested. He hadn't seen it with his own eyes, so asking was pointless. Su Yu straightforwardly said, "Is the Emperor interested in becoming a Death Spirit King?"

The Undead Emperor was silent for a moment. In fact, after breaking the seal, he had no choice. At this moment, seeing Su Yu mention it, he knew it was just a formality. He had no choice!

The Undead Emperor slightly bowed, "It would be an honor! If Your Majesty does not mind, then Chen is willing to accept the position of Death Spirit King!"

Su Yu looked at him and suddenly sighed, "I wonder if I'm leaving some troubles for future generations!"

The Undead Emperor's heart trembled slightly.

Su Yu sighed again, "Back then, you didn't want to submit to the ancient ones, so the ancient powerhouses sealed you! Now, you easily submit to me... actually, this wasn't what I expected!"

Su Yu laughed at himself!

"I laughed at the Culture King and others for being soft-hearted, for leaving hidden dangers for future generations... But when it comes to me, thinking from my perspective, you haven't offended me, and you're willing to submit. Should I kill you for no reason? Then I can only appoint you, but... are you a good person?"

The Undead Emperor felt a bit awkward.

Su Yu sighed again, "If you were a good person, you would have worked for the ancient ones long ago. Why work for me? You just think there are too many ancient powerhouses, and there's no chance of turning the tables, so being sealed is better... And I might die at any time, so you're just going along with it, right?"

"Your Majesty... misunderstood!"

The Undead Emperor awkwardly said, "Your Majesty is an opener of the heavens..."

"The Human Emperor and the Culture King also opened the heavens, so what?"

Su Yu sneered, "Forget it, leave the hidden dangers as they are!"

Su Yu calmly said, "These are matters for after my death. I won't concern myself with posthumous matters! After my death, why care about so much? While I'm alive, don't think about turning the tables!"

With that, Su Yu reached out, and a great seal of heaven and earth appeared once more.

In the next moment, Su Yu held the great seal in his hand, raised it with his right hand, and grasped the chaos with his left. Instantly, strands of the power of the great path penetrated through. Immediately, a path of death erupted with powerful death aura, reflecting on the great seal.

"Appoint Chen as the master of the Death Spirit Realm, conferring the title of Death Spirit King! Decree of the Emperor Yu's Mansion!"

With a few simple words, woven by the rules of myriad paths, they instantly fell into the void. In an instant, the void turned into paper, spontaneously generating a golden book, and Su Yu stamped it with the great seal!

Boom!

A loud noise shook the heavens and earth. On the Human Lord Seal, a map of the Death Realm appeared. In the blink of an eye, a force of fortune was generated.

Su Yu chuckled, "You... are the first to be conferred as a king under my command! I promised a few to be kings, but I never conferred them. Hetu, Lanshan, I promised them, but the Death Spirit King seized the opportunity... I don't know if it's good or bad!"

At this moment, the Undead Emperor received the golden book, feeling something different. Instantly, he understood everything and bowed his head, "Chen of the Death Realm, thanks Your Majesty!"

Su Yu waved his hand dismissively. "No need! Of course, your current title of king is somewhat hollow. After all, I'm not like the Human Emperor and the others! In ancient times, your status as a king would be equivalent to that of a marquis."

He chuckled, "Focus on guarding the Death Realm. Unless I summon you, do not leave it."

"I understand, my liege!" The Undead Emperor was quick to acknowledge. He was indeed a wise one, knowing when to yield. Su Yu could only think that this Undead Emperor was very perceptive.

But then, why hadn't he submitted to the ancients back in the day? It was complicated!

Su Yu decided not to dwell on it. If the Undead Emperor ever rebelled, he would simply deal with him then. For now, this arrangement would have to suffice.

"Go meet your subordinates. There was quite a commotion just now, and the others probably know about it already."

Su Yu had no interest in introducing the undead. He barely knew any of them himself. Besides, with the Undead Emperor's strength, subduing the undead wouldn't be an issue.

The Undead Emperor bowed once more and swiftly flew towards the original East King's domain. He, too, felt a mix of emotions.

...

Once he had left, Marquis Tongtian spoke up, "Your Majesty, you've just conferred a kingship? And you promised me a title as well, but you didn't mention me just now!"

"Did I?" Su Yu laughed lightly.

Marquis Tongtian was exasperated. "Yes, you did! Your Majesty, you haven't forgotten, have you?"

He was certain of it!

Su Yu chuckled, "Really? I recall you asking for it, saying you'd boast about your status after I died... but I don't think I ever agreed to it, did I?"

Marquis Tongtian was speechless. Was that so? He distinctly remembered Su Yu agreeing.

One of them must have remembered incorrectly. Of course, Su Yu didn't care about such things. He laughed, "Let's say I did. But you need to be reliable and talk less. Otherwise, if I confer a title upon you, it will be as the King of Nonsense!"

Marquis Tongtian was utterly speechless. Was that necessary? Such a title was far too unflattering!

"I'll definitely speak less!" Marquis Tongtian nodded seriously, deciding to keep his words to a minimum from now on. After all, he didn't have much to say at the moment.

Su Yu said nothing more, smiling as he walked out of the chaos. He had no time to banter with Tongtian; there were many matters to attend to.

Recently, Su Yu had been very busy! Unlike Hundred Battle and the others, who were idle, Su Yu felt he was born to toil. He muttered to himself about his fate.

...

In Su Yu's world.

When Su Yu returned, the Great Zhou King came to greet him. Seeing Su Yu, he sighed softly, "Your Majesty, today you have shown your might across the Myriad Realms. Even Hundred Battle is in awe of you. You truly are the strongest Human Lord!"

"Is that your decision?" Su Yu smiled faintly. "Whether I'm the strongest or not, is that for you to decide?"

The Great Zhou King wasn't embarrassed, his smile radiant. "It's the will of the people, the decision of the Human Race! You are the emperor, while others can only be kings!"

Su Yu scoffed, "The Martial Emperor is still an emperor!"

What was the point of saying that? He was still beaten by the Martial King! And beaten badly, too! It was utterly inhumane.

Speaking of which, Su Yu was genuinely curious. He suddenly asked, "What grudge does the Martial King have against the Martial Emperor? Not only did he seal him, but he also broke his legs and buried him headfirst in the ground. This grudge seems quite deep. What's the story?"

Before the Great Zhou King could respond, Su Yu interjected, "Tell me the truth. I want to hear some gossip. My mood was ruined by Hundred Battle today. If I don't hear some gossip, I'll make some up myself, and the target will be you, Great Zhou King!"

Damn! The Great Zhou King cursed inwardly. Wasn't this a threat?

Yes, it was definitely a threat! Creating gossip was clearly a sign of hostility towards him!

He was somewhat helpless. You won a great victory today, yet you're still in a bad mood. If you're like this, what about Hundred Battle?

Thinking of this, the Great Zhou King was even more helpless. He hesitated before saying, "Let me think... I seem to have heard some gossip. Of course, I can't be sure if it's true!"

The Great Zhou King appeared to be recalling something. Su Yu strongly suspected he was pretending! This guy probably knew but just didn't want to say. Only by pressing him would he reveal some truth.

Su Yu was indeed curious. What kind of grudge did the Martial Emperor and Martial King have? Humiliation... was unnecessary, right? Strong individuals rarely humiliate other strong individuals. Humiliating the weak was even more unnecessary.

The Great Zhou King pondered for a while before saying, "It's said... just said, mind you! The Martial Emperor and Martial King indeed have some enmity. This enmity... is not easy to explain, so the outside world isn't too clear. I only heard it mentioned occasionally..."

Su Yu snapped, "Cut the crap. Yes, it's all hearsay. It's not like you're one of the parties involved!"

The Great Zhou King was speechless. That was a loaded statement. Forget it, I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

He quickly continued, "I heard someone say that the Martial Emperor might have slept with the Martial King's wife."

"......"

Su Yu was stunned. "Really?"

"Ahem!" The Great Zhou King coughed awkwardly. "I just heard it. I don't know if it's true. Even the Martial Emperor might not know! It's quite a secret and somewhat complicated. I heard it was during the early unification of the ancients when the Martial King was still weak. He had a childhood sweetheart... sort of a betrothal from birth, I guess? Something like that. Later, the Martial King went out to learn the Dao and made friends with the Culture King and others, then fought all over... and didn't return for many years!"

"When the Martial King finally achieved fame and fortune, he thought he had a future and returned home in glory, wanting to find his childhood sweetheart. He later learned that she had been taken by the Martial Emperor's people! Taken... might not be the right word. It's hard to say!"

"The Martial Emperor was a dominant figure back then, one of the top three in the Human Race. He had a harem, and the Martial King's childhood sweetheart was... well, she was offered to the Martial Emperor by the locals... so the Martial Emperor might not have known about this, and the Martial King's childhood sweetheart might not have known her childhood sweetheart was the Martial King... that's roughly the situation."

"After defeating the Martial Emperor, the Martial King found out that his childhood sweetheart had apparently died, so he took his anger out on the Martial Emperor and humiliated him severely after defeating him!"

Su Yu was surprised and shocked. After a long pause, he said, "No way... the Martial King's taste... it's said, just said, mind you, to be similar to Marquis Giant Axe! Does that mean the Martial Emperor had similar taste?"

This gossip was juicy!

The Great Zhou King chuckled dryly. "Well, during that period, frail women who couldn't fight or battle often represented mere eye candy, offering no help. So the aesthetic standards of that time were different from now!"

Alright, I get it!

Su Yu murmured, "If it's a grudge over a stolen wife, that explains it. If it were me, I'd want to kill the Martial Emperor too, let alone just seal him!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "You'd need a wife for that, Your Majesty. I doubt you'll ever have such a grudge with anyone!"

Bang!

Su Yu suddenly punched him in the eye, instantly turning the Great Zhou King's eye into a black circle resembling the moon in March.

Su Yu snorted, "Are you mocking me or what?"

The Great Zhou King felt exhausted! You just wanted to hit me, didn't you? I already guessed your intentions!

He didn't bother saying anything more and quickly asked, "Your Majesty, what about the Martial Emperor?"

As for the black eye, it would fade soon enough!

But when he saw Su Yu recording it, he felt utterly drained. You really are something else, hitting me and then recording it. Have some shame, will you?

Su Yu didn't care. He had just heard some big gossip! His mood instantly brightened!

Of course, this matter needed verification and might not be true. However, I'd rather it be true. Such gossip is juicy and dramatic. If it were for other reasons, like the Martial Emperor killing the Martial King's brother or having humiliated him before... that would be boring!

Drama makes for good gossip!

Su Yu, in a good mood, quickly headed deeper into his world. As he walked, he said, "He's been locked up for many years. He's probably run off by now! He's been locked up even longer than Heavendoom and the others. Once released, he's likely vanished! But once he's done wandering, he'll probably come looking for me. He still owes me three rulers of laws!"

The Great Zhou King nodded and asked, "Your Majesty, are you really going to take action against the Myriad Races? If so, helping the Divine Empress continue her path is just inviting trouble."

That would be cultivating a strong enemy!

"The Myriad Races must be fought, but there's strategy in fighting!"

Su Yu smiled, "As for the Divine Empress, I have my plans! I said I wouldn't attack the Sin Clan, but I never said the Myriad Races wouldn't attack the Sin Clan, right? That's their business, not mine."

The Great Zhou King was moved!

Su Yu smiled faintly, "I also said I wouldn't accept the Myriad Races' surrender or allegiance. That's the truth. The hatred is irreconcilable! In the past five hundred years, how many of our people have died? I think, Great Zhou King, you know better than I do!"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a moment, then nodded. "Many have died."

Many, many!

A sea of blood and deep hatred!

Su Yu continued, "My words have actually cut off the Myriad Races' retreat, forcing them to fight to the death! But even in a death battle, there's a difference! Is it a death battle with me, or with the Sin Clan, entering the Gate of Hell, seeking an opportunity, and then finding a chance to break out?"

The Great Zhou King was deeply shaken!

Su Yu squinted his eyes and said softly, "Do you think I'm harder to deal with, or is the Sin Clan harder to deal with? The Sin Clan can enter the Gate of Hell, but can they? They probably can! Once inside, is the danger greater, or is it more dangerous to be surrounded and killed by me outside?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Of course, it depends on their judgment! Maybe they think I'm easier to deal with, and they'll choose to fight me to the death. I don't mind that!"

The Great Zhou King now fully understood Su Yu's intentions!

Su Yu wanted to drive wolves to devour tigers!

The key was, it was still very difficult.

Moreover, the Gate of Hell was extremely dangerous. Would the Myriad Races choose to kill the Sin Clan, break into the Gate of Hell for a slim chance of survival, or fight Su Yu to the death?

This was something even Su Yu couldn't be sure of.

"But didn't Your Majesty say you wouldn't let the Myriad Races interfere with Hundred Battle's fight against the Sin Clan?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Myriad Races won't harass Hundred Battle but will deal with the Sin Clan. That doesn't conflict with what I said! What do you think?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and nodded.

Su Yu continued, "It's a dog-eat-dog world, and we're not going to get involved in their fight, are we? That would be a waste of time! Hundred Battle should be thanking me for lending him a hand!"

The Great Zhou King wasn't sure if Hundred Battle would be grateful, but he knew that if he were, he'd probably be thanking Su Yu's entire family!

Su Yu was once again ready to act inhumanely!

He was an expert at exploiting the virtuous!

At this moment, looking at Hundred Battle, it was clear that he was indeed much kinder than Su Yu. Su Yu truly had a heart of darkness!
