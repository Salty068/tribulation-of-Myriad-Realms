Chapter 715: The Valiant General

The Great Zhou King observed Su Yu deep in thought and pondered for a moment before speaking, "Emperor Yu, we've finally managed to divert the attention of the myriad races to Chaos Mountain. If we act now, unless we can conceal our identities, it will only give Chaos Mountain a chance to regroup."

Once identities are exposed, the plan against the Dragon Race will be ruined. The myriad races will soon realize there's another force in the Upper Realm.

He continued, "Even if we attack, the myriad races will wonder why Chaos Mountain is acting so frequently. Could there be a trap?"

"Moreover, I suspect Chaos Mountain has spies in the Upper Realm!" the Great Zhou King said gravely. "Pretending once is fine, but if they discover our identities after two or three times, it will be a huge problem."

In any case, it's not easy to attack! Attacking risks exposing our identities and is too dangerous. Marquis Giant Bamboo has presented the humans with a significant challenge this time.

The Great Ming King also spoke solemnly, "I think it's not wise to act now. It's too easy to lose the advantage we've just gained. Marquis Giant Bamboo has set these conditions within ten days. I suspect he wants more than just to see our strength!"

It's actually more difficult than expected. Is there hope in killing three Daofuse Realm experts? Yes, there is! And not a small one. If necessary, Su Yu, Lantian, and the Great Zhou King could each launch a sneak attack and then retreat. There's a chance of success.

However, the intent is too obvious, and it seems more like stirring up trouble. Killing three Daofuse Realm experts doesn't have much significance. The myriad races aren't all fools. Even if they originally intended to attack Chaos Mountain, they'd reconsider after seeing this!

Grandstar also commented, "What does Marquis Giant Bamboo mean? Emperor Yu should clarify things with him. Now is not the time..."

Su Yu shook his head and smiled, "Wrong. He's a smart man! Marquis Giant Bamboo is a wise and powerful figure. Does killing three Daofuse Realm experts benefit him? In terms of strength, can't we kill three Daofuse Realm experts? He can see that, including our framing of Chaos Mountain, he knows, and even mentioned it himself!"

"Marquis Giant Bamboo wants to see how we handle this. A slight misstep, and it's a mess!"

Su Yu exhaled. Mishandling this could disrupt some of his plans, even if killing a few Daofuse Realm experts isn't a big deal.

"So what does this old fat cat really want?" Lantian mused, "It feels like he wants us to stir up some trouble, give the Control King's lineage a chance to respond. Could this old fat cat be colluding with the Control King's lineage?"

"Colluding?" The Great Zhou King frowned slightly, looking at Su Yu. "Lantian's words... might not be impossible!"

At this moment, asking them to act again seems a bit insincere.

Su Yu sighed, "Collusion... probably not. But observing our methods against the Control King's lineage, that's true! We've always been in the shadows. Marquis Giant Bamboo hopes we can appear openly and see if we can contend with various powers!"

Su Yu continued, smiling, "He wants to be more assured. The Iron Devourer Race is not weak, with two Heavenly King-level experts. Marquis Giant Bamboo has the capital to handle some things. Understandably, a wrong choice could mean the extinction of their race. It's no joke."

Su Yu laughed again, "In the Lower Realm, everyone has seen our methods. In the Upper Realm, to be honest, attacking the Dragon Race was just catching them off guard. Such tactics don't showcase our true abilities!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo hasn't seen Su Yu's prowess. No matter how much September boasts, it's just one-sided. He hopes that at this critical moment, Su Yu and his group can demonstrate their ability to crush the Lower Realm.

Because right now, the myriad races are very vigilant. This is the time to test one's ability to respond, various tactics, courage, and strength.

The Great Zhou King said gravely, "Now, there are three choices! First, Ren Mountain. Second, the Land of Dao Source. Third, the main camps of the three races! Where to attack is a question. Ren Mountain... is actually very dangerous. I even prefer attacking their main camps..."

The Great Zhou King continued, "Also, if we attack, we need a target. Attacking the myriad races for no reason will make them wonder what you're after. Just to show off your muscles? Are you crazy? Even a fool would think there's a problem! If we attack, there must be a reason. What is our goal, and what is our purpose?"

The Great Zhou King analyzed for Su Yu and slowly said, "Attacking the main camps is to kill top experts and seize the power of laws! Attacking Ren Mountain is to disrupt the council alliance of the myriad races! Attacking the Land of Dao Source is the most dangerous... I don't recommend it. If we do, we can use the excuse of freeing the Hundred Battle King!"

Set a goal first! Before doing anything, if you don't have a goal, it seems too abrupt and contrived.

Everyone looked at Su Yu. Where to attack?

Su Yu thought for a while and finally said, "First priority is the Land of Dao Source, second is Ren Mountain, and third is their main camps!"

Everyone was shocked. The Great Zhou King was actually most worried about this scenario. At this moment, his face was somewhat heavy. He knew Su Yu was bold, and with three places to attack, he was more likely to choose the Land of Dao Source.

"We know nothing about the Land of Dao Source!" The Great Zhou King said heavily, "Even if Marquis Dingjun knows everything, it's from six thousand years ago. Six thousand years is enough to change everything! Attacking the Land of Dao Source, in my opinion, is the most dangerous! There might be more than two Heavenly Kings there!"

Su Yu nodded, "I know."

"You know... and yet..." 

Su Yu smiled, "No rush!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled, "Lantian, in the next few days, you're responsible for gathering intelligence on the Land of Dao Source, including Ren Mountain and the main camps of the three races. Get all the information!"

"Understood!" Lantian replied seriously this time.

"Great Ming King!"

"Present!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Ming King, considered for a moment, and said, "You and part of Lantian's avatars, go to Chaos Mountain!"

The Great Ming King frowned, and Su Yu smiled, "Go to Chaos Mountain, stir up some trouble. It's not without danger! First, draw the attention of the myriad races. It's best to lure out a few ancient beasts. Even if they don't come out, create some disturbances in the three regions of Chaos Mountain! You're good with formations, and Lantian is good at muddying the waters. It's best if you can kill one or two ancient beasts and set up some shielding formations."

Saying this, Su Yu hesitated for a moment and said, "The two of you might not be enough... Grandstar, go help them!"

Grandstar's expression was also very serious, and he nodded, "Alright!"

Su Yu looked at the remaining people, with September absent, leaving only the Great Zhou King, Marquis Dingjun, and Chongming.

"Marquis Dingjun..."

Marquis Dingjun looked at Su Yu, and Su Yu looked back at him for a long time before saying heavily, "Are you afraid of death?"

Marquis Dingjun hesitated before saying, "I am, but having lived long enough, I'm not afraid!"

Su Yu smiled, "I have a task for you. Can you complete it?"

"Emperor Yu, command me!"

"Launch surprise attacks on the smaller races! Only you and Chongming!"

Marquis Dingjun's expression changed.

Su Yu said softly, "Surprise attack the smaller races, kill! You don't necessarily have to kill Daofuse Realm experts, but Eternal and Sunmoon Realm experts can be killed! You're an old acquaintance of everyone. Kill some people and leave warnings. Anyone daring to participate in the myriad races' council will be exterminated!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "It's very dangerous. You know how dangerous it is. A slight misstep, and you'll die! Also, I think you're not very wise and might be tricked to death..."

Marquis Dingjun said helplessly, "Emperor Yu, I may not be good at other things, but I'm good at escaping. Otherwise, I wouldn't have survived until now! It's just that there are too many capable people around you, so you don't need my advice!"

Who are you underestimating! This is blatant contempt!

Su Yu laughed, "Stop talking nonsense. Do you dare? Apart from the major races, the Underworld and Phoenix races are not to be trifled with. Mainly target races with no more than three Daofuse Realm experts, kill them so they don't dare to attend any council, kill them so they have to defend themselves! Make the myriad races feel that we don't want them to unite!"

Marquis Dingjun noted everything down and thought for a moment, "Not pursuing the killing of Daofuse Realm experts?"

"Of course not!" Su Yu laughed, "You and Chongming together are just so-so. If you encounter a second-tier Daofuse Realm expert, you can't resist. If you're entangled by a Daofuse Realm expert, you're dead! Instead, avoid the Daofuse Realm experts and kill those below them, the more, the better!"

"Don't kill the Hou Race, Space Ancient Beast Race, or Fate Clan. The rest are fair game!"

Marquis Dingjun nodded and asked, "What if we can kill a Daofuse Realm expert?"

"Give up!" Su Yu laughed, "Because nine out of ten times, it's a trap. If you think you can kill, I think it's mostly a trap! Remember, your goal is not to kill Daofuse Realm experts but to create chaos, making the smaller races live in fear!"

"Understood!"

Marquis Dingjun nodded. This was his first solo mission from Su Yu, though Chongming was his subordinate, so that didn't count.

"Everyone, take a Lantian with you!"

"..."

For a moment, everyone's expressions turned strange.

Su Yu laughed, "It's not easy to communicate in the Upper Realm. I'm also worried that messages might be intercepted. After all, the communication system in the Upper Realm wasn't built by us. It's too easy for the myriad races to intercept and decipher! Everyone taking a Lantian is fine. Just a few avatars, Lantian doesn't lack them, and it facilitates communication and connection. Lantian can sense his avatars within a certain range."

Marquis Dingjun was actually reluctant because Lantian was quite abnormal. But since Su Yu said so, he had no choice.

And Lantian, with a bright smile, transformed into a little girl and jumped onto Marquis Dingjun, whose face turned ashen. I don't like children, please go away!

Su Yu laughed, "Stop fooling around, transform into something else!"

The little girl Lantian was a bit unwilling, pouting. After a while, she puffed up her cheeks and transformed into a spiritual herb, planting herself on Marquis Dingjun's head.

Marquis Dingjun was helpless. Truly annoying!

The others also found themselves surrounded by various objects—stones, plants, and in Grandstar's case, a toad perched atop his head! Grandstar felt that Blue Sky was deliberately mocking him. "I'm not a toad!" he grumbled internally. "I'm a Fishhead Monster!" Clearly, Blue Sky remembered the time at Soul Burying Mountain when he ate bugs and now thought of him as a toad.

"Alright, let's move out. The area around Marquis Dingjun is the most dangerous. Concealing our presence won't work, so let's hope for the best," Blue Sky announced.

Marquis Dingjun felt a chill at these words, as if he was being sent to his doom. Soon, everyone dispersed.

...

Only the Great Zhou King remained by Su Yu's side. The Great Zhou King looked at Su Yu and softly asked, "What should we do?"

Su Yu smiled, "We're going to meet some people."

"Meet people?"

"Yes, some powerful human experts," Su Yu chuckled. "If we can persuade them, great. If not, we'll capture them! And if we can't capture them, we'll force them to reveal themselves so the myriad races can deal with them, disrupting the Upper Realm!"

The Great Zhou King inhaled sharply, "Isn't that a bit ruthless?"

Su Yu shook his head, "Not ruthless! If they listen, that's ideal. If not, this is the only way. These people are already interfering with some of my plans. I didn't bring Marquis Dingjun along because I didn't want him involved in this, and I trust the Great Zhou King is a wise man!"

Su Yu sighed, "I have no interest in exterminating the humans of the Upper Realm, nor in subjugating them. But these guys, they're disobedient, solely focused on rescuing the Hundred Battle King... They think they're doing nothing wrong, but they're interfering with me! Especially after our battle with the Dragon Race, they seem to see an opportunity, eager to rush to the Source of the Dao to rescue the Hundred Battle King... I'm not afraid of anything else, but I'm worried that when I reach the Source of the Dao, I'll remain hidden, only to be exposed by these people!"

Su Yu sighed again.

The Great Zhou King also smiled wryly, "They don't know our situation. If they really rush to the Source of the Dao, it's not intentional."

"I know."

Su Yu nodded, "But this kind of ignorance and meddling is even more troublesome for me!"

Su Yu shook his head, "We must resolve this! Otherwise, this issue will continue to haunt us, creating significant problems and disadvantages for us later on!"

"But these guys are not weak!"

The Great Zhou King said gravely, "And there are only two of us. They're in dangerous places, and even the myriad races find it hard to deal with them. If we make a move, it might be the same!"

"Let's not count Marquis Shadow for now. There's also Marquis Zhennan, Marquis Huoyun, Marquis Yunshui, and General Yingwu."

Su Yu smiled, "Let's start with General Yingwu. She should be the weakest, right? It's best to resolve them within seven days, then find a way to deal with the myriad races!"

The Great Zhou King quickly pondered.

Su Yu was very likely still planning to deal with the experts at the Source of the Dao, which was extremely risky. If something went wrong...

As he was thinking, Su Yu said softly, "Don't worry. Don't forget, I still have a trump card, someone from the Control King's lineage. At a critical moment, she can still be used! Whether to frame someone, to set a trap, or even to use as an explosive, she can be extremely useful!"

The Great Zhou King was shocked, speaking in a low voice, "If you kill her... the Control King's lineage will know it's someone from the lower realm!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "They'll know... so what?"

Su Yu said softly, "They'll know, but the person is indeed one of theirs, isn't she?"

Su Yu toyed with a piece of black jade in his hand, speaking softly, "If they know, they know. Besides, if this item breaks, could it attract a strong person to respond? If it can... then everything will be confirmed!"

Su Yu mused, "Holding a trump card, a Heavenly King-level expert, if she dies... do you think the myriad races will think it's a joke? Do you think the myriad races won't investigate thoroughly to find out the origin? At that time, if the Control King's lineage says it's someone from the lower realm... so what?"

This is a Heavenly King!

Not some small figure. If such a strong person dies, the myriad races will definitely investigate thoroughly.

Of course, Su Yu hadn't perfected the specific plan yet.

As they walked, Su Yu continued, "This time, she must be used well! This identity would be too wasteful not to use!"

The Great Zhou King nodded.

The identity of the West King's Consort was indeed very useful.

A genuine member of the Control King's lineage, a Heavenly King-level expert!

"To unseal the Hundred Battle King, it can't be done without her involvement!"

Su Yu smiled, "And while we're at it, let's probe the Hundred Battle King's bottom line, see what's at the Source of the Dao, and also..."

Su Yu said gravely, "At the Source of the Dao, there might be a way back to the lower realm."

"A passage?"

"No, the River of Time!"

Su Yu speculated, "The River of Time should have an opening over there, but it must be far from the lower realm. I'm not sure exactly where. Normally, a Heavenly King probably can't return to the lower realm, otherwise, someone would have tried long ago."

"But I've opened the Heaven Gate, so maybe I can sense it, see where the pen dao is, and whether I can return to the lower realm! If I can... the Source of the Dao will be accessible, and there's nothing to fear!"

"It's just a pity that I've burned too much of my lifespan, otherwise, no matter how far, I'd dare to venture!"

Su Yu laughed, "Even if it doesn't work, the pen dao should be sensed over there. I've recently gained some insights into the Great Dao. Even if I can't leave, improving my strength would be nice."

"Congratulations, Emperor Yu!"

The Great Zhou King felt a sense of awe. Another breakthrough, this guy is truly a monster.

Su Yu waved his hand, "Let's go, to Yixian Gorge. I wonder if we can meet this General Yingwu. I heard she's a woman... Women are troublesome, especially those who have lived for over a hundred thousand years."

The Great Zhou King was speechless.

"Do you know her?"

Su Yu asked, and the Great Zhou King nodded, "I've met her a few times."

"Do you know her hobbies?"

"Hobbies?"

The Great Zhou King shook his head; he really didn't know.

Su Yu laughed again, "Who was General Yingwu under before?"

"She was under the Radiant King."

"Does she admire the Culture King?"

"That... I'm not sure. Most female generals from that era admired the Culture King, I suppose."

Su Yu pondered, and the Great Zhou King suddenly thought of something, feeling a bit awkward, "Ahem, um... you're not planning to... that's not appropriate, is it?"

Su Yu laughed, "Planning what?"

"Seduction?"

The Great Zhou King whispered, even if she admired the Culture King, you shouldn't do that.

It's not appropriate!

Su Yu sneered, "Am I that low-level?"

"Then... acknowledging a master?"

The Great Zhou King inhaled, "That's really not appropriate. The South King is one thing, but if you do it again... if the Culture King ever returns, I think you might... you might have to deal with that..."

The Culture King isn't here, but you can't play like this.

Out of nowhere, you're giving him a bunch of partners.

"No, General Yingwu isn't worth that kind of price."

Su Yu said calmly, "In this world, it's all about whether it's worth it! The South King is powerful and guards the Death Realm; she's worth my scheming. General Yingwu... not quite worth it yet!"

Very straightforward, but also factual.

Su Yu said indifferently, "Why would I give myself so many mothers-in-law for no reason?"

"The South King can't enter the Realm of Living Beings, so I don't mind giving her some honor. But General Yingwu, she's still a remnant of the Hundred Battle King. If I give her enough honor, and people take it seriously, making her the Culture King's partner, then if I, Su Yu, deal with her or the Hundred Battle King, wouldn't it be like burning bridges, even going against the Culture King?"

The Great Zhou King remained silent.

Su Yu, this guy, really calculates everything clearly.

Calling someone 'master's wife' isn't something just anyone can do.

He had overthought it.

The two quickly flew towards Yixian Gorge. Yixian Gorge was also in the southern region. Among the human experts, only Marquis Yunshui wasn't in the south; the others were all in the southern region.

Divine Fire Mountain, Tiankuling, and Yixian Gorge were all there.

...

Yixian Gorge.

One of the southern perilous areas.

Easy to defend, hard to attack. Two enormous mountains closed together, forming a perilous area, a narrow gorge.

And these two mountains were located in the sea.

There were also some sea creatures present.

The main passage was a massive waterfall, said to have been created when the humans developed the Upper Realm, accidentally piercing the sky, causing chaotic water to fall from the chaos above.

For countless years, it had never dried up, continuously pouring down, submerging part of the two mountains.

There was only one main passage, but inside, it was a labyrinth of paths.

Once you enter, it's incredibly dangerous.

And yet, from the outside, it's hard to find other entrances.

General Yingwu had been stationed here for three thousand years. The myriad races knew she was inside and had attacked several times, but suffered heavy losses.

Two thousand years ago, a Heavenly King personally led a team inside, but before they could find General Yingwu, they were attacked by some creatures inside, losing several Daofuse Realm experts.

Since then, few dared to enter Yixian Gorge, and General Yingwu rarely came out, if ever.

Those unaware might think she had already perished.

...

Su Yu and the Great Zhou King soon arrived at Yixian Gorge.

From a distance, they could see the towering waterfall crashing down. The Great Zhou King glanced at it, feeling a bit strange, and looked at Su Yu. Su Yu nodded slightly, "It resembles the Time Waterfall at Starfall Mountain, but this isn't a Time Waterfall; it's a stream formed by chaotic power..."

Su Yu watched for a while, then smiled, "Interesting, does this place connect to chaos above?"

He looked up at the sky, pondering, "So, above the Upper Realm, there might be another sky!"

"Chaos!"

Su Yu laughed, "This is getting interesting. The sky is truly layered! The Death Realm, the myriad realms, the Upper Realm, and above the Upper Realm, perhaps still chaos... If we say this world was once a murky expanse, and if the Time Dao once had a master, he opened up the myriad realms! Many years later, the master of the Death Dao opened the Death Realm, and after some more years, humans came to open the Upper Realm... Once humans finish opening the Upper Realm, they continue to open the heavens!"

Su Yu mused, "The world is vast and wondrous. The more I see, the more I realize how small we truly are in the grand scheme of things."

The Great Zhou King felt a pang of resonance with Su Yu's words. "Emperor Yu, are you suggesting that we exist within a chaotic void? In this dark chaos, only the strong can carve out existence, but where do these strong ones come from?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Is there no life in chaos?"

He scooped up a droplet of water and sighed, "Is there no life in this droplet? There is! To the creatures within, this droplet is an entire world. If a creature within grows strong enough, it can break through the droplet, only to discover how vast the world truly is."

Su Yu continued with a smile, "Where do the ancient beasts of chaos come from? Aren't they just lifeforms born from chaos?"

With a sigh, Su Yu added, "If the Culture King and his peers have enemies, the possibility of them being chaotic beings is quite high."

As he spoke, Su Yu gazed at the sky, a sense of awe in his eyes. The more he understood, the smaller he felt. Observing the heavens, he realized they were beyond comprehension.

The Great Zhou King also felt a deep resonance at this moment. He looked up at the sky, at the rootless water, and at the chaotic water falling from the heavens, and sighed, "Our sky is too small, too low, too limited."

The heavens of the Culture King and his peers were far higher.

He noticed Su Yu looking at the sky, as if seeing many figures, seeing the Human Emperor, seeing the Culture King. They, too, often looked up at the sky in the past. Standing tall, they could see far.

Su Yu might not yet have reached the level of the Culture King in strength, but his vision was constantly expanding.

"Emperor Yu, this place is difficult to enter," the Great Zhou King interrupted Su Yu's contemplation.

This place was difficult for the myriad races to enter, and even for the two of them, it would be easy to get trapped.

Su Yu nodded, "I know. I wasn't planning on going in."

With a smile, Su Yu took out a small stone and his Human Lord Seal, chuckling, "I want to see if General Yingwu is willing to meet me."

The Great Zhou King's expression changed, "This... is unwise! Once you use the Human Lord Seal, General Yingwu might sense your presence. But... the Human Lord... In this era, aside from those from the lower realms, the only one in the upper realm is the Hundred Battle King! If General Yingwu is even slightly clever, she might deduce that someone from the lower realm has come, and that it's the Human Lord from the lower realm!"

If she betrayed them, the consequences would be unimaginable!

The Great Zhou King felt that Su Yu shouldn't take such a risk.

Su Yu calmly replied, "If she can sense my presence, I can also quickly sense hers! This way... finding her will be much simpler! If her heart is with the Human Race, she should meet me, just like Marquis Lanshan did. If her heart is with the Human Race, she should come out to meet the Human Lord of this era, even if she doesn't agree with me!"

"If her heart isn't with the Human Race, if she's a traitor, she might still come to meet me. If she doesn't come... then she's made it clear she doesn't care about the Human Lord, and if that's the case... we'll force our way in, locate her, and eliminate her!"

Su Yu continued calmly, "If she doesn't even want to meet, then what does she consider important? Killing her wouldn't be much of a loss, would it?"

The Great Zhou King looked grave, "I'm worried she won't acknowledge this era's Human Lord."

Su Yu remained calm, "If she doesn't acknowledge it, then we must address the hidden threat. Normally, I wouldn't bother, but now I must! If she doesn't acknowledge it, we must capture or eliminate her. We can't let it go unchecked!"

The Great Zhou King sighed.

Su Yu said no more and glanced at the waterfall, "Let's go in. This way, if we have to act, it won't cause much of a stir outside."

The Great Zhou King said nothing more and followed Su Yu, scouting the area.

There were some sentries here, but not many, and their strength was lacking. These sentries weren't meant to guard against Daofuse cultivators but to prevent weaker beings from entering and exiting the One-Line Gorge, gathering more intelligence and resources for General Yingwu.

Su Yu and the Great Zhou King quickly passed through the waterfall and entered the interior of two large mountains.

As soon as they entered, Su Yu sensed the danger of this place.

A massive crocodile-like beast lunged at them the moment they stepped in. The Great Zhou King casually waved his hand, slicing the beast in two.

Su Yu took a closer look and laughed, "The other side knows someone has entered!"

The Great Zhou King was slightly startled, his eyes gleaming as he examined the sliced beast. He frowned slightly and soon said, "I was a bit careless. This beast seems to be bred."

Who would have thought that a suddenly appearing beast would be artificially bred? Clearly, this was one of General Yingwu's sentries.

Su Yu ignored him, continuing forward as he spoke, "Let's go deeper. There are many such beasts here, all bred, with traces of weak power of laws. It likely permeates the entire One-Line Gorge! General Yingwu is quite skilled. This is her defensive line. As you kill your way through, she knows where you came from and where you're headed..."

"As long as there's life, these beasts will actively attack you, making them hard to guard against! If you kill them, she knows where you are. If you don't, she still knows! No wonder she's been able to escape multiple sieges."

Su Yu chuckled, "Interesting. But... I don't think I even need to use the Human Lord Seal. These beasts have their advantages and disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage is that to connect these beasts, there's a trace of weak power of laws linking them. Normally, people can't see the power of laws. Do you think I can see it?"

The Great Zhou King laughed upon hearing this. Su Yu had opened the Heaven Gate!

General Yingwu had linked a trace of power of laws to these beasts. While the sentries were top-notch, they also exposed her hiding place.

The Great Zhou King sighed, "With the Heaven Gate, many things are no longer secrets. Traps, seals, all have traces of power of laws. Without the power of laws, they pose little threat to us. With it, they can be discovered... In this world, there are those who can kill Emperor Yu, but assassinating him is probably impossible!"

To kill Su Yu, one would have to do it openly.

Ambushing, scheming, assassinating him were laughable in Su Yu's eyes.

The Heaven Gate... this thing was too powerful!

When Su Yu opened 720 acupoints and reached the stage of comprehending the Great Dao, he felt it wasn't very useful. But in reality, the Heaven Gate had helped him more than anything else, including his comprehension of the Great Dao. With the Heaven Gate, everything was twice as effective with half the effort.

Su Yu said nothing, his Heaven Gate open, observing the myriad beasts scattered along the small paths around them.

Each of these beasts had an almost invisible thread on them.

"General Yingwu... is quite a formidable figure."

Su Yu followed the threads to their convergence point, explaining as he walked, "Her Dao is interesting, and her control isn't weak! She can disperse it into thousands of threads. It doesn't feel like she's a brute; she might be as strong as or even stronger than Marquis Dingjun! Her understanding of the Great Dao isn't shallow!"

As Su Yu walked, he continued to explain, "To disperse into so many strands... she's a master of control!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "According to Emperor Yu's assessment, she is indeed not weak!"

"She's the only surviving Human Race titled general. So many marquises have died, yet the titled general still lives and has reached Daofuse. That says a lot!"

Su Yu chuckled, "She's already noticed us and seems to be preparing to retreat. Let's give her a scare and play along."

...

At the same time.

Deep within the One-Line Gorge.

Beneath a pitch-black waterbed, through the water and past the massive rocks, a vast space suddenly appeared.

At this moment, a spirited female general's expression suddenly changed!

Someone was here!

Not only were they here, but they were heading straight for her hiding place.

Coincidence?

Accident?

Or... do they really know where she is?

"Gather!"

With a soft command from General Yingwu, soldiers clad in armor quickly converged from all directions.

Upon closer inspection, there were over ten thousand of them.

Far more than what Marquis Dingjun had.

Among them were many female generals, also more than Marquis Dingjun had.

General Yingwu's expression was grave. In her perception, the enemy was closing in on her position, avoiding all illusions, dangers, and forks in the path.

Not only that, but in the One-Line Gorge, there were several powerful native creatures. Yet, the invading enemy easily avoided them, as if they knew where the dangers lay!

Some of these dangerous spots were known to General Yingwu only after paying a significant price.

She had chosen this hiding place because reaching her would mean passing through those dangerous areas.

However, today's invader seemed even more terrifying than the quasi-king from two thousand years ago. They advanced without fighting or pausing, heading directly for her.

Too familiar!

Too familiar with the One-Line Gorge's layout.

General Yingwu's expression changed. Had she been betrayed?

Was it?

If not betrayed, why did the invader head straight here?

But some of the dangers, she hadn't told anyone!

For a moment, she couldn't figure out the situation, but she knew danger was imminent.

"Enter!"

With a wave of her hand, a massive flag unfurled, opening a giant mouth. Beside her, a deputy general with a clear voice said, "My lord, is there an enemy? Shall I lead the troops to intercept..."

"Enter!"

General Yingwu barked sharply!

Sweat began to bead on her forehead.

Too fast!

The enemy was rapidly approaching her hiding place, unbelievably fast.

Damn it!

Could the perilous One-Line Gorge not even slow them down?

Seeing this, the others also sensed the urgency and quickly entered the flag's space.

General Yingwu swiftly put away the flag, glanced at the treasured hiding place she had occupied for years with some reluctance, but had no choice but to flee. The enemy knew where she was!

She quickly slipped out of her hiding place, silently merging into the small paths along the gorge.

However, after moving for a while, her face turned pale. In her perception, the enemy was heading straight for her current location.

"Impossible!"

General Yingwu was shocked.

Why?

Could it be... someone brought a tracking device?

She glanced at the flag in her hand, her expression a mix of anger and disbelief. Could it be... someone among her own people was carrying a tracking device, allowing the enemy to find her again and again?

"If that's the case..."

She looked at the flag with a hint of struggle. If that were true, she couldn't take these people with her. Otherwise, she wouldn't escape death.

"Let's try again!"

She continued to flee, but no matter how she tried, she couldn't shake off her pursuers. Through the beasts, she could sense that the enemy was always following her.

"Damn it!"

General Yingwu cursed inwardly. She had been betrayed! Someone had pinpointed her location; otherwise, this wouldn't be happening!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu chuckled, "She must be questioning her life right now!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Emperor Yu... your interests are quite peculiar. If she gets desperate and thinks she's been betrayed, she might kill her subordinates. That wouldn't be good."

"Don't push it too far!"

Su Yu laughed, "No, I just want to test her character! What do you think? Is she the type to sacrifice her pawns to save the king? Would she abandon her subordinates? If she does, will she hide them or kill them all to prevent exposure? If she hides them, she's wise. If she kills them, she's ruthless but lacks humanity..."

The Great Zhou King frowned, "Emperor Yu, you've said before that human nature isn't worth testing."

"Why bother?"

Su Yu smiled, "It's fine. I can sense her power of laws. If she makes a move, I'll shake the Human Lord Seal, and she'll know it wasn't her subordinates who betrayed her!"

Such a wicked sense of humor!

The Great Zhou King silently criticized.

Just then, Su Yu paused, then laughed, "Guess what she's doing now?"

"What?"

"It seems she's hidden her people, but... she hasn't run. She's actually planning to counterattack me, hiding near where she stashed her people!"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "Bold move. She thinks she's been tracked, so she hides among her subordinates, ready to deliver a fatal blow?"

"That's probably it."

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "She's got guts and nerve, not afraid of facing a Heavenly King?"

"If it really were a Heavenly King, she'd have to gamble. Otherwise, losing all her subordinates and escaping alone might not give her a chance to rise again."

"True."

The two chatted leisurely, enjoying the conversation.

Soon, they approached an entrance. Su Yu saw it clearly—a power of laws hidden beneath the chaotic waters below, waters that carried a corrosive force.

At this moment, General Yingwu lay in ambush within the water, using no protective power to avoid creating any energy fluctuations. She waited silently, like a predator hunting its prey, waiting for the enemy to appear. Since they had caught up to her, she would seize the opportunity to kill them.

She kept her eyes open, letting the water corrode them, refusing to blink as she watched the passage outside. Two figures gradually came into view.

"Just a bit closer..."

General Yingwu thought, just a bit closer.

As she prayed, the two figures stopped.

Su Yu looked toward the fork in the path and laughed, "Great Zhou King, how long do you think it would take for someone to cry if they were corroded by this chaotic water without using any power, relying only on their physical body?"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "After all, she's at the Daofuse Realm. Crying... seems unlikely, right?"

Su Yu grinned, "True, but I think it might be quite painful!"

Then he laughed again, "Right now, she's probably thinking, 'What are they talking about? Why aren't they getting closer? Damn it, if they don't come closer, I'm going to lose it.'"

In the water, General Yingwu's heart trembled violently.

Who are they talking about?

That's exactly what I was thinking!

Su Yu, with a mischievous tone, said, "Now, she's definitely thinking, 'Who are they talking about? Have I been discovered? Impossible!'"

"Impossible!"

General Yingwu's heart trembled again. Impossible, they couldn't have discovered me unless they placed a tracking device on me!

Su Yu laughed, "She must be thinking, 'Did they put a tracking device on me? No way, I didn't bring anything. Maybe I should just ditch my weapon...'"

"Courting death!"

At that moment, General Yingwu could no longer hold back!

She had been discovered, and the other party was deliberately mocking her!

Unbearable, she wanted to kill them!

Her heart was in turmoil. How could they have discovered her? Impossible! Where did it go wrong?

With these thoughts, she attacked. It was a sword, but as it was unleashed, it transformed into a myriad of swords, countless powers of laws controlling the long sword, aiming to kill Su Yu.

Su Yu quickly assessed—third-tier Daofuse Realm!

Not weak at all. This was a titled general, representing an ancient power, yet she had reached the third-tier Daofuse Realm, comparable to Marquis Dingjun. Truly impressive.

"Impudent!"

The Great Zhou King shouted softly, "Stop!"

General Yingwu hesitated slightly. Stop? Why should I stop?

The next moment, a large seal appeared before Su Yu, exuding a faint glow. At this moment, General Yingwu's eyes changed, feeling a sense of closeness, oppression, and shock!

This... this is... the Human Lord Seal?

Human Lord!

With some shock, she suddenly looked at Su Yu, instantly retracting her sword, stepping back with confusion and shock.

Human Lord?

Where did this Human Lord come from?

The Human Lord Seal could only be used by the Human Lord themselves or those granted permission. No one else could wield it!

This... is this the Human Lord?

From which era?

At this moment, General Yingwu was bewildered, shocked, delighted, frowning, suspicious...

A myriad of emotions erupted.

This bastard who deliberately mocked me is the Human Lord?

Why haven't I seen him before!

She quickly retreated, extremely cautious, looking at Su Yu, then at the Great Zhou King, with some doubt. Soon, her eyes changed again, looking at the Great Zhou King, hesitating, "Zhou Tiansheng?"

The Great Zhou King was surprised, "You recognize me?"

"I'd recognize you even if you turned to ashes!"

General Yingwu coldly said, "The last tide, the first time I saw you, I felt something was off and asked the Hundred Battle King to investigate you, but no one paid attention. As expected, you had issues!"

The Great Zhou King inhaled sharply. How could this be!

Women, terrifying creatures.

No wonder Su Yu doesn't involve himself with women. Even Marquis Lanshan is dead, and the first glance at me, she says she recognizes me. Damn it, I've changed my aura and appearance, and she still recognizes me, even in death!

And now, General Yingwu recognizes me too.

But Marquis Dingjun, that fool, spent a long time with me, only remembering me after I introduced myself.

Is this the difference between men and women?

For a moment, the Great Zhou King felt complicated. Su Yu avoiding women made so much sense!

Meanwhile, General Yingwu was quickly thinking.

Zhou Tiansheng... saw him during the last tide.

Then who is this beside Zhou Tiansheng?

Human Lord?

From this tide?

No, Zhou Tiansheng seems to be from the lower realm. Why is he here?

For a moment, her eyes flickered uncertainly. The lower realm!

These two... are from the lower realm?

Su Yu glanced at the Great Zhou King, sighing. Why are all the people who recognize you women? How many women have you offended?

Truly pitiful!
