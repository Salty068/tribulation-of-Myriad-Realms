Chapter 862: Never Surrender! (Please Subscribe)

The Demon Emperor is dead.

A top-tier powerhouse from ancient times has fallen just like that. The Demon Race had more than one Demon Emperor, and the one killed today was the third-generation Demon Emperor. The first-generation Demon Emperor, if counted from the end of the Primordial Era, was killed by the Martial Emperor, who had mentioned it once. The second, the Flame Demon Emperor, had long disappeared, rumored to have entered the Gate of Hell with the Control King.

The one before them now was the third-generation Demon Emperor. And this one was the most formidable, at least for now. In the ancient era, powerhouses roamed freely, and the Flame Demon Emperor's abdication had its reasons, including strength. Anyone who reached the first tier was no weakling. Yet now, he was dead.

...

The Immortal Emperor was shaken, and the Divine Emperor was horrified. However, there was still hope. Yes, even with the death of a first-tier powerhouse, the myriad races still had a chance. Over thirty powerhouses had already arrived, right before their eyes. Once they joined the fray, they could reverse the situation.

No matter how strong Su Yu and the Great Zhou King were, two first-tier powerhouses couldn't handle over thirty rulers of laws. Perhaps the Human Emperor at his peak could, but the Human Emperor wasn't here now. Even though most of those arriving were third or fourth-tier, with few second-tier among them, they could still deal with two first-tier powerhouses. Especially since the Demon Emperor was already dead, they only needed to deal with one.

The Immortal Emperor couldn't care less anymore and roared, "Kill! Kill Su Yu, and we can win!"

As long as Su Yu was killed, victory was still possible. They could definitely win!

The Immortal Emperor roared madly, and the Divine Emperor also shouted, his divine fists shaking the heavens and earth, forcing Su Yu to retreat continuously. Over there, the Great Zhou King and his group, after killing the Demon Emperor, hesitated for a moment.

Should they go help Su Yu?

But Su Yu's voice was cold, filled with icy determination, "Go kill the Immortal Emperor, all of you!"

With that command, everyone was shocked.

The Great Zhou King understood his intent, including the Book Spirit, King Yue, and even the Martial Emperor. Perhaps, it was four first-tier powerhouses against a severely injured Immortal Emperor!

What was Su Yu thinking?

He couldn't handle it here!

The Great Zhou King hesitated, but the next moment, he gritted his teeth and roared, "Kill!"

They bypassed the over thirty powerhouses and charged straight for the Immortal Emperor.

The Immortal Emperor, heavily injured, had a slight change in expression but immediately shouted, "Continue the assault!"

With those words, the four directions trembled.

Several powerhouses were going to kill the heavily injured Immortal Emperor, yet he didn't call for reinforcements. He was a ruthless one!

Clearly, he was gambling on whether his people would kill Su Yu first or if the Great Zhou King and his group would kill him first. Whoever died first would lose!

Su Yu wanted to kill him, which wasn't surprising. Even the Human Emperor wanted him dead. Who wouldn't want him dead?

As a supreme powerhouse of the Life Path, his existence was terrifying. Without him, the thirty-plus injured rulers of laws couldn't recover so quickly!

Both Su Yu and the Immortal Emperor were the core keys for their respective sides. The Human Emperor's severe injury last time was due to an attempt to kill the Immortal Emperor, which led to unforeseen changes and problems.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King and his group gritted their teeth and charged madly towards that direction!

Meanwhile, on Su Yu's side, the Divine Emperor's face was cold. Su Yu was insane.

He was gambling his life with the Immortal Emperor, betting on who would die first!

But you don't understand the Immortal Emperor well enough; you have no chance!

The Demon Emperor's death had shocked him. But as long as the Immortal Emperor was alive, it wasn't a complete defeat. Even if heavily injured, everyone had a chance to recover.

Moreover, how could you, Su Yu, withstand over thirty rulers of laws?

Do you really think you're a supreme powerhouse?

In other directions, battles raged on, true bloodbaths, with the sounds of slaughter shaking the heavens, and people constantly falling.

At this time, behind the Divine Emperor, everyone had arrived.

The moment they arrived, countless powers of the Great Dao swept towards Su Yu!

Die!

No matter how strong you are, Su Yu, you're just one person!

Moreover, the Divine Emperor is here!

In an instant, several people panicked. Su Yu's side was in a frenzy. So many powerhouses, they couldn't handle it!

It's over!

It's really over!

However, at that moment, Su Yu's expression was cold. Suddenly, he reached out, and a giant pen appeared before him. With a stroke, two figures emerged on the giant pen.

At this moment, the two of them wielded the giant pen and charged out instantly!

Pen Dao!

The Pen Dao from the River of Time!

The Pen Dao emerged, incomparably powerful, sweeping across the world, shocking the Divine Emperor!

And that wasn't all. At this moment, beneath Su Yu's world, a pitch-black Ink Dao spread out, with both pen and ink appearing simultaneously, the Ink Dao sweeping across the world.

Liu Hong's eerie voice came, "Commander of the Dark Division, Liu Hong, greets you all!"

Su Yu remained silent.

The power of the world continued to spread, and in the blink of an eye, figures appeared one after another.

Great Daos manifested!

"Commander of the Dark Division, Zhu Tiandao, greets you all!"

A low chuckle echoed, and formations appeared between heaven and earth.

"Commander of the Dark Division, Lord Xia, greets you all!"

At this moment, powerhouses emerged from the nearby Great Daos, yes, from the Great Daos!

Not only that, but some of these people also had remnants of Heaven Gates appearing on them. At this moment, Su Yu connected the power of the Heaven Gates, and the power of the five powerhouses on the other side of the Heaven Gates suddenly augmented those few people.

These few were either first-tier or second-tier. Su Yu had been reluctant to draw upon their power before, but now, with the summoning, their power was greatly enhanced. While the augmentation for Su Yu wasn't significant, for these people, it was immense.

The Great Dao trembled, and each powerhouse's body cracked, only to recover instantly.

Because they no longer had physical bodies.

Merging with the Dao!

I am the Dao, and the Dao is me!

"Chief Commander of the Dark Division, Xia Wushen, greets you all, with respect!"

A blade aura swept across the world!

Counting the Pen Dao, the Pen Dao with Nan Wujiang and Yun Chen counted as one, making it exactly five, corresponding to the five paths within the Heaven Gates!

The Dark Division!

But... it didn't seem very dark!

Five Great Daos: pen, ink, symbol, flesh, and blade!

At this moment, five forces seeped out from Su Yu, and the power transmitted by the first-tier returnees was enough to create second-tier peak powerhouses, or second-tier middle, second-tier peak powerhouses. The transmitted power was enough to create third-tier peak powerhouses.

In just a blink of an eye, five great powerhouses seemed to emerge from the Great Dao... and they did!

They were hiding within the Great Dao, suddenly striking. With a swift slash, a blade light flickered, and among the thirty-plus powerhouses, one had his head severed instantly by the sudden attack.

The Ink Dao, like a loach, spread through the river, sweeping in and dragging one into the depths, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

The Pen Dao was the strongest!

This was the Culture King's renowned Great Dao, a first-tier Dao. With a single stroke, it directly killed a ruler of laws at the forefront, shattering them into pieces!

In just a blink of an eye, three rulers of laws were killed.

Lord Xia and Zhu Tiandao were slightly weaker, even with borrowed power, only reaching third-tier. But at this moment, the two collaborated, instantly trapping one in a formation, countless talismans exploding.

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed, and the one trapped in the formation was blown to pieces.

In an instant!

In just an instant, five people arrived, suddenly appearing and killing four powerhouses. The few powerhouses at the forefront, the Divine Emperor was forced back by a slash from Su Yu, and the remaining few were killed on the spot by the sudden appearance of the five!

The Divine Emperor was still retreating, his face changing drastically!

Dead!

Su Yu's side still had people!

"Pen Dao?"

The Divine Emperor's face turned ashen, looking at the Great Dao transformed into a giant pen, gritting his teeth, "Merging with the Dao to become spirits, how ruthless! Su Yu, you're truly ruthless!"

Merging with the Dao to become spirits!

He was a top-tier existence and instantly saw through it. Su Yu had actually merged these people into spirits with the Dao, and not only that, he had borrowed other powers, the Heaven Gates!

At this moment, the Divine Emperor saw through it.

Suddenly, his face turned ugly.

Four were killed!

The main issue was morale, the unstoppable morale!

Previously, over thirty powerhouses charged with overwhelming strength, determined to kill Su Yu. But who would have thought that Su Yu had ambushed several powerhouses, suddenly appearing and killing the few at the forefront!

As a result, the morale of the others was instantly hit, stopping them in their tracks, fearing more people would suddenly appear, their faces changing.

Are there more?

How many powerhouses has Su Yu created?

No more!

Su Yu assured, no more, just these. Moreover, Lord Xia and Zhu Tiandao weren't even rulers of laws; they only merged with the Dao, and with the borrowed power from the Heaven Gates, they barely had such strength.

Moreover, if not for merging with the Dao, with the Dao as their bodies, the power transmitted by the Heaven Gates' powerhouses would have killed them instantly!

Now, they couldn't be killed.

Because they were the Dao!

Unless the opponent could explode the Dao!

As for the few, they all called themselves commanders, but Su Yu didn't care. Call themselves whatever they liked.

At this moment, Su Yu's face was calm, looking at the opposite side, indifferent, "Too weak, too few. My people... are not just these... continue!"

At this moment, behind him, more figures appeared.

The Divine Emperor's eyes narrowed, and the next moment, he roared angrily, "Bastard, fake, kill him!"

Boom!

He was the first to punch out, a powerful divine force erupting, and with one punch, the phantoms behind Su Yu exploded!

Yes, fake.

Just to scare people!

In the end, the Divine Emperor wasn't fooled. Su Yu was disappointed. You weren't fooled, and not only that, you exposed me!

Su Yu quickly retreated, and the five merged Dao powerhouses swiftly withdrew, guarding in front of him.

Su Yu grinned, "Everyone... coming out to fight immediately, a top-tier battle, isn't it thrilling?"

There were many dark guards, but unfortunately, others couldn't appear for now. Their strength wasn't enough, and there was no one to borrow power from. Without borrowed power, what use were some Daofuse and Heavenly Kings?

Here, they were just waiting to die.

These five, with strong merged Daos, and with the borrowed power from the five Heaven Gates powerhouses, could become rulers of laws.

Others couldn't!

The Divine Emperor ignored Su Yu and, with a cold expression, shouted, "Kill!"

One Su Yu, plus a few rulers of laws, still wasn't enough!

Su Yu sighed, and soon, he laughed, "Then... battle!"

Boom!

The power of myriad paths converged, merging into Su Yu's body, instantly amplifying his aura. Numerous Su Yu avatars emerged, appearing from the River of Time. Some were pages, others were pages Su Yu hadn't taken away, continuously drawing upon the power of the Great Dao.

Opposite him, within the Daos of over thirty powerful beings, it seemed as though there were people, with their strength being siphoned away by Su Yu!

Su Yu's aura surged, and with a swift kick, time spun around him!

Breaking through mountains and seas, suppressing the Sunmoon Realm, defeating the invincible...

The time techniques of the past, now under Su Yu's feet, were even more formidable. Life and death cycled, time reversed, and with a single kick, the Divine Emperor staggered back a step. Yet, divine power erupted, shattering Su Yu's strength, and he charged forward once more.

Su Yu grinned, "Everyone... hold on! Let's see who dies first!"

At that moment, behind him, the Immortal Emperor and the Great Zhou King clashed.

The Great Zhou King had been injured earlier, and now, his first-tier strength was unstable. Meanwhile, Yue Wang and the Book Spirit were only second-tier. Even though the Immortal Emperor was heavily wounded, he held his ground against them.

Over there, the Martial Emperor suddenly roared, his aura skyrocketing as he charged at the Immortal Emperor!

With the Martial Emperor's arrival, the Immortal Emperor's expression changed.

However, he believed he could endure longer than Su Yu!

On Su Yu's side, in the blink of an eye, they collided, engaging in fierce combat!

Their numbers were far too few.

In the blink of an eye, a clash ensued, and two Daos trembled violently, even beginning to crack. That was Lord Xia Hou and Zhu Tiandao, who were suddenly besieged by multiple opponents, struggling to hold on!

Meanwhile, Su Yu, with a fierce shout, faced five opponents: the Divine Emperor and four second-tier experts, all of whom were targeting him. Their sole objective was to kill Su Yu!

Surround and kill Su Yu!

Only by killing Su Yu would this battle end. Killing others was inconsequential.

At this moment, Su Yu also demonstrated the might of an opener!

He was ruthless and versatile. As a second-tier expert approached, their vision suddenly blurred, as if they had fallen into hell. The others joined forces to attack, only to see their companion suddenly freeze.

In the next instant, a terrifying scene unfolded. Su Yu's body transformed into a massive shroud, enveloping several of them. Just as the Divine Emperor was about to strike, boom!

A thunderous explosion echoed as Su Yu's body shattered!

Yet, the blast left several second-tier experts with cracked bodies. The one who seemed to have fallen into hell just regained clarity when Su Yu suddenly transformed into a dog. It was his willpower manifesting, borrowing the Dao!

Or rather, using his own Dao.

In the distance, Fat Ball had just repelled an enemy when it suddenly went limp, falling down. It turned to look at Su Yu, muttering, "What are you doing?"

Su Yu had transformed into a dog, a black dog, the Sun-Eating Divine Hound, immensely powerful. With a single bite, there was a crunch, and the heavily injured second-tier expert's Dao was severed!

The Divine Emperor's expression changed. As he attacked again, Su Yu vanished, reappearing further away. Xia Longwu's expression also changed, retreating hastily, feeling powerless. Su Yu transformed into a blade, slashing out, a cold light illuminating the heavens and earth!

With one slash, there was a squelch, and another second-tier expert was cleaved in two!

"They say mastering one Dao can make you invincible. Today, I'll show you that mastering myriad Daos is the true king!"

Su Yu's cold voice echoed. In the next moment, he suddenly lamented, "Your Majesty, I've waited for you for countless years... Are you truly so heartless?"

In the distance, Wan Tiansheng also suddenly went limp.

The Divine Emperor's eyes flickered with confusion, "Empress..."

The words slipped out before his expression changed!

"Monster!"

He roared, divine light radiating in all directions. Su Yu, this monster, was terrifying!

But Su Yu had already vanished. The giant axe in the hands of the Giant Axe suddenly disappeared, reappearing in Su Yu's hands. With a single chop, another second-tier expert was reduced to dust!

"I too can merge with the Dao of Heaven and Earth... I am the spirit of Heaven and Earth, the Dao is mine, I am the Dao... Abandoning the physical body... I will only grow stronger!"

Su Yu's cold voice echoed, and the Divine Emperor's heart trembled!

Su Yu was truly mad!

He had directly exploded his own body, severely injuring four second-tier experts. In the blink of an eye, he had used various Daos to kill three second-tier experts. It was known that three second-tier experts could rival a first-tier one.

But facing Su Yu, an opener who could wield various Daos with ease, the three were almost instantly killed by him!

He let out a low shout, punching forward, flattening the area ahead!

However, Su Yu had already vanished, reappearing before the last second-tier expert. The expert's expression changed drastically, and the Divine Emperor's heart chilled. This couldn't go on.

Su Yu wasn't dead yet, and on his side, so many experts were instead being killed by Su Yu's side.

His methods were not as numerous as Su Yu's!

Today's Su Yu displayed the terror of an opener!

The Divine Emperor let out a low roar, "Immortal Emperor!"

The Immortal Emperor, engaged in a fierce battle with several experts, felt a jolt in his heart. He instantly understood the Divine Emperor's intent!

Destroy Su Yu's Heaven and Earth!

Kill Su Yu!

At that moment, Su Yu also roughly guessed some things, but he couldn't retreat. He gritted his teeth, chuckling, "Book Spirit, Yue Shan..."

In that instant, the Book Spirit and Yue Shan's auras surged, reaching first-tier!

Four first-tier experts!

The Immortal Emperor's expression changed drastically!

At that moment, he was also extremely shocked, but he still made a choice, letting out a fierce roar, "Explode, remember... only by killing Su Yu can we survive..."

Boom!

Over there, in the blink of an eye, four first-tier experts, insanely charged at him, shattering the Life Dao continuously!

On Su Yu's side, those besieging them suddenly felt their Daos tremble. Some showed expressions of terror, realizing something in the next moment, and screamed, "Immortal Emperor!"

The Immortal Emperor had betrayed them!

They didn't want to die!

At that moment, Su Yu laughed, grabbing Lord Xia Hou and the others. In the next moment, he appeared before the fleeing Divine Emperor, chuckling, "Why run?"

He instantly sealed this piece of Heaven and Earth, looking at the experts he had sealed together, smiling, "Come, the Divine Emperor and Immortal Emperor want you dead. Let's see, will you explode more, or hate them more... Let's see, between me and the Divine Emperor, who dies first?"

The Divine Emperor punched through the seal, attempting to escape again, but Su Yu hugged him, smiling faintly, "Let's die together, otherwise, don't even think about it! Together, we might be able to stop the self-destructive power and survive... Otherwise, let's die together!"

"Su Yu!"

The Divine Emperor roared, punching Su Yu's head, causing it to crack.

Su Yu didn't care, smiling brightly, his cracked head instantly healing, chuckling, "How foolish, here, I transform into a spirit. As long as Heaven and Earth remain, I am immortal. You think killing me is that simple?"

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed through Heaven and Earth, as someone's Dao trembled uncontrollably, unable to maintain itself any longer, exploding with a thunderous roar. A powerful force swept through, but Su Yu's voice suppressed the sound of the explosion, filled with madness and laughter, "Kill, kill them all. If I don't die, I'll come for you!"

Boom!

The explosions continued!

At this moment, on the periphery, the Radiant King and others turned pale. The Radiant King's face changed completely, his eyes bloodshot, "You forced me!"

He hadn't wanted this, but they forced him!

A massive Dao appeared instantly, and the Radiant King gritted his teeth. Killing a first-tier expert wasn't easy, even though he was much stronger than the Spirit Emperor. But to kill the opponent, he had to engage in a fierce battle.

But now...

There was no time!

"Boss... I can't follow you anymore..."

The Radiant King looked desolate, "Boss, I... might have to change my allegiance!"

The Radiant King grabbed his own Dao, transforming it into a formation, trapping the Spirit Emperor within. With a loud boom, it suppressed everything, overshadowing the explosions on Su Yu's side, boom!

A powerful first-tier Dao shattered into pieces!

Heaven and Earth trembled!

As if a mighty being had fallen!

The Radiant King spat out blood continuously, yet he grinned, grabbing at the void, pulling out a broken sea of will, which was the Spirit Emperor!

The Radiant King didn't care, grabbing the Spirit Emperor's sea of will, instantly appearing before the Great Ming King. The Great Ming King had just killed his opponent and hadn't had time to speak when the Radiant King shouted, "Make way!"

"..."

The Great Ming King was stunned, but in the next moment, he understood, gritting his teeth, hurriedly severing his connection with the formation Dao.

The Radiant King roared, connecting the Heaven and Earth Dao to himself, his aura skyrocketing, stabilizing Su Yu's Heaven and Earth, which had been trembling from the explosions!

But with his connection to the Dao, it stabilized significantly.

All of this happened so fast it was dizzying.

In the next moment, the Radiant King punched, shattering the sea of will in his hand, exploding with a thunderous roar. Countless source qi and willpower swept through Heaven and Earth. The Spirit Emperor's voice echoed, filled with despair, "You're mad... you're a first-tier..."

You actually severed your own Dao, merging into Su Yu's Heaven and Earth!

Now, you've likely lost the hope of being a first-tier. You were already a powerhouse with over twenty Daos, and you severed your own Dao. Are you mad?

The Radiant King gritted his teeth, "Am I mad?"

I've been driven mad!

A bunch of lunatics forced me!

I didn't want this either. I wanted to wait for the boss to perfect things before considering it. But Su Yu, that lunatic, he actually hoped the Divine Emperor would join him to stabilize Heaven and Earth. This lunatic, isn't he afraid the Divine Emperor isn't afraid to die, insisting on mutual destruction?

He had no choice but to make this decision!

Not only that, he roared, "Zhan Wang, look at your ancestor, sever your Dao, merge your Dao, hurry!"

Stabilize Su Yu's Heaven and Earth!

Zhan Wang, this fool, widened his eyes, "Look at your ancestor?"

Your ancestor died long ago!

Zhan Wang was speechless, but in an instant, he severed his own Dao. Countless powers of laws instantly merged into Su Yu's Heaven and Earth, helping Su Yu stabilize it, because Su Yu, that lunatic, was self-imprisoning with the Divine Emperor and others, amidst the madness of explosions!

Heaven and Earth trembled violently, and under Su Yu's command, everyone was going mad, unleashing their final strength to slay their formidable foes!

They couldn't stop the collapse of Su Yu's power of laws! If this continued, it might even lead to the collapse of Su Yu's entire world!

In an instant, the Hundred Battle King merged into the Dao, while the Radiant King roared, and a grand formation suddenly appeared. He quickly inserted the remnants of the Spirit Emperor's core into it, then reached out to grab the Great Ming King, who had just vacated the formation's Great Dao. With a dazed look from the Great Ming King, the Radiant King extracted a formation from his body—the very one he had gifted to the Great Ming King last time. Yet, he still maintained control over it.

Seeing the Great Ming King's gaze, he roared, "What are you looking at? Your ancestor? This is mine, and I can't take it back?"

With those words, the grand formation instantly appeared! It was a stabilizing formation, perfectly suited for the current situation, to stabilize the world. His madness was unparalleled as he continuously set up formations, showcasing the immense power of the Four Extremes Human Kings!

He wasn't one to seek the limelight, but that didn't mean he was weak. Well, among the Four Extremes Human Kings, his strength indeed wasn't top-tier.

From self-destructing the Great Dao, severing the Great Dao, severely injuring the Spirit Emperor, taking over the Great Ming King's formation Great Dao, to setting up a stabilizing formation with the Spirit Emperor's sea of will as the core—it was all done in one go without any delay!

At that moment, a tremendous force erupted, and the phenomenon of the world's collapse appeared!

Simultaneously, the Spirit Emperor's final scream echoed, and with a loud bang, the Radiant King's formation appeared, burning away everything of the Spirit Emperor. A stabilizing formation instantly manifested within Su Yu's world, stabilizing the collapsing world!

The Radiant King continuously spat blood, his body and Great Dao cracking, yet he laughed, and amidst his laughter, he cursed.

"Damn it! What a trap!"

And at that moment, another earth-shattering explosion resounded!

Boom!

The sound of explosions rose again, and Su Yu's laughter echoed, "Divine Emperor, thank you!"

Two figures were blasted away, the Divine Emperor's body shattered, his face pale as he flew backward, quickly retreating!

Gravely injured and near death!

At the last moment, several powerful beings self-destructed, and the Divine Emperor, to survive, had to join forces with Su Yu to withstand the aftermath. Together, they barely managed to block the deadly aftermath!

But those powerful beings exploded one after another, and the power of their self-destruction nearly caused Su Yu's world to collapse!

The Radiant King, during this period, stabilized Su Yu's world!

In an instant, Su Yu appeared, battered and broken!

Yet, he wore a radiant smile, as if he felt nothing, as if he didn't realize he had just been on the brink of life and death. The Radiant King couldn't help but curse, "Damn you, you idiot, you almost got yourself killed..."

This was madness!

An idiot!

He almost died!

If you died, did you know that those rulers of laws might all perish?

And Su Yu, with a peculiar expression, glanced at him and cursed back, "Idiot, sever your damn Dao..."

The Radiant King was stunned!

In the distance, Xingyue's figure suddenly appeared, looking bewildered, "Do you still want to extract the Life and Death Path?"

"..."

What did that mean?

The Radiant King was taken aback, but Su Yu quickly regained his smile, "Thank you, Radiant King. Fortunately, I was prepared. If only the Life and Death Path remained, and everyone else was crippled, we could all join the Human Emperor... Luckily, thank you!"

"......"

Yes, at the last moment, Su Yu had already planned for the collapse of his world, to extract the Life and Death Path, leaving only the Life and Death Dao. As for the people, he would try to save them. If he could save them, perhaps the Human Emperor would come, and they could all join the Human Emperor, who still had hundreds of unused Great Daos.

Even if he had to abandon everyone on his side... even if only the Life and Death remained, perhaps it would be a form of liberation.

He wouldn't need to care for them anymore!

In the end, he didn't even need to use Xingyue, as the Radiant King decisively chose to sever his own powerful formation Dao of over twenty paths, and even called upon the Hundred Battle King to stabilize Su Yu's world.

At this moment, Su Yu didn't know what to say.

He truly hadn't expected this to happen, yet it did!

The Human Emperor's people, the Four Extremes Human Kings, truly lived up to their reputation!

This decisive power, even Su Yu hadn't considered that the Radiant King and the Hundred Battle King would choose to merge their Dao into his world at this moment... even though they forcibly took over the Great Ming King's Dao!

Forget it, the Great Ming King... either he relies on his ancestor, or he can only go to the Human Emperor!

Or, find a way to get it back?

That's possible too!

The Radiant King was slightly dazed, but seeing Xingyue, he roughly understood that Su Yu might not die, but if the world collapsed, with only two paths left, even if he didn't die, Su Yu would be crippled!

This madman, with this mindset, dragged the Divine Emperor along to withstand it?

Everything happened too quickly.

And at that moment, a shrill roar echoed in all directions!

"Retreat, follow the Divine Emperor... Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether, follow the Divine Emperor... everyone retreat... go... go upstream... wait for the Three Gates to open!"

The Immortal Emperor's shadow appeared, shaking the heavens, with a sense of determination, he poured all the power within the Great Dao into the fleeing Divine Emperor, roaring, "Take everyone and leave... I failed..."

He had misjudged!

This was Su Yu's trap!

He wanted to use the lives of over thirty rulers of laws to exchange for Su Yu's life, but he failed!

On Su Yu's side, there were actually several hidden first-class beings!

The fleeing Divine Emperor's aura instantly recovered, but his expression changed drastically. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and turned back, and in an instant, divine power erupted again. With a punch, he forced the Suppressing Martial King back, grabbed the Dragon Emperor, and together they approached the Radiant King's consort. Her face changed, and she instantly retreated.

The Phoenix Emperor also withdrew, and in the distance, the Nether Emperor began retreating the moment the Hundred Battle King merged into the Dao.

The Divine Emperor ignored him; that guy was greedy for life and feared death, and it was hard for him to die.

His divine power erupted, and nearby, the myriad races' powerhouses, all incredibly brave, instantly repelled their opponents. The Divine Emperor shouted, "Retreat!"

Boom!

A group of people quickly retreated, and Su Yu coldly shouted, "Kill, chase them!"

At that moment, a loud explosion resounded!

The Immortal Emperor, controlling the last remnants of the Life Dao, suddenly exploded, not targeting anyone, but the River of Time. A monstrous wave surged between the myriad races and the human race!

The Immortal Emperor's Great Dao continuously collapsed, his face somewhat desolate, "I don't understand you enough... otherwise... I might not have lost this battle... Su Yu... this time, I lost..."

Su Yu's expression changed slightly, this guy was beyond his imagination!

The weak of the myriad races might be greedy for life and fear death, but these top existences were beyond his imagination.

The Divine Emperor returned to aid, the Immortal Emperor self-destructed his Dao, severing everything to cover their retreat. This suddenly reminded him of the Yue King!

The Immortal Emperor had a chance to escape!

And the Divine Emperor, just now returning to aid, also surprised Su Yu. He wasn't scared off but came back, risking being surrounded, to rescue the Dragon and Phoenix Emperors!

"Myriad races... Immortal race..."

Su Yu murmured, and the Immortal Emperor's Great Dao collapsed, raising a monstrous wave that blocked all the pursuing powerhouses, even forcing the Yue King and others to retreat.

The Immortal Emperor's shadow wavered, with some helplessness, some dejection, looking at Su Yu, then at the distant starlight, which seemed to be the Human Emperor.

He laughed!

"Human Emperor, Su Yu, I lost... but you can't kill us all... if you keep killing... break the seal of the River of Time, the Three Gates will open immediately... hahaha... do you want them to open now?"

The Immortal Emperor alone blocked the river, laughed, then looked at Su Yu, smiling, "Did my Immortal race also lose to you in the Myriad Realms?"

Su Yu slightly raised his eyebrows, "Tiangu ran away with his people!"

"Tiangu?"

The Immortal Emperor murmured, laughed, "Not bad! Just a pity... sigh... that fool insisted on cultivating my path back then, otherwise, he wouldn't have easily lost to you..."

He spoke, looking at those fleeing powerhouses behind him, watching them flow against the current.

At this moment, the Divine Emperor turned his head, looking at him, with some sorrow, some desolation, shouting, "Rest assured, if I don't die, the Immortal and Divine will be one, I will protect the Immortal race!"

"Thank you!"

The Immortal Emperor laughed heartily, then turned back, looking at the distant Human Emperor rushing over, sighed, "Fought for countless years... didn't die by your hand... still a bit unwilling... Su Yu... died at the hands of the younger generation... really unwilling... Human Emperor... send me off, will you?"

The Human Emperor rushed over quickly, soon stepping into Su Yu's camp, with some fatigue, panting, his strength not much improved, even somewhat unstable, he was too anxious.

At this moment, he came alone, the others hadn't arrived yet.

Seeing the giant wave breaking the River of Time, his expression changed slightly, then looked at the Immortal Emperor's shadow, his eyes also changed, soon, he nodded slightly, looked at Su Yu, "I'll send him off, I've fought him for too many years... though I've always toyed with him, these people are just enemies, not cowards!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

The Human Emperor stepped forward, quickly flying towards the Immortal Emperor's shadow, and the Immortal Emperor's shadow also laughed heartily, throwing a punch at the Human Emperor!

The Human Emperor roared, going all out, throwing a punch!

Boom!

A loud noise echoed, the Immortal Emperor's shadow completely dissipated, a trace of life intent scattered into the world, scattered into the river, with some relief, some carefree, "In the end, I still lost to you... the ancient grudges spreading to this day... end here! Xingyu... thank you... let me tell you a little secret..."

At this moment, the Immortal Emperor was very carefree, his body long gone, only a trace of willpower floating in the world, his voice somewhat ethereal, "The Human Gate truly exists, among the Three Gates, the Human Gate is the most treacherous..."

The voice grew smaller and smaller!

Gradually disappearing.

Finally, a faint voice echoed, with laughter, "Born as an immortal, immortal, eternal life! Humans, residing on high mountains, overlooking the mundane, transcending humanity, are immortals..."

Boom!

The world trembled as this formidable presence bought enough time for the Divine Emperor and his allies to make their swift escape. The will of the Immortal Emperor dissipated entirely into the heavens and earth.

The Immortal Emperor had fallen!

In a single battle, three top-tier experts met their end: the Demon Emperor perished, the Immortal Emperor fell, and the Divine Emperor fled. As for the Spirit Emperor, he died silently, slain by the Radiant King, but in his final moments, he stabilized Su Yu's world.

Rumbling echoed as waves surged to the sky!

...

In the Myriad Realms.

The Immortal Realm was in turmoil, the heavens collapsing and the earth shattering. The ancient Immortal Emperor had fallen. The Immortal Race, a proud race unwilling to be subjugated, stood tall. Immortals, dwelling atop mountains, were the true Immortals.

High above, how could they be constrained by the Human Race? In the war of the Myriad Races, the Immortal Race constantly incited conflict, serving as the core force of the Myriad Races and the main force resisting the Human Race, always leading the charge in battle!

Today, the Immortal Emperor, who had resisted the Human Race since ancient times, fell within the River of Time.

...

Beyond the Earth Gate.

Just after the Human Emperor's strike, Tiangu suddenly felt a pang of fear. He looked at the others, and at that moment, the Origin Saint's body trembled violently. The next moment, his aura surged, but Tiangu felt no joy. His lips quivered, his eyes vacant. His teacher, that mighty figure who had traversed the world... had fallen!

Su Yu!

The Origin Saint's face turned ashen as he looked at Tiangu. Suddenly, he let out a bitter laugh, grabbing Tiangu as the power of the Great Dao continuously flowed into him. He cried softly, "I... cannot bear such a heavy burden... You... you can... Junior Brother, this responsibility... is too great, too heavy... Master... is gone!"

Tiangu was speechless, like a puppet, his body stiff, silent. That guy was dead... I once thought, if I hadn't followed your path, perhaps I would have found my own... I thought you harmed me, I thought, why didn't you warn me sooner... Today, perhaps... I understand.

Did you know this day would come eventually?

He forced a rigid smile, painfully stiff.

"Su Yu..."

He murmured, filled with despair and pain. How can I defeat you?

Immortal Race, where do we go from here?

This mountainous burden, how can I bear it?

Master, you're gone, what if I can't bear it?

He looked around at the Immortal Race experts, the Origin Saint, the Saint Marquis, the Desolate Heavenly Venerable... and those Immortal Race experts brought into the Earth Gate, all dejected, sorrowful, and despairing, looking at him with an emotion... called hope!

At this moment, Tiangu closed his eyes.

The next moment, he opened them abruptly, all sadness and despair concealed, speaking calmly, "From today, I am the Immortal Emperor, the sole emperor of the Immortal Race! Immortals stand above others, Immortals never submit!"

Never submit!

Su Yu, I will lead the Immortal Race to fight you to the end, even if my race perishes, Immortals will never submit to the Human Race. We stand high above!

Tiangu laughed heartily!

Yes, Immortals are like this, lofty and unreachable!
