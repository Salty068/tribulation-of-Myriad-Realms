Chapter 705: Settling in Chaos Mountain

Upper Realm.

Bright Moon Flower Valley.

Su Yu and his group began their journey toward Chaos Mountain, while Bright Moon Flower Valley gradually filled with powerful figures. From the Demon Race, Marquis Blood Severance had arrived, and Ba Jue had returned as well. Experts from the Immortal, Demon, Dragon, and Nether races were also present.

At this moment, everyone was trying to deduce what had transpired. Two Daofuse experts had died, and no one knew who was responsible. This was a terrifying thought, as it suggested the presence of a top-tier Daofuse or even a Heavenly King-level expert. In the Upper Realm, both Heavenly Kings and quasi-kings were considered to be at the pinnacle of Daofuse, advancing toward the realm of rule masters.

A figure, shrouded in a phantom-like aura, was investigating a low valley, attempting to trace the remnants of time. After a long while, this phantom figure spoke softly, "There was more than one person involved! The enemy first captured or killed Mo Shi Ji here. There are traces of an array in the void, indicating that the enemy is skilled in formations or has an expert in formations among them."

Everyone nodded, acknowledging the accuracy of this assessment.

The phantom figure continued, "Moreover, the enemy likely possesses the ability to conceal heavenly secrets or silence their surroundings. Mo Shi Ji was killed without the nearby experts noticing until it was too late."

The crowd took note of this information.

"Additionally, Marquis Dingjun might not be in league with the enemy."

This statement surprised everyone. Marquis Blood Severance, now less agitated, asked in a deep voice, "Marquis Xunxi, what do you mean by that?"

Marquis Xunxi didn't elaborate further. Instead, he flew to the area where Marquis Dingjun and his group had been, sensing the surroundings before speaking, "I noticed something odd earlier. There's a faint trace here that you might have missed—Marquis Dingjun's spear aura! He had used his spear."

"And Mo Shi Ji wasn't killed by Marquis Dingjun. He was captured or killed outside the gorge, so there was no need for Marquis Dingjun to use his spear again!"

"If that's the case, Marquis Dingjun's target was someone else!"

"Besides Mo Shi Ji, who else would Marquis Dingjun attack?"

This revelation left everyone with peculiar expressions.

Marquis Dingjun might not have been an accomplice but rather captured as well! This hypothesis was contrary to their earlier assumptions. They had thought Marquis Dingjun had cooperated with the mysterious figure to kill Mo Shi Ji.

Marquis Blood Severance asked solemnly, "Are you suggesting that Marquis Dingjun might have been captured and not willingly left with them?"

"Yes!"

Marquis Xunxi nodded slightly. "Furthermore, the enemy is skilled in spatial manipulation and left through a spatial weak point here. It was torn open once and then stabilized."

"The weak point is small, indicating it wasn't torn open by sheer strength."

Marquis Xunxi continued to search for clues, finally concluding, "There were likely four to five individuals, all possessing Daofuse combat strength. Among them, at least two were top-tier Daofuse! They each excelled in different paths. Marquis Dingjun isn't dead, so he was probably captured..."

Marquis Blood Severance's face darkened. "Different paths? Space, formations, silence, sealing—all different powers?"

"Yes!"

Marquis Xunxi nodded again. "At least, that's my current assessment."

Marquis Blood Severance said grimly, "So, it's unlikely to be the Human Race! Since the ancient times, ninety-nine percent of Human Race experts have followed the path of the physical body. Except for some ancient figures who took different paths, later Human Race Daofuse experts almost all followed the physical path."

This was common knowledge across the Myriad Realms. Since the disappearance of the Culture King and others, the path of civilization had been severed, making it difficult for the Human Race to advance. Even if one emerged, it was rare, with perhaps one non-physical path expert appearing per tidal cycle.

Over the years, the Human Race might not have produced four or five experts following different paths. Now, with so many experts skilled in non-physical paths appearing, and Marquis Dingjun possibly captured...

This made it almost certain that the intruders weren't from the Human Race. They were likely experts from another race. In fact, others shared this thought. It wasn't that they hadn't considered the possibility of Human Race reinforcements, but where would the Human Race find so many experts in non-physical paths?

At this moment, an expert from the God Race spoke softly, "Could it be some hidden ancient figures from the Human Race? Currently known ancient Human Race experts are few, but some may have never appeared. Could they have emerged now?"

Marquis Blood Severance sneered, "How convenient! They didn't appear earlier or later, but now?"

The God Race expert replied calmly, "It's not convenience. It's that the Human Race can't hold on any longer. If the ancient figures knew, it's not impossible for them to stand up now."

"Then tell me, which ancient Human Race experts were skilled in these paths?"

Marquis Blood Severance said coldly, "As far as I know, there were Human Race experts skilled in these paths, but... they should all be dead by now!"

This statement was difficult to counter. The God Race expert said no more.

Marquis Blood Severance laughed coldly, "The Upper Realm seems to have quite a few remnants! Or perhaps they're not remnants but think victory is near and are preparing to act in secret?"

Such suspicions were inevitable! Not only Marquis Blood Severance but others present had similar thoughts. First, they dismissed the possibility of Human Race reinforcements. At least, it was highly unlikely. Second, these individuals had captured Marquis Dingjun, possibly to confuse the situation. If Marquis Xunxi hadn't detected faint fluctuations, everyone would have assumed Marquis Dingjun was in league with the enemy.

At this moment, everyone had their own thoughts. If not the Human Race, then who? Which race had the audacity to deploy four to five top-tier experts at once? The Demon Race had lost two Daofuse experts, making it unlikely to be them. Would they kill two of their own Daofuse just to confuse others?

If not the Demon Race, then the Immortal Race, known for their diverse paths, might be involved. An Immortal Race expert present, seeing the silence, guessed their thoughts and calmly said, "Don't suspect my race. We've been focused on dealing with the Lower Realm Human Race! With the fall of Marquis Meteor and King Bing, the Lower Realm Human Race has gained the upper hand. The Immortal Race wouldn't create trouble for ourselves now!"

He looked at Marquis Blood Severance and said calmly, "Perhaps someone is trying to create chaos and fish in troubled waters. Marquis Blood Severance, stay calm and don't fall into a trap!"

Marquis Blood Severance replied coldly, "Don't worry, I'm not that foolish! But... I hope I don't catch any evidence!"

He was frustrated. Was it the Immortal Race? He couldn't be sure, but he decided to keep a close watch on them!

Quickly, he turned to Marquis Xunxi and asked, "Marquis Xunxi, can you track these people?"

"Difficult!"

Marquis Xunxi shook his head. "The enemy was cautious, leaving almost nothing behind. They even cleaned the battlefield before leaving, and an explosion destroyed all remnants!"

Marquis Blood Severance frowned, but Marquis Xunxi soon smiled, "Of course, there might be a way."

"What way?"

Marquis Blood Severance asked urgently, and others also looked over.

"These people are mysterious, but some aren't!"

Marquis Xunxi smiled, "We can focus on Marquis Dingjun! We don't know who the mysterious people are, but Marquis Dingjun is an old acquaintance. We're familiar with his aura, path power, and bloodline. It's not easy to track, but not impossible."

Marquis Blood Severance frowned, "Marquis Dingjun and others aren't easy to track!"

Marquis Xunxi nodded, then chuckled, "It's not easy, but there's a target! Also, why did the enemy capture Marquis Dingjun? Just to kill two Demon Race Daofuse? They were newly advanced, so what's the point?"

"On the Human Race side, besides Marquis Dingjun, a few others are alive, hiding in various perilous places. We even know which perilous place some are in, but they're hard to find..."

Marquis Xunxi smiled, "Do you think these people will act again? If they do, will they attack us directly, or will they use the Human Race to confuse us, capturing them while also killing some from other races, keeping our focus on the Human Race?"

Marquis Blood Severance nodded slightly but soon sneered, "This shouldn't be said openly. I'm afraid someone here might leak information!"

Others remained expressionless. Leak information? That was a difficult topic to address. Who were these people, and which race were they from? It was still unclear. The Demon Race crying thief wasn't impossible!

The Immortal Race expert, uninterested in further discussion, said blandly, "At least one good thing came out of this: Marquis Dingjun's base was raided, and Bright Moon Flower Valley was destroyed. This perilous place no longer exists! The Human Race has one less stronghold in the Upper Realm!"

It was a small consolation. One less Human Race stronghold.

Marquis Blood Severance sneered, saying nothing more. If that's what you think, then so be it.

After some more discussion, Marquis Blood Severance said, "Enough with the nonsense. Speed up the process of locating other Human Race marquises. Find a stronghold to besiege and spread the word. I want to see if these so-called 'Human Race reinforcements' will come to the rescue!"

He smirked, his words carrying a deeper meaning. "If they're Human Race reinforcements, it wouldn't be appropriate for them not to assist when we besiege Human Race experts! With their strength, four to five top-tier experts, they should at least make an appearance, right?"

"As far as I know, Marquis Huoyun, hiding in Divine Fire Mountain, is close to being located!"

The Marquis of Blood Severance let out a cold laugh. "It should be soon. If we can pinpoint the exact location and cut off their escape routes, the various races can join forces for another siege. If it's the Human race reinforcements, they might show up. If someone is secretly stirring up trouble, we can confirm if our suspicions are correct."

The experts from the various races remained silent. On the side of the Immortal Race, the Immortal Marquis couldn't be bothered to look at him. It wasn't the Immortal Race's doing, but whether that was true or not, he wasn't sure. Some matters might only be known to the top echelons.

He quickly said, "I will report this to the Immortal Race Council. The Immortal Race should participate in the siege."

"That would be for the best!"

No one said anything further, and with no clues to follow, their figures gradually faded away, leaving the place.

Once everyone had left, only the Marquis of Blood Severance and Bajue remained. The Marquis of Blood Severance's expression was cold. "It's likely the work of the Immortal Race! Four or five top-tier Daofuse experts, hmph!"

Who else but the Immortal Race could secretly mobilize so many powerful experts?

"What about the God Race?" Bajue asked in a low voice. "Could it be them? The God Race has been very low-key these past years, not making many moves..."

"The God Race..." The Marquis of Blood Severance was silent for a moment before nodding. "It's possible! In any case, this incident is most likely their doing. If the Human race had the strength to retaliate like this, they would have done so thousands of years ago, not waited until now!"

"Four or five top-tier Daofuse experts don't just appear out of nowhere!"

The Marquis of Blood Severance sneered. "And those rumors about ancient Human relics awakening—what a joke. If they existed, they would have appeared long ago. Without the Hundred Battle King unsealed, those relics wouldn't show up."

He scoffed at such theories, dismissing them with disdain. "Saying that is as ridiculous as claiming they came from the Lower Realm."

Bajue chuckled. "The Lower Realm... The Human race there has produced a few strong individuals, but it's said that more allies have emerged, like the Iron Devourer Race, who seem to be supporting the Humans..."

"Forget it!" The Marquis of Blood Severance interrupted. "Let's not complicate matters now. We're aware of the Iron Devourer Race's involvement, but let's focus on eliminating the remnants of the Human race first, to prevent them from joining forces with those remnants."

"Understood!"

Bajue replied, his eyes flickering with thought. He quickly added, "Lord Blood Severance, please put in a good word for me this time. It's not that I was careless, but some bastard deliberately set up the Demon Race..."

He needed to absolve himself of responsibility!

Two Daofuse experts had died, and another had two of his three bodies destroyed. Such a crime was not insignificant. He quickly said, "Lord, if I'm punished by the council, the Demon Race will lose four Daofuse combatants... This is likely what the mastermind wants!"

With two dead and one severely injured, if he were punished or imprisoned, they would indeed lose four Daofuse combatants.

The Marquis of Blood Severance frowned slightly, then snorted coldly, "You're an idiot, a waste! If you're punished, it's deserved!"

After a round of scolding, he quickly added, "Don't worry, even if there's punishment, it will be nominal. They won't actually do anything to you! The council won't weaken its own strength at a time like this."

With these words, Bajue was reassured.

The Marquis of Blood Severance was one of the decision-makers in the council, and with his assurance, Bajue was likely to escape punishment this time.

The council was modeled after ancient structures, with each race having its own council.

In the Demon Race council, there were two levels: the council leader and the council members. Generally, Daofuse experts were council members, while the council leader, according to Su Yu's classification, was at the level of a Heavenly King.

The Marquis of Blood Severance possessed such power, so his voice carried significant weight in the Demon Race council.

The Marquis of Blood Severance stopped scolding and, still pondering other matters, flew for a while before saying, "You did make a mistake this time. I'll try to get the council to give you a chance to atone for your crimes by participating in the siege of the Marquis of Fire Cloud. If you achieve merit, this matter will be settled!"

Bajue had no objections, though he was somewhat worried. "But what if they appear..."

"We have our arrangements!"

"Understood."

...

On this day, there was some discussion in the various Dao fields of the Upper Realm.

The destruction of Bright Moon Flower Valley, the death of two Daofuse experts from the Demon Race, and the disappearance of the Marquis of Steadfast Army, with rumors of four or five top-tier Daofuse experts appearing, made many experts vigilant.

Was the Upper Realm about to descend into chaos?

With the gates to the Upper Realm about to open, was someone trying to stir up trouble at this time?

...

Meanwhile.

In a Dao field of a small race, there were quite a few people, and a large city stood there. This city was the Dao field of a small race's Daofuse expert, and it was quite lively at the moment.

On the wide stone avenue, a powerful figure wearing a black bamboo hat had his ears twitch slightly.

The Marquis of Steadfast Army had disappeared, and two Daofuse experts from the Demon Race had died.

The Marquis of Steadfast Army...

The cloaked figure frowned slightly as he walked down the street, invisible to others.

"The Marquis of Steadfast Army is missing... Was he rescued, or is it a trap?"

This person was the Marquis of Shadows.

He was always a lone wolf, but he had some connections with a few other Human experts and sometimes provided them with intelligence.

At this moment, he was also worried.

He didn't know if this was a trap or something else.

Who would rescue the Marquis of Steadfast Army?

Everyone was busy with their own affairs; who had the time or strength to rescue him?

Could it be a trap set by a major race?

With some concern, he continued forward, quickly disappearing from the street. With the death of Minshan, the whereabouts of the other Human marquises might be exposed. Now that the Marquis of Steadfast Army was missing, who would be next?

Perhaps he could investigate secretly. Even if it was a trap, he had to step in. Otherwise, if the Marquis of Steadfast Army was turned or surrendered, it could lead to a major disaster.

...

"What a massive mountain!"

At this moment, Su Yu didn't care about others. He was leading his group toward Chaos Mountain. After flying for a long time, he saw an enormous mountain range, its outline visible from afar.

As he looked, Su Yu felt a sense of familiarity. The next moment, he exclaimed, "Are all mountains from the era of the Opening of Heaven similar?"

He had seen a mountain before.

On Old Turtle's Dao path!

It seemed to be a mountain, a path opened by Old Turtle's wife, an offensive Dao path, reportedly inspired by a mountain seen in the ancient era.

Could it be this Chaos Mountain?

Or perhaps another similar mountain?

In any case, even from afar, Su Yu could vaguely feel the oppressive and primal aura emanating from the mountain.

Here, the power of the Dao was turbid.

It even radiated to this side.

If the power of laws in the Myriad Realms was like a grid, neat and orderly, then the power of laws in the Upper Realm was like gushing water, somewhat chaotic, but with a general source in one direction.

But the power of laws near Chaos Mountain was interesting; it was a hodgepodge, a mix of all sorts of laws, turbid and chaotic.

With his Heaven Gate open, Su Yu observed for a while. The chaotic power of laws made this place seem as if it had returned to the time when the world first opened.

"The deeper you go, the more turbid it becomes!"

"Perhaps it's not turbid, but this is how it originally was. Before the Opening of Heaven, when the world first opened, perhaps the Dao was like this!"

"The convergence of myriad Daos, or perhaps there was no such thing as a Dao, and opening a Dao was merely to untangle this chaotic mess."

Su Yu realized that his greatest gain from coming to the Upper Realm wasn't who he killed, who he saved, or who he subdued.

It was seeing things he had never seen before!

For instance, the sight of the world at its inception.

In the Lower Realm, you could never see this in a lifetime, as the Lower Realm had developed for so many years and had long been untangled.

The Death Realm was the same; perhaps it was chaotic back then, but it had changed now.

Only in the Upper Realm could he see these things.

As they approached Chaos Mountain, the Great Zhou King and others were somewhat uncomfortable. The Great Zhou King said, "The power of the Dao is chaotic here, interfering with the Dao. It's not a good place for cultivation."

"Wrong!"

Su Yu shook his head. "This place is a good place for seeking the source!"

"Seeking the source?"

The Great Zhou King pondered the meaning of these words. After a moment, he said thoughtfully, "Perhaps you're right. If someone here can gradually peel away the power of laws they need for cultivation, they might gain more insight into the power of the Dao."

Su Yu nodded. "Indeed! Of course, you can't see clearly or understand it, so cultivation here is indeed difficult! But if you can find the source of your Dao amidst the chaos, it will greatly benefit your understanding of the Dao!"

Su Yu sighed. "It's a good place, but it's only suitable for those with exceptional comprehension. Ordinary cultivators should be careful here, as they might be overwhelmed and explode."

Lan Tian chuckled, "I cultivate for the people, and the people love me. No Dao is beyond cultivation!"

Su Yu also laughed. "The Dao of the People is strong, but it's also an untangled Dao. This place is very chaotic, and you'll have to untangle it bit by bit. It's not easy; don't underestimate this place!"

He saw more than others and knew more.

Lan Tian's Dao was good, but untangling the myriad Daos here was also very challenging.

Lan Tian chuckled, "Then it's a fortuitous opportunity. This place is a land of opportunity!"

"Not wrong!"

As they conversed, the group arrived before the mountain range. As they approached, a wild aura hit them in the face!

This wasn't just a mountain; it was an enormous mountain range stretching to the ends of the earth.

At this moment, the Marquis of Steadfast Army took a deep breath and quickly said, "This Chaos Mountain range stretches endlessly. We can't go deep inside. We can only establish a temporary base on some of the smaller peaks on the outskirts! We also need to avoid some powerful ancient beasts, as they are hostile to us..."

Su Yu laughed, "It's not hostility! It's the influence of the power of the Dao..."

The Marquis of Steadfast Army looked at Su Yu. How did he know that?

He seemed to know everything!

Hadn't he just arrived at this place?

Su Yu glanced at the others and smiled, "This place is a cesspool of chaotic paths, while we are like a drop of pure water. When this drop enters the murky water, the surrounding ink will try to taint and assimilate you."

He had seen it. The area was filled with primitive and chaotic forces, eroding them, as if trying to assimilate them. The human paths of Great Zhou King and the others were purified, naturally resisting the invasion, instinctively fighting back.

Su Yu chuckled, "Staying here temporarily is fine, but if you resist too much over time, the ancient beasts around will sense the anomaly and come to investigate. They'll definitely cause trouble for you then!"

This time, Great Zhou King and the others understood. Great Zhou King softly asked, "So, you're suggesting we shouldn't resist?"

"Not resisting is one way, but if you don't resist, you'll easily be eroded by the chaotic paths, making your path impure. Not everyone can walk the path of chaos. Once your path is tainted, there's no hope for further advancement."

For Su Yu, the chaotic forces didn't matter much. He intended to walk the path of unifying myriad paths, reopening them. Corrosion wasn't a big deal, though he'd prefer his pen dao to remain untainted. But not everyone was on this path, which made it troublesome. These chaotic forces were like poison!

The advantage of the Heaven Gate was vividly apparent now. Those who hadn't opened the Heaven Gate would find it hard to detect these things, only knowing they couldn't stay here too long without facing danger and trouble.

Su Yu took a deep breath, fully opening his Heaven Gate. As soon as he entered the mountain range, he sensed countless dangers. With the Heaven Gate open, he quickly scanned the surroundings.

Ahead, there were many small peaks. Each peak seemed close, but in reality, they were separated by thousands of miles. In this chaotic mountain region, the distance wasn't obvious, making them seem nearby.

Su Yu looked at some of the outer peaks and his expression changed. In the void, atop a mountain, a fierce ancient beast appeared—not its true form, but a shadow of the path, murky and mixed with power, yet extremely ferocious!

Sensing someone observing it, the path beast suddenly lunged at Su Yu, seemingly biting at him despite the vast distance. Su Yu quickly shifted his gaze, avoiding the beast.

Having just avoided that one, he saw another path shadow—a crocodile-like beast. As soon as he looked, it swung its tail at him! These were merely instinctive reactions of the path shadows, not the true owners detecting Su Yu's presence. Even so, Su Yu felt a strong sense of threat.

Taking a deep breath, he continued to observe. There were countless outer peaks, many with beast shadows, indicating the possible presence of ancient beasts.

After scanning hundreds of peaks, Su Yu's eyes brightened as he spotted a peak without a beast shadow, seemingly shielded by a barrier against the chaotic forces.

His eyes flickered, and he quickly asked, "Dingjun Marquis, did you say Marquis Anbei survived in these chaotic mountains for over a hundred years?"

"Yes."

"Do you know where his base was?"

"Well..." Dingjun Marquis shook his head, "I really don't know. Even the myriad races couldn't find it because they didn't dare venture deep. There are too many peaks here; who knows where Marquis Anbei hid?"

"Was Marquis Anbei skilled in formations?"

"Uh... not that I've heard of," Dingjun Marquis hesitated, "He wasn't, as far as I know. Marquis Anbei was more adept at physical combat."

Su Yu frowned, "He excelled in physical combat, yet survived here for a century?"

Could the peak he saw, shielded by a formation against chaotic forces, not be Marquis Anbei's base?

Pondering this, Su Yu quickly said, "Follow me. Withdraw your path power and endure some pressure. It's not a big issue!"

This was akin to the dead spirits in the Celestial River of Death withdrawing their path power to avoid detection by Su Yu. Without path power, they'd be in a Sunmoon Realm state, needing a moment to reconnect their paths in a crisis.

Normally, in these perilous chaotic mountains, who would do such a thing? Instead, they'd be extremely vigilant, explosively unleashing their path power, making them more noticeable and targeted.

Marquis Anbei fighting the myriad races here was suicidal. In this place, a battle between several Daofuse cultivators would be extremely conspicuous, attracting ancient beasts.

The others didn't argue. It was dangerous, but since Su Yu said so, they complied. Dingjun Marquis was once again stunned. This was... entrusting their lives to Su Yu!

A group of Daofuse cultivators, including Eternals, withdrew their path power. Now, if they needed to unleash it, it would take time. Su Yu could easily kill them! Even Great Zhou King!

Even if Su Yu didn't kill them, a sudden ancient beast attack could instantly kill them. What charm did Su Yu possess to make these Daofuse cultivators trust him so?

Su Yu said nothing, and neither did the others. What charm? Simply Su Yu's undefeated record, leading them to sweep the lower realm without losses, was enough for them to trust him. Believing in Su Yu was the path to success and victory. Even Great Zhou King firmly believed this. Those who opposed Su Yu were now six feet under.

Without saying much, Su Yu sensed the area, turned, and shouted, "Dingjun Marquis, withdraw!"

Dingjun Marquis looked innocent, "My... path is sealed. I can't use it."

"Oh!" Su Yu nodded, quickly removing some of the divine character seals on his path. Moments later, Dingjun Marquis's strength returned. He looked helpless. If he hadn't spoken up, would they have truly forgotten or pretended to forget?

Helplessly, seeing everyone watching him, he quickly withdrew his path power, though it felt unnatural. He was used to being vigilant after so many years.

Seeing him comply, Su Yu didn't look at him again, swiftly leading the group toward the peak. He didn't use his pen dao, relying solely on his physical strength to fly, while keeping an eye on the chaotic forces to prevent sudden ancient beast attacks. With him around, ambushing him would be difficult.

Though the distance seemed short, it took Su Yu nearly an hour to reach the location he had seen earlier. A small peak, three to four thousand meters high, appeared before them. In these chaotic mountains, it was indeed a small peak.

Rugged and rocky, the peak was covered in stones and some weeds, which were not ordinary, infused with murky rule power, unusable as precious herbs.

They saw no formation, but Su Yu examined it closely, seeing more clearly this time. There was indeed a barrier force here. It might not be a formation, possibly a treasure? Regardless, the chaotic forces on this peak were the weakest.

Without further ado, Su Yu led the group to circle the peak, exploring everywhere. They didn't know what he was searching for, but after a while, Su Yu found a small cave entrance in the middle of the peak. His eyes gleamed as he quickly examined it, then led the group inside.

Great Zhou King wanted to warn him of the danger, but before he could, everyone was stunned. The small cave entrance led to a vast hollow space, with faint signs of habitation. The first thing they saw was a giant pearl hanging from the cave ceiling, illuminating the dark cavern.

Someone had lived here!

Dingjun Marquis was also stunned, "Could this be where Marquis Anbei lived?"

He quickly looked around, soon appearing dazed, "It might really be where he lived!"

He pointed to a stone bookshelf at the front of the cave, dazed, "I think I see some of Marquis Anbei's rare ancient books. Back then, the Battle King said Marquis Anbei didn't like reading and was uncultured, destined to be eliminated... Marquis Anbei borrowed some books from Culture King and others to save face, then carried them around, even showing off a few times... Wherever he stayed, he'd take out these books. It became a habit... This... this should be where he lived!"

He was shocked. Su Yu had just arrived and found Marquis Anbei's residence! People were curious about how Marquis Anbei survived in the chaotic mountains for a century. The myriad races and humans had tried to find out, but many died, leading to abandonment of the search.

Yet Su Yu found it immediately! What was going on?

Su Yu didn't bother explaining. Marquis Anbei survived here thanks to the barrier forces around the peak. As for the source of this power, Su Yu hadn't discovered it yet. It was either a treasure or a formation, simple as that.

"Everyone, we'll live here for now! This place is our base. Here, revealing your path power isn't a big issue."

Su Yu gave a few instructions, curious himself, eager to explore. If it was a treasure, it would be incredible, capable of shielding against chaotic interference. Such a treasure wouldn't be ordinary.

Su Yu quickly made arrangements, planning to investigate the neighbors later. Better safe than sorry, even if this place seemed relatively safe, one had to be cautious of neighbors dropping by!

Chapter 722: A New Haven

A group of people quickly began cleaning the cave. It had been uninhabited for a long time and was rather dirty.

The Great Ming King didn't idle either. He swiftly moved to the entrance of the cave to set up a concealing formation.

Finally, in the Upper Realm, they had found a good place to settle down.

Chaos Mountain, living alongside ancient beasts.
