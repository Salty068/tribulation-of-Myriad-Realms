Chapter 828: A Restless Group (Subscription Requested)

Everyone had left, and the tasks were heavy.

Before Su Yu departed, they had to become rulers of laws. Those on the list who failed to do so would have to step aside. This was both a pressure and a motivation. Following Su Yu had brought them many benefits. In the early days, when Su Yu was not strong enough to control the overall situation, some people were lost in battles like those in Great Xia Prefecture and against the Abyssal Race. But later on, as Su Yu grew stronger, such incidents rarely occurred.

Even if someone self-destructed, Su Yu would find a way to help them restore their physical body. However, it seemed that Su Yu was no longer willing to give everyone another chance. He might not be sending them to their deaths, but if they couldn't keep up, they would have to make way for those who could. Some occupied the power of the dao, forcing others to tread unfamiliar paths. Some paths had many practitioners, but Su Yu's world was too small. If everyone walked the same path, even if they all became rulers of laws, it would be meaningless.

...

In the grand hall, everyone had left.

Su Yu leaned back in his chair, taking a small rest. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked at the newcomer, smiling, "Got something to say?"

In the hall, Xia Huyou grinned mischievously, cupping his hands, "Your Majesty, I'm only at the Sunmoon Realm, a bit too weak."

Su Yu chuckled.

"You should just stay in the rear. The strong are meant to fight to the death."

Xia Huyou grinned, "That's true, but... even in the rear, one needs strength! Without it, even if you're stationed at the rear, you have no standing!"

"Look, after Hundred Battle King returns, if I have no strength, I can't do anything if they want to act!"

"To put it bluntly, once the frontline is wiped out, won't the rear have to step up?"

Those words... were indeed harsh.

Su Yu was speechless, "Can't you say something nicer?"

Xia Huyou's grin widened, "I call it honest advice. Besides, Your Majesty, you should give the weak a chance too. The strong were once weak, right? You're targeting Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables now, but we Sunmoon cultivators, once we enter the dao, might just become rulers of laws in a day!"

Xia Huyou laughed, "As long as the dao is compatible, the understanding deep, and the character strong, it's not impossible to step into the realm of a ruler of laws in a day! Directly mastering a dao..."

"You?"

Su Yu laughed, "Your cleaning character could make you a ruler of laws in a day, then you could clean the myriad realms?"

"That's not impossible!"

Xia Huyou was delighted, it's not out of the question!

"Your Majesty, don't underestimate this character. Cleansing filth, sweeping the myriad realms in a day, isn't that immensely powerful?"

Su Yu nodded, smiling. Indeed, no character is weak. If a character truly becomes powerful, mastering the rules in a day isn't impossible.

However... it's nonsense.

It's too difficult!

If it were truly possible to master the rules in a day, the path of characters wouldn't have been so hard throughout history.

Nowadays, most rulers of laws still follow the martial path.

The path of characters, directly becoming strong through characters, is rare. The Great Zhou King counts as one, and Wan Tiansheng too, but not Lantian.

"You're here for benefits?"

Su Yu laughed. This guy was really straightforward.

Many wanted benefits, but others didn't dare to approach Su Yu. Xia Huyou, however, sneaked over, anxious despite being only at the Sunmoon Realm.

Xia Huyou grinned, "It's not just about benefits. There's something else I want to discuss with Your Majesty."

"Let's hear it."

After Su Yu spoke, Xia Huyou looked around sneakily. Su Yu watched his performance, thinking, what are you looking at? Do you think I have women hidden here?

Xia Huyou whispered, "Your Majesty, you're taking people upstream soon, right?"

"Yes."

"Doesn't that mean if we lose... it's over?"

"Pretty much!"

"Then there's no backup plan?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "What backup plan is there to leave now?"

What backup plan could there be!

There's no way to leave one!

Xia Huyou grinned, "There is, Your Majesty!"

Su Yu looked at him, surprised. A Sunmoon cultivator, and he had a backup plan?

Xia Huyou whispered, "Your Majesty, have you forgotten the yin-yang apertures?"

"Hmm?"

Su Yu looked at him, and Xia Huyou reminded, "The Bai family! Have you forgotten about Old Master Bai? Directly opening the yang aperture, absorbing death energy, strengthening the body, and instantly unleashing immense power... It's just that after Your Majesty opened the Heaven Gate, you didn't pay much attention to this!"

"But Your Majesty might not care, we do!"

Xia Huyou quickly said, "We've always been mindful of the yang aperture!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, looking at him. Xia Huyou continued, "Previously, the power of the physical path wasn't enough and was occupied by others. Now, with Hundred Battle King and others dead, part of the power has merged into Your Majesty's dao, and part has returned to the physical path!"

"And opening the yang aperture is the physical path!"

Xia Huyou quickly said, "Before, Your Majesty converted life and death, absorbing death energy to saturate the yang aperture. Now that Your Majesty has taken the Death Realm, if we convert now, we can quickly open the yang aperture, strengthen ourselves, and use the power of life and death to enhance the yang aperture!"

Su Yu looked at him, frowning slightly, not speaking.

Xia Huyou continued, "The physical path is actually a shortcut! This was one of the reasons the Human Race was strong before. Maybe the physical path can't grasp a complete power of laws, but what if we open the yang aperture and crazily absorb physical power?"

He looked at Su Yu, "Since Your Majesty took down Hundred Battle King and others, I've been thinking about whether to... cultivate a batch of such death warriors!"

His eyes flickered, "Even deliberately removing some people! For example, in this list of 30 people, I think Your Majesty could remove my great-grandfather! He and my father both cultivate the path of the blade, which actually conflicts. Now my father has to switch to a path similar to the blade, which still has differences..."

Su Yu's face changed, "You guys, each one of you, such filial sons and grandsons!"

How inhumane!

This guy was suggesting I deliberately remove the Great Xia King to make way for his father?

Is he even human?

Xia Huyou grinned, "My great-grandfather going is more dangerous. He doesn't have a stronger understanding of the blade than my father! And my great-grandfather, having commanded troops for years, could completely lead a team if removed!"

"Not only that, removing my great-grandfather could establish Your Majesty's authority! Let people see that even if my Xia family has always supported Your Majesty, it's still about ability, not face!"

Xia Huyou quickly said, "Otherwise, some people now think I'm a meritorious official and can rest on my laurels, which is unacceptable! Your Majesty, I think a deterrent is necessary!"

"Moreover, the yang aperture is indeed a means to quickly enhance people!"

Xia Huyou no longer smiled frivolously, speaking seriously, "Opening the yang aperture, strengthening the body, absorbing death energy... Even if one can't become a ruler of laws, they can possess some of the combat power of a ruler of laws! And the yang aperture... can be opened in advance, even if one's aptitude isn't enough!"

This was something Bai Feng's grandfather had tried.

It was indeed possible!

One didn't need to open 360 acupoints to open the yang aperture. It was just that previously, storing power was too troublesome, requiring countless time to absorb. But once a symbiosis with the undead was achieved, with unlimited death energy, it could be infused endlessly!

To strengthen the yang aperture!

The concept of the yang aperture was proposed by Su Yu himself.

Xia Huyou continued, "Including some Sunmoon, some Eternal, some Daofuse... They might not have the aptitude to open 360 acupoints, but they can open the yang aperture, making them stronger!"

"Your Majesty can completely leave a batch of these people, organize them, and have them all cultivate the physical path!"

Su Yu fell into deep thought.

The physical path!

Xia Huyou continued, "I heard... the Giant Race also follows the physical path? And I heard that the same path can be combined! Now, with the myriad races and realms, we are dominant. Your Majesty, the physical path isn't exclusive to the Human Race, right?"

"We can extract the power of the physical path from various races, can we extract it?"

"If we can... then it can be done!"

Xia Huyou looked at Su Yu. Su Yu had risen too high now, no longer caring much about these things. His focus was more on becoming a ruler of laws and advancing further in that realm.

But for Xia Huyou, the matter of the yang aperture wasn't long ago, and he remembered it clearly.

Su Yu tapped the back of his chair, and Xia Huyou added, "Your Majesty, the physical path doesn't require high comprehension! It's also a path that can be forcibly enhanced, and the yang aperture is an opportunity!"

Su Yu didn't speak, lost in thought.

Can it be enhanced?

There's hope!

By crazily infusing them with the power of the physical path, strengthening the body, then forcibly opening the yang aperture, and then absorbing death energy to fill it, or simply absorbing physical power to fill it.

Of course, pure physical power is too violent. Balancing it with death energy might be better.

In the myriad realms, the physical path isn't exclusive to the Human Race.

Before, it was difficult to manage.

Now, it's possible to find a way to extract the physical power from the myriad races!

Seeing Su Yu's interest, Xia Huyou added, "And, Your Majesty, have you forgotten how you rose to power?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "What do you mean?"

"Your Majesty, the Book of Time!"

Xia Huyou grinned, "Your Majesty, imitate the Book of Time! Borrow the dao! If you can't seize it, then borrow it! Create a counterfeit version of the Book of Time, infuse it with the power of myriad daos, and use the blood essence of myriad races to explode instantly!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Without enough strength, forcibly borrowing power will kill people!"

"Death warriors, huh!"

Xia Huyou's eyes were filled with emotion. "I know you have a sharp tongue but a soft heart. You've never really thought about these things! You always believe you can shoulder the world alone, but you're wrong. Even the Human Emperor had secret guards like the Great Zhou King. And you?"

He looked at Su Yu. "Have you ever left yourself a way out?"

Su Yu fell silent.

Did he have one?

He had hidden his father and the others away. Did that count as a way out?

Xia Huyou continued, "As an emperor, you need to leave yourself some kind of backup. My Xia family is willing to become the secret guards of Emperor Yu, just like the Human Emperor's secret guards!"

"We are willing to train a group of secret guards who are unafraid of death, ready to die, and willing to sacrifice themselves at critical moments for Your Majesty!"

Xia Huyou became serious. "I said it before, the blade of my Xia family is willing to fight for Your Majesty! Now, as Your Majesty rises higher and higher, the composition of the Luminous Domain Mansion is too complex. If Your Majesty were to die... the mansion would instantly fall apart!"

"Even if you don't die... if you, like the Human Emperor, leave the Myriad Realms for decades and can't return... it might still collapse!"

Su Yu's foundation was too shallow!

Xia Huyou said gravely, "Your Majesty is also from the Great Xia Prefecture. You should know, our prefecture may lack in other areas, but we have courage! The military and civilians of the Great Xia Prefecture are not afraid to die. Your Majesty is also our pride! So today, I see this vast Luminous Domain Mansion... and Your Majesty doesn't even have guards!"

Su Yu smiled. "I do have them..."

"Are you referring to Lantian, Your Majesty?" Xia Huyou chuckled. "That's not enough! Are you talking about those soldiers? They're too weak! As the emperor of the Human Race, the emperor of the Luminous Domain Mansion, Your Majesty has too few people who can be used in secret!"

"To put it bluntly... you can't even entrust your legacy! Would you leave it to Wan Tiansheng and the others? They're all out in the open! It wouldn't work! Back then, no one knew about the Torchbearers until the Human Emperor had an accident!"

Su Yu pondered for a long time before saying, "If I die, I don't need these..."

"What if you don't die?" Xia Huyou countered. "What if you're trapped like the Human Emperor? If Wan Tiansheng and the others are also trapped, who will think of a way to save you? And who would have the ability to do so?"

Su Yu looked at him. "Would you save me?"

"Of course!"

Xia Huyou said earnestly, "Your Majesty, you need a hidden blade! All your cards are on the table! Right now, you have no cards left!"

Su Yu looked at him for a while before asking, "Is this your own idea?"

Xia Huyou was a smart person, Su Yu knew that well.

This man was one of the rare, highly capable second-generation martial artists Su Yu had met. He could be humble, shameless, and take on great responsibilities at critical moments.

Don't be fooled by the fact that many people live long lives today, but those are just wasted years.

Sometimes, age doesn't mean anything. Every era has its elites, and Xia Huyou was clearly one of them.

Back in the day, when Su Yu was just the son of an ordinary soldier, Xia Huyou dared to invest in him, running around like a grandson. That alone was something not everyone could do.

However, Su Yu felt that such a big decision might not be just his idea.

Was he worried that Su Yu would lose the battle upstream?

Xia Huyou grinned. "Sort of, but... it's also the idea of my second granduncle and Fatty Zhu!"

"Zhu Tiandao?"

"Yes!"

"You call him Fatty Zhu?"

"Ahem... we're close!"

Xia Huyou said sheepishly. If he didn't call him Fatty Zhu, his second granduncle would beat him to death. It was a habit.

I see, so those two are involved as well.

Su Yu fell into thought, and after a moment, he said, "Their idea is for me to leave some backup, like your so-called death warriors?"

"Yes!"

Xia Huyou nodded. "Right now, Your Majesty has thrown all your cards on the table for the Human Race. You almost have no cards left! And when will Your Majesty's world be strong enough to rival all sides?"

"More people, even if they can't decide the outcome of top-level battles, can handle smaller situations for Your Majesty!"

Su Yu thought for a moment, the Yang Aperture...

Forcing open the Yang Aperture, making everyone absorb death energy and physical Dao power, Su Yu suddenly said, "In that case, the future might be limited..."

Xia Huyou sighed. "Your Majesty, let me be blunt... do you think those ancient kings who became kings through physical cultivation had much future? If they didn't change their path, how much future did they have? Do you think these people... chose this path willingly? Maybe they were death warriors from the start!"

"The future? Does Your Majesty still have the mind to consider the future of death warriors?"

"The Human Emperor might seem righteous and kind to Your Majesty... but he is an emperor, a qualified emperor. Even if he left, he ensured that after multiple defeats, the Human Race still passed down for a hundred thousand years. What about Your Majesty?"

Xia Huyou grinned. "If Your Majesty disappears, even without foreign invasion, forget a hundred thousand years, even a hundred years... I'm overestimating Your Majesty!"

Can you outplay the Human Emperor?      Don't kid yourself!

Look at his methods, the Torchbearers hidden in the shadows, always supporting the Human Lord to rise. Each time they rise, they bring the Human Race back to prominence. The torch never extinguishes. If not for the incompetence of later generations, the Human Emperor's move could have birthed dozens of rulers of laws in the Myriad Realms!

Even so, didn't it lead to you, Su Yu?

If you, Su Yu, leave, then truly... there's nothing left!

Xia Huyou added, "It's not that we don't trust Your Majesty, but it's always good to make some preparations!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered slightly. "Then who do you plan to select for your so-called secret guards?"

"Secret guards aren't just brutes; there need to be thinkers, people with other skills, to ensure the legacy doesn't die out!"

Xia Huyou quickly said, "Nowadays, rulers of laws dominate, and no one cares about the weak! They can't make it to the stage! My idea is to select a batch from the Daofuse Realm, a batch from the Eternal Realm, a batch from the Sunmoon Realm, and then select some good seedlings... and train them in secret!"

"Right now, Your Majesty has a unique advantage, dominating the Myriad Realms!"

"One could say, no era has been better than Your Majesty's!"

After speaking, Xia Huyou paused, grinning. "If the strength is sufficient... send a batch into the Gate of Hell to scout for Your Majesty, and also to fight, lest they lack combat power!"

"We need more people, survival of the fittest. Out of ten thousand, one will emerge. Out of a million, a hundred usable ones will appear!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Is this your selection method?"

"Yes!"

Xia Huyou nodded. "Your Majesty doesn't need to worry about these things, just give them some encouragement from time to time, and that's enough! As for loyalty, we can handle that!"

Su Yu stroked his chin. "Actually, I think it might not be very useful. If I win, it might only take a few years. If I lose, they won't have time to become a decisive force!"

"Everything is uncertain!"

Xia Huyou chuckled. "Your Majesty, some people have grown to this level, and it didn't take long. This era is different!"

"If we can train a batch with the combat power of rulers of laws, even if they're only fifth-class, one or two might not matter, but what about ten or a hundred? Ten or a hundred, Your Majesty can't match that, right?"

Su Yu sneered. "In my world, I'd kill them all!"

Of course, if encountered outside, that would be troublesome.

In his world, he could suppress them, but outside, he couldn't. With so many, Su Yu would also be killed.

However, he was slightly intrigued.

Xia Huyou added, "If they all convert to half-dead spirits, they can even be thrown into the Death Realm for training. Now that the strong races of the Myriad Races have withdrawn, there are no good opponents to fight, but there are still plenty of dead spirits in the Celestial River of Death, perfect for training troops!"

At this moment, Su Yu nodded. "Perhaps... it's a fallback!"

Xia Huyou chuckled. "A fallback? Your Majesty, don't underestimate the power of death warriors. If they develop quickly, they can soon become a formidable force, capable of saving lives at critical moments!"

"Moreover, everyone has abandoned their future now... but if Your Majesty succeeds in opening the heavens, just give everyone a bit of hope. If they survive to the end, give us a chance to merge into the world... everything can start anew!"

Xia Huyou smiled. "Your Majesty's advantage is something even the Human Emperor can't compare to. The Human Emperor's world is incomplete, just beginning, but Your Majesty's world is already somewhat complete!"

In such a situation, Su Yu could offer everyone greater hope.

Give the secret guards hope, even if I've cut off my retreat now, it doesn't matter at all!

Su Yu nodded. "Who do you think you need to help you?"

"Dingjun!"

Xia Huyou first mentioned Marquis Dingjun, Su Yu's eyes flickered slightly, but Xia Huyou continued, "Empyrean Cloud, Grandstar, Liu Hong, my great-grandfather... actually, it's best to include Lantian!"

He calculated for a moment, then added, "Also my second granduncle, Fatty Zhu, the Heavenly Casting King..."

"Who?"

"The Heavenly Casting King, we need a strong caster to forge weapons for us, preferably to forge a large number of Book of Time replicas, ones that can unleash the power of a ruler of laws as long as there's enough blood essence!"

Su Yu inhaled sharply. Your ambition... is indeed not small!

Casters, fighters, thinkers, intelligence gatherers, schemers, logistics managers...

Xia Huyou continued, "We, these people, will give up all future prospects. After a great victory, Your Majesty can reward us according to merit! Before that, we can sacrifice everything, including lifespan and future, for one goal: to become stronger! Infinitely stronger!"

"After Your Majesty leaves, we will help monitor the Myriad Realms, keep an eye on the Gate of Hell, and any other potential portals!"

As he spoke, Xia Huyou added, "By the way... did Your Majesty use a special method on Marquis Dragonblood to make him stronger quickly?"

Su Yu nodded. "My book pages..."

"I knew it!"

Xia Huyou chuckled, "Your Majesty, why not share a bit with us?"

Su Yu frowned, "This thing... it's completely a pseudo-dao, devoid of any true Dao essence. Everything you perceive is actually false..."

"But the power is real!" Xia Huyou laughed gleefully. "If I remember correctly, I've heard that Marquis Dragonblood reached the level of a ruler of laws in no time."

"Pseudo, not a true ruler of laws."

"That's good enough!" Xia Huyou exclaimed excitedly. "Your Majesty has many methods. Why worry about the future? We don't even know when we'll die, so why care about the future? As long as we can increase our strength, who cares about that?"

"Your Majesty, many Daos among the myriad races are currently unclaimed. If Your Majesty can implant book pages into them... I know you might not want to slaughter people, but we don't mind!"

"We can go and kill some people, strengthen the Daos, and rapidly grow stronger!"

"We can even find ways to invade the Death Path, become half-dead spirits, or even full dead spirits, it doesn't matter!"

This guy spoke lightly, but Su Yu felt a bit emotional. "You're more ruthless than I am when you get serious."

"Not really... Your Majesty and we might have different philosophies! To be honest, we don't care how many people we sacrifice to achieve our goals!"

Su Yu laughed, "You guys... you just can't stand being obsolete, can't stand the loneliness, right?"

"Exactly!" Xia Huyou grinned, "Your Majesty, this era belongs to us, but now? It's all old relics, with only Your Majesty standing out. Isn't that lonely? Of course, we can't accept it! We are the protagonists of this era. Now, it seems Your Majesty intends to lead the old relics into battle while we fade into the background. Do you think we're content with that?"

"The humans born in the Tenth Tide grew up fighting, with no one to rely on. The Great Xia Prefecture has been at war year after year. Does Your Majesty really think we're afraid of death?"

He shook his head, "We're not afraid of death... we're actually afraid of peace!"

Su Yu's eyes narrowed.

"Yes, afraid of peace. We talk about peace, but if you really let us put away our weapons and retire, we're not old. The truly old ones are those relics!"

He laughed, "Your Majesty, would you like to take a walk with me?"

Su Yu looked at him and nodded.

Xia Huyou mentioned a place, and soon, Su Yu took him and vanished from the Luminous Domain Mansion.

...

Great Xia Cultural Research Academy.

When Su Yu appeared, the small academy was bustling with people. Of course, these people used to be big figures, but now... not so much.

Including Zhu Tiandao and others!

A group of Eternal Realm beings, not even at the Daofuse level.

Seeing Su Yu appear, Lord Xia Hou chuckled, "I told you, my grandson has a way with words. Your Majesty still came!"

Zhu Tiandao also laughed, "Your Majesty, the Xia family's chubby kid has said everything that needs to be said. Our intentions are straightforward! In this era, we don't want to give up, so we're willing to abandon everything—future, lifespan, whether the Dao fits or not... none of that matters! We want to become powerful... to be the rulers of this era, not to be ruled by others!"

"The Great Zhou King and the others are old, and yes, they're strong too, but we can't compete with them right now!"

Zhu Tiandao laughed, "If Your Majesty has a way to help us progress quickly, even if it's just for three to five years, that's not a problem!"

At this moment, Su Yu glanced around and saw many familiar faces!

Yun Chen, Nan Wujiang, even Qin Zhen and others were here.

Their strength wasn't impressive; some were Eternal, some barely at the Daofuse level, and some were still at the Sunmoon Realm. Here, he even saw Qin Fang, Huang Teng, and other former geniuses.

Even... there were people from the Great Zhou Prefecture, like Dan Xiong!

Even Liu Hong, that sly fellow, was standing not far away with a smile.

Seeing Su Yu look over, Liu Hong grinned, "Your Majesty, I think if you give us a chance, we can stir up a storm! Your Majesty's current subordinates are all relics; this New Era doesn't live up to its name!"

Su Yu laughed, "You sly guy, are you content being a shadow guard?"

Liu Hong chuckled, "The Great Zhou King isn't honest either, and he's the head of the shadow guards! If you're too honest, how can you make the shadow guards even darker, right?"

Su Yu truly laughed!

That made sense.

Whether it's death warriors or shadow guards, it's not just about having strong power; you also need to use your brain, the kind of cunning brain!

Otherwise, the Great Zhou King would have been wiped out by Hundred Battle long ago!

How else could he have led the Tenth Tide?

Su Yu laughed and then became more solemn, "If you truly don't care about anything, to be honest, there are quite a few ways to improve!"

Su Yu's eyes narrowed, "First, change your bloodline and integrate with the Daos of other races. Once I eliminate the ruler of laws, there's hope to replace them! Second, create replicas of the Book of Time to temporarily unleash great power! Third, walk the Chaos Path. The Chaos Path is slow because they don't deeply analyze chaos, but as the opener of the heavens, I have a much deeper understanding than others!"

"Fourth, invade the unclaimed Daos of various races! Fifth, I can create some civilization pages, integrate them into you, and you can act like Marquis Dragonblood, completely as puppets! Sixth..."

"Go on!"

Everyone was listening with interest, and when Su Yu suddenly stopped, they became anxious. They didn't know Su Yu had so many methods.

Su Yu squinted, "Sixth... it's actually simpler, but I'm afraid you won't accept it."

"Just say it!"

"Become the God Devourer Race!"

Everyone was stunned, and Su Yu squinted, "Nowadays, many people overlook Doubao and their essence, but their essence is the spirit of the Dao! I can actually kill you all... cough, abandon your physical bodies, attach your spirits to the Dao, and forcibly merge. At that point, the Dao is you, and you are the Dao... of course, there's a big downside!"

"Back then, my teacher, Bai Feng, actually mentioned wanting to take this path, but I rejected it. Abandoning the physical body and directly becoming the spirit of the Dao... are you still considered human? Are you still part of the human race? Doubao and Flatbread were accidents... but I intentionally created such beings."

Everyone's eyes flickered, and Xia Huyou quickly asked, "In that case, would we become rulers of laws quickly?"

"Quickly!"

Su Yu nodded, "Doubao and Flatbread were spirits formed after death, not intentionally created! So, they have no memory, no anything! They cultivate and comprehend in ignorance, not even knowing what their Dao is!"

"But I can find a way to preserve everyone's memory, directly integrate into the Dao, and keep the memory intact. Everyone will know what Dao they're merging with and can quickly master it because the Dao itself is full of insights..."

Su Yu continued, "But there are difficulties. First, it's easy to be assimilated by the Dao and completely become a part of it! Second, it's easy to die completely, with no chance of rescue!"

Everyone looked at each other, and Zhu Tiandao couldn't help but ask, "You had so many methods, why didn't you mention them before?"

"They're all methods that cut off future generations!"

Su Yu shook his head, "Although I like using some insidious tricks, to say that I would turn my own people into something neither human nor ghost, that's not what I want to see! However, seeing you all, you seem unwilling to be lonely! Since it's come to this, and you don't care about anything, wouldn't it be too pretentious for me to keep hiding?"

Su Yu smiled, "If you're willing, all sorts of methods can be used. I can guarantee that soon, everyone can become strong! Daofuse, Heavenly King, ruler of laws... it won't take long!"

Su Yu licked his lips, "I suspect that the Culture King might have thought about this too, but didn't do it. The God Devourer Race, I suspect, was created by him... As for Doubao, I once suspected it might be a ruler of laws from the Immortal Race! Later, it was killed by the Culture King, and he conveniently created it. Otherwise, Doubao wouldn't keep staring at Tiangu... maybe it was one of the masters of the Longevity Dao and the Immortal Emperor Dao?"

Who cares!

Su Yu didn't pay much attention to this. Doubao, in this case, was dead, and the spirit born after death had little to do with its past life.

The master of the Immortal Emperor Dao is still around, the current Immortal Emperor, seemingly not dead. Doubao might have been the master of a similar Dao, born after the master of the Longevity Dao died. Su Yu remembered that the Culture King had killed such a strong Immortal Race member, suppressed the Immortal Race, broke several Daos, and even created Longevity Pills.

Perhaps this is the root of the enmity between Doubao and Tiangu, merely the attraction between Daos.

These methods are all desperate measures.

Once you do it, there's almost no chance to do it again, unlike others who can improve through orthodox methods, with great future potential. They can even find ways to leave Su Yu's world and return to the River of Time.

Su Yu said, this is equivalent to creating puppets, that's the idea.

Treating people as tools, that's it!

As the opener of the heavens, he has no shortage of methods. In the current myriad realms, Su Yu might be the only true opener of the heavens. The Human Emperor doesn't count; he just started it, and the Human Emperor didn't even have time to understand it.

Lord Xia Hou was grinning from ear to ear, "Your Majesty should have said so earlier. Why not do such a good thing? What non-human methods, what's the big deal? I just ask Your Majesty, if Your Majesty ultimately succeeds in opening the heavens and reaches the level of the Master of Time, will we still have hope?"

"Yes!"

"Then that's settled!"

Chapter 847: The Ambitions of the Tenth Tide

Xiahou Ye chuckled, "Then let's do it! This is much better than we expected. According to His Majesty, perhaps it won't be long before you all head upstream, and with no one paying attention to us, we might produce even more rulers of laws!"

"By then, even if His Majesty is defeated, we can retreat... Ha, imagine dozens or even hundreds of rulers of laws emerging at once, regardless of their rank—it would terrify our opponents!"

Liu Hong also laughed, "Your Majesty, switching paths might be difficult for me, but I do need some assistance with mastering the Ink Dao."

"Speak!"

Liu Hong suddenly grinned slyly, "Your Majesty, could you slightly... shift my Ink Dao? How about moving it to the junction of the River of Time and the Death Path? I'll transform the Ink Dao into the Path of Life and Death, benefiting from both ends! Right now, it's hard for me to manage!"

Su Yu couldn't help but laugh in exasperation, "Do you think shifting a Dao is that simple?"

"You can do it, Your Majesty!"

Liu Hong chuckled, "Your Majesty, last time, that undead ruler was indeed troublesome, but as long as you don't resurrect the dead, I'm not a spirit, and I don't need resurrection. It's just a matter of shifting a Dao. Back when the Culture King secretly opened the Ink Dao, he might not have been as powerful as you are now!"

Su Yu was speechless. Go to hell with that idea! This isn't simple at all! This guy, always scheming, never a good person.

Zhu Tiandao also chimed in, "Your Majesty, give it a try! If we all succeed... we'll become a formidable force! Your methods surpass those of many strong individuals. The techniques of a world-opener must be extraordinary!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment and nodded, "Let's give it a shot! While everyone is cultivating these days, strive to become rulers of laws. I'll take you through the River of Time, and you can choose whichever path you fancy!"

"If the master of the River of Time doesn't return, no one can restrict me. But I must warn you, if he does return... you're all done for, and none of you will escape!"

Everyone was indifferent. Of course, if he returns, we'd be blown away in a single breath. We don't need you to tell us that!

Seeing that no one objected, Su Yu was resigned. These lunatics! Su Yu thought they would give up or quietly cultivate, waiting for an opportunity. But no, they were all unwilling to settle!

They didn't care about anything else; they just wanted to shine in this era!

Indeed, the Tenth Tide had no normal people!

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly felt that perhaps he was the only normal one. These guys were all a bit off.

Shouldn't normal people be waiting patiently for the strong to decide the outcome of the battle?

Meanwhile, throughout the Cultural Research Academy, strange laughter echoed continuously—"Heh heh," "Jie jie," "Ha ha."

Lying low? Waiting? What's that? We are the masters of the Tenth Tide, and we refuse to be content!

Su Yu spoke eloquently about this being a new era, yet most of his subordinates were old-timers. Only a few newcomers like Wan Tiansheng and Lantian were not the main core, which didn't align with the characteristics of the New Yu Era!

Thus, this restless group sought out Su Yu, eager to turn the tables and take charge.

And Su Yu? He didn't care anymore. If they were willing, he wouldn't stop them!
