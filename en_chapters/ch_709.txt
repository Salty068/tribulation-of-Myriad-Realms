Chapter 709: Preparing for Battle

"Emperor Yu, aren't you going to hide?"

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun was somewhat surprised. Wasn't Su Yu going to conceal himself?

Su Yu glanced at him and smiled, "Why should I hide? Doesn't he know you've been taken away? Trying to cover up?"

"…"

That made a lot of sense.

Marquis Dingjun had nothing to say, and Su Yu calmly added, "Just don't introduce me."

"Understood."

Marquis Dingjun nodded.

Meanwhile, Su Yu continued to toy with a wisp of faint gray power at his fingertips, his brow slightly furrowed, his face still somewhat pale as he pondered.

He had managed to replicate the power of chaos.

However, it wasn't stable, and its potency seemed weaker than the existing chaotic power. This wasn't right. Normally, extracting chaotic power from the power of myriad paths should make it stronger!

How could the refined chaotic power be weaker than the original?

"There are still some components I haven't analyzed."

Su Yu had a hunch that there were some forces that neither he nor Lantian had fully understood.

At this moment, Su Yu concealed the power of the Great Dao, merely converting some chaotic power.

It wasn't through his own means but through the Mark of Civilization.

By converting his own power into chaotic power through the "Yu" character, Su Yu originally possessed the power of a second-tier Daofuse.

Yet now, after conversion, not only did he not become stronger, but he weakened somewhat. Su Yu estimated that at full strength, he could only muster the power of a third-tier Daofuse with chaotic power.

How could this be? The more he mixed, the weaker he became.

This indicated a problem in the conversion process.

"The power hasn't been fully converted, and the virtual Great Dao hasn't been successfully outlined. This means my understanding of the chaotic path is still lacking. Right now, I'm merely matching components rather than truly comprehending the path."

This resulted in significant power loss during the process.

Third-tier Daofuse power was just passable.

Roughly equivalent to Marquis Dingjun's strength.

Marquis Dingjun, seeing his nonchalance, was a bit worried and transmitted, "Emperor Yu, could it be that Shadow Marquis hasn't come because you're here, and he's... afraid to come?"

Su Yu looked up at him, pausing before saying, "If he's in a hurry, he'll come despite the danger. If not, then we'll wait."

Doesn't he know you've been taken away?

Of course, he does!

So what's there to be afraid of?

He looked at Marquis Dingjun, frowning slightly, "You seem very reluctant to have me by your side."

Marquis Dingjun smiled wryly, not really... well, maybe a little.

Having lived for so many years, having experienced glory and downfall, having met the Human Emperor and fought against the myriad races, he shouldn't have much to fear from a newcomer like Su Yu. At worst, it was just a life.

But honestly, facing Su Yu, it wasn't fear, just that Su Yu gave him a feeling of discomfort, making it hard to speak freely.

At this moment, he couldn't help but compare Su Yu to the Hundred Battle King. Being around the Hundred Battle King was much more comfortable.

In the last tide, when he was alone with the Hundred Battle King, he never felt this kind of discomfort.

Marquis Dingjun sighed inwardly. Well, it seems like birds of a feather flock together.

He saw how the Great Zhou King and others got along well with Su Yu.

Indeed, just being able to fight isn't enough for a future.

As he was thinking, Marquis Dingjun's eyes moved. At this moment, in the wilderness beyond their location, a black figure slowly emerged.

In the distance, it was Shadow Marquis.

At this time, Shadow Marquis also saw Marquis Dingjun.

Likewise, he saw the white-haired youth beside Marquis Dingjun.

"Is this the person who took Marquis Dingjun?"

"Seems like a human..."

"His real age should be young, but... he seems injured, with much of his lifespan consumed."

"As for strength... Eternal or Daofuse?"

Shadow Marquis walked slowly from a distance, silently observing.

He kept speculating about Su Yu's identity.

This person, he hadn't seen before and wasn't familiar with.

But he might hold a high position, standing beside Marquis Dingjun. Yet, Marquis Dingjun seemed somewhat uneasy, frequently glancing at the young man's reactions despite standing parallel.

Marquis Dingjun, after all, was one of the few remaining ancient marquises of the human race. What kind of person could make him feel apprehensive and uneasy?

Shadow Marquis kept pondering, his willpower invisibly probing the surroundings, finding nothing, sensing no one. But he knew there were strong individuals around.

A kind of intuition honed through years of surviving danger.

There were strong individuals watching him in the dark!

Possibly more than one.

Marquis Dingjun didn't seem injured, nor did he appear sealed. Either Marquis Dingjun had reached some agreement with these people, or he had joined them.

In an instant, Shadow Marquis analyzed a lot.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was also observing him.

After watching for a while from a distance, he turned to Marquis Dingjun and asked, "Is he cultivating the Shadow Path?"

"No."

Marquis Dingjun explained through transmission, "It's the Path of Darkness."

Su Yu nodded thoughtfully.

There were many similar paths, the Path of Darkness, the Path of Shadows, the Path of Concealment...

All could fit this person.

Without engaging in combat, it was hard to determine the specific power of the Great Dao.

This person approached silently, revealing his figure, likely intentionally. His stealth abilities should not be weak. No wonder Shadow Marquis could survive alone in the Upper Realm for years, always gathering intelligence.

"He's a useful guy, more useful than you."

Su Yu spoke bluntly, leaving Marquis Dingjun speechless.

What a thing to say!

"Was his status higher than yours in ancient times?"

Su Yu asked, and Marquis Dingjun, helpless, transmitted, "About the same. Shadow Marquis was in charge of intelligence in ancient times, not part of our system."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Moments later, at a distance of about a kilometer, Shadow Marquis stopped, his face obscured by a cloak, and said softly, "Marquis Dingjun, won't you introduce me?"

Marquis Dingjun hesitated for a moment, and Su Yu chuckled, "Nameless."

"…"

A rather dismissive title, but Shadow Marquis didn't press further. He quickly said, "Marquis Dingjun, I came to tell you something you might not know. Just yesterday, the Demon Race's council envoy visited various Dao Fields, widely inviting myriad races' Daofuse to encircle and kill Marquis Huoyun at Divine Fire Mountain."

Marquis Dingjun was shocked, quickly asking, "Kill Marquis Huoyun?"

"Yes."

Shadow Marquis, still observing Su Yu, calmly said, "Now, all Dao Fields have Dao Masters responding. In nine days, they will gather at Divine Fire Mountain! Marquis Huoyun is in danger. Marquis Dingjun, I came to ask your opinion. Should we rescue him, or what? Marquis Huoyun is likely already surrounded and unable to escape."

Marquis Dingjun's face turned grave, and he said, "Rescue? Since it's already widely known, this... is probably a trap, right?"

He sighed, not really being foolish.

Making such a big fuss, widely inviting strong individuals, was clearly a bait.

In the past, when the myriad races wanted to kill humans, they would quietly find the target's location, strike with thunderous force, and instantly kill the target to prevent any long delays.

When Marquis Minshan was killed, they didn't even know about it.

It wasn't until the commotion grew, and the myriad races released some information, that they learned Marquis Minshan had been slain.

If the commotion were smaller, they might have taken the opportunity to stir up some trouble.

Shadow Marquis softly said, "I know, the myriad races openly want to encircle and kill Marquis Huoyun this time, possibly related to you."

Marquis Dingjun's face changed slightly, instinctively looking at Su Yu.

He understood too.

They were targeting Su Yu's group!

Since they rescued Marquis Dingjun, now Marquis Huoyun was in danger. Would they rescue him?

Rescue, and it would be dangerous.

Don't rescue, and Marquis Huoyun would be killed first. As for Su Yu's mysterious group, the myriad races would have a general assessment of their strength, realm, and power.

Su Yu remained silent.

Marquis Dingjun gritted his teeth and said solemnly, "We can't rescue him! The myriad races must have laid a trap at Divine Fire Mountain. If we go to rescue, we'll surely die! We have no idea how many Daofuse the myriad races have sent, how many top-tier Daofuse there are!"

"Rushing in blindly, and all hope is lost!"

He looked at Shadow Marquis, taking a deep breath, "Not only can I not go, but you can't go either! No one else can! The myriad races might also want to take this opportunity to wipe us all out, especially you. The myriad races know of your existence. You've been active in various Dao Fields in the Upper Realm..."

Shadow Marquis softly said, "Then we can only watch Marquis Huoyun die."

Marquis Dingjun said painfully, "There's no other way, and you must inform Yunshui and Yingwu not to rescue either! Our strength is too weak. The myriad races might have dispatched dozens of Daofuse this time... how can we match that?"

Even though Su Yu's side had quite a few Daofuse, Marquis Dingjun didn't dare suggest Su Yu go for the rescue.

If they couldn't match, it would be over.

If Su Yu's group fell, then there would truly be no hope left.

Emotionally, he wanted to rescue, but realistically, they couldn't.

Marquis Dingjun had survived in the Upper Realm until now, and at critical moments, he could still make decisions.

At this moment, Su Yu smiled and asked, "Does Shadow Marquis know how many Daofuse have gone to Divine Fire Mountain?"

Shadow Marquis had been waiting for Su Yu to speak.

Now, his eyes moved slightly, and he slowly said, "I don't know the specifics. I only know that the one leading this encirclement is the Demon Race's council, with Marquis Blood Severance in charge! The Demon Race previously had three council leaders and 18 council members, totaling 21 Daofuse!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "21?"

That's quite a lot!

Because according to some, there were only seventy or eighty Daofuse in the Upper Realm. If the Demon Race alone had 21, then the three races would have over 60. What about the other races?

Shadow Marquis spoke in a deep voice, "Yes, 21 of them! Over the past 6,000 years, the Human Race has declined while the myriad races have developed rapidly. Marquis Dingjun and the others have been in hiding, knowing little, but I have been walking this land and know much more."

"As for the Demon Race, Marquis Modang has fallen. Previously, at Bright Moon Flower Valley, two more died. In recent days, three Daofuse Realm experts have perished. Currently, there are 3 council leaders and 15 council members."

Shadow Marquis continued, "This time, the Demon Race is deploying no fewer than 5 Daofuse Realm experts, and other races will provide some support. The Immortals and Gods will send at least 3 Daofuse Realm experts, making the total from the three races exceed 10!"

"Additionally, the Dragon, Nether, and Phoenix races will each send Daofuse Realm experts, totaling over 20!"

He looked at Su Yu, "Blood Severing Marquis is at the quasi-king level, so the Immortals and Gods might also send a quasi-king to assist. Ultimately, there should be three quasi-kings leading, with about 20 Daofuse Realm experts!"

Three Heavenly King-level experts and around 20 Daofuse Realm experts.

Marquis Dingjun's face turned pale as he listened. He knew that Su Yu's side wasn't weak. They had one Heavenly King-level expert, which was Lantian. But that was it!

The Great Zhou King was still some distance from being a Heavenly King, and so was Su Yu himself. Including Shadow Marquis, they had a total of only 8 Daofuse Realm experts. Adding Marquis Huoyun, they had just 9.

The gap was too large!

The opponent's numbers were more than double those of the Human Race. And this wasn't even all of them. If they couldn't quickly take down Su Yu and his group, reinforcements would soon arrive, with strong experts from all sides ready to be mobilized.

A direct confrontation was unwinnable!

Marquis Dingjun looked desperate and quickly said, "We can't save them, Shadow. It's not that we don't want to; we simply can't! You know the current situation of the Human Race. Facing them head-on will only lead to our complete annihilation!"

Shadow Marquis said nothing, instead looking at Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled, "Why are you looking at me? Three quasi-kings and twenty Daofuse Realm experts—I'm not the master of rules, and I can't do anything about it."

He truly couldn't do anything!

If he could handle three Heavenly Kings and 20 Daofuse Realm experts, he would have wiped them out after a few attempts. Why would he need to sneak around?

Shadow Marquis sighed softly, "Nameless friend, is there nothing you can do?"

Su Yu shook his head, "There's nothing I can do. This is clearly a suicide mission, and I don't want to die."

"Indeed."

Shadow Marquis sighed and said, "Nameless friend... are you from the Human Race?"

"Yes."

Su Yu smiled, "You've asked me a question, and I have something I'd like to ask you."

"Feel free to ask."

"How did Marquis Minshan die?"

Su Yu asked, and Shadow Marquis replied softly, "The Immortal Race discovered his whereabouts and coordinated with several quasi-king experts to ambush his hiding place, killing Marquis Minshan."

"Are there many quasi-kings in the Immortal Race?"

"Like the Demon Race, they have three on the surface."

Shadow Marquis continued softly, "The Immortal, Demon, and God races are similar in strength. Marquis Minshan was also at the quasi-king level, but he was besieged by four or five quasi-kings and ultimately fell..."

Shadow Marquis lamented, "If he hadn't died, the myriad races would still have some fear of us. A quasi-king expert launching surprise attacks on various races would make them cautious."

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling, "If I were to lead people to attack various Dao arenas, would the siege on Divine Fire Mountain continue?"

Shadow Marquis replied softly, "Attacking Dao arenas? It's not the first time such a thing has happened. The Human Race has done it before. But as you heard, the Demon Race is deploying 5 Daofuse Realm experts, and the remaining dozen are in the Demon Race's domain! Daofuse Realm experts can arrive in an instant. Once they converge, with a quasi-king council leader present, an attack would only lead to self-destruction!"

Su Yu nodded, "So there's no way at all?"

Shadow Marquis said bitterly, "My idea is to lurk near Divine Fire Mountain. If Marquis Huoyun is lucky, he might use the dangerous terrain of Divine Fire Mountain to escape the myriad races. If he succeeds, we can support him from the perimeter!"

This was a gamble on luck!

For Marquis Huoyun to escape from a siege of over 20 Daofuse Realm experts would require extraordinary luck.

Su Yu thought for a moment and asked, "Is there any place that the myriad races value so much that an attack would force Blood Severing Marquis and others to retreat, even abandoning the pursuit of Marquis Huoyun?"

Is there such a place?

Shadow Marquis's eyes flickered. After a long pause, he said in a low voice, "There is, but it's extremely dangerous!"

Upon hearing this, Marquis Dingjun's face changed, and he shouted, "No!"

He dared to come to Chaos Mountain, but now he was stopping Shadow Marquis from speaking. Marquis Dingjun was a bit angry and said in a deep voice, "Shadow, Nameless friend is from the Human Race and our hope! Don't deliberately lead him astray!"

Shadow Marquis calmly said, "I'm not leading him astray, Dingjun. You're overthinking it."

Marquis Dingjun was angry, seeing Su Yu looking at him, and said in a deep voice, "He's talking about the Land of Dao Source!"

Marquis Dingjun explained, "It's a place where unclaimed rules and Great Daos overflow! It's a critical area guarded by the myriad races! In the past, it was controlled by the Human Race! There, unclaimed rules and Great Daos often overflow, and the myriad races compete for them, heavily guarding the area! Many quasi-kings gather there, and if any race has hidden strength, it's likely there! Some old fellows have been in seclusion there for years without appearing!"

"Since the Human Race's defeat 6,000 years ago, we've completely lost control of that place."

Su Yu nodded slightly.

He had a general idea of what that place was.

The breach in the River of Time!

Yes, it must be.

That place must have been where the Human Emperor intended to start opening the Dao, similar to the intersection of life and death. Liu Hong's current location, except the Upper Realm doesn't have a Death Dao like that.

So, a hole was dug in the River of Time, and a large amount of the power of laws must have overflowed.

This was likely the origin of the so-called unclaimed rules and Great Daos.

Su Yu had been speculating that the Upper Realm had such a place, but he didn't know where it was. Now, hearing them talk, Su Yu understood—it was the Land of Dao Source.

Su Yu was still curious, pondering whether the river water of the River of Time, once it flowed out, would naturally form those complete rules and Great Daos.

Or did it undergo some transformation to form the Great Daos?

Otherwise, Great Daos wouldn't form so simply.

Opposite him, Shadow Marquis remained calm, speaking softly, "This place is the most important to the myriad races. Even if the guarding force is sufficient, any risk would prompt Blood Severing Marquis and others to return! Compared to a single Marquis Huoyun, this place cannot be compromised."

He continued softly, "The Human Race once controlled this place, so both Dingjun and I know the situation. Cultivating the Dao there is much faster than elsewhere! Faster cultivation is one thing, but if you're lucky enough to capture some rules and Great Daos, you can integrate them into your own Dao or switch Daos—it's all fortuitous! This is also the greatest opportunity for Daofuse Realm experts!"

"The Human Race's Daofuse Realm experts have dwindled, while the myriad races have increased, because they have complete control over this place. 6,000 years ago, the Human Race and the myriad races jointly controlled it!"

Shadow Marquis said softly, "If Nameless friend is willing to help, attacking this place would force the myriad races to abandon the siege on Marquis Huoyun."

Marquis Dingjun was furious, "Nonsense! If Divine Fire Mountain has only 3 quasi-kings, that ghost place has at least double! I'd rather directly attack Divine Fire Mountain, Shadow, don't cause trouble!"

He quickly turned to Su Yu and transmitted, "Emperor Yu, don't listen to this nonsense! That place is highly valued by the myriad races, far more than Marquis Huoyun. The hidden strength of the myriad races is likely all there! There might even be top experts close to the master of rules level!"

Su Yu nodded slightly and transmitted, "So, is this guy trying to trap me?"

"Not necessarily, maybe just testing... Shadow is suspicious by nature. He might not have bad intentions, but if he wasn't careful, he would have been killed long ago. Please forgive him, Emperor Yu."

Su Yu nodded again and transmitted, "You've been to the Land of Dao Source. I ask you, can that place enter the River of Time?"

"It can!"

Marquis Dingjun quickly replied, "The Land of Dao Source is vast, not smaller than Chaos Mountain. That entire region can open the River of Time. It's also a sacred place for cultivation. Cultivating there makes it easier to comprehend the Dao, and advancing to Eternal and Daofuse is much simpler! Compared to the Lower Realm, it lacks much of that... that pressure. I can't describe it well, but cultivating there feels very relaxed."

Su Yu nodded, that made sense.

Thinking of this, Su Yu asked again, "Where is the gate to the Lower Realm?"

"It's in that region, but it doesn't usually appear. Only when many people from the myriad races or the Human Race die does the gate manifest. Nearby experts from each race will sense it... For example, if 10 Eternal experts from the God Race die, nearby God Race experts will quickly sense the gate's specific location. This gate moves, but only within the Land of Dao Source."

Marquis Dingjun sighed, "Our Human Race has lost control of this region, so even if many Eternals from our race die, even if we sense the gate's appearance, we can't reach it!"

"Where exactly is it?"

"To the east!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. Chaos Mountain was to the west, and the Land of Dao Source was to the east, one in the east and one in the west, right at the poles.

This was probably not a coincidence but intentional by the Human Emperor, because opening the Dao near Chaos Mountain might be influenced by it.

Being farther from Chaos Mountain would reduce interference significantly.

Moreover, once the Dao was opened in the Upper Realm, the ancient beasts in Chaos Mountain might resist.

If the Dao was successfully opened, Chaos Mountain might be suppressed, and like the Lower Realm, all signs from the era of opening the heavens would quickly disappear.

Assimilated!

"This place is not easy to attack," Su Yu remarked.

Marquis Dingjun quickly nodded in agreement. "Of course, it's not easy. Attacking here is even harder than attacking Divine Fire Mountain."

"The strength of the myriad races is greater than expected. There's a group of strong individuals from the Source of the Dao, and another batch at Divine Fire Mountain. According to Marquis Shadow, their training grounds also have a batch of strong individuals. Are you sure there are only seventy to eighty Daofuse Realm experts in the Upper Realm?"

Marquis Dingjun looked embarrassed. "Six thousand years ago, there were about that many. But in recent years, we don't know. Although advancing to the Daofuse Realm causes a big commotion, we didn't dare to investigate. We've been hiding, so we're not clear about the current situation of the myriad races."

Su Yu was speechless. In other words, the intelligence he had was essentially six thousand years old. Marquis Falling Star and the others rarely mentioned these matters in their memories. Of course, it was possible that Su Yu hadn't seen it. He didn't dare to look too deeply; these beings had lived for over a hundred thousand years. If he were to go through all their memories, would he still be Su Yu, or would he become Marquis Falling Star or Marquis Modang? That was hard to say.

Su Yu only selected some important parts to view, treating them like stories, but he didn't dare to immerse himself in them and experience everything they had gone through.

Opposite him, Marquis Shadow noticed their sound transmission and seemed to be discussing something. After waiting for a while, he spoke up, "Dingjun, are you and this nameless friend willing to take action?"

Marquis Dingjun frowned. "Shadow, you're an old hand. Why do you keep urging us? We don't want anything to happen to Huoyun. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Which time did we ever go all out to rescue someone? The reason we few humans are still alive isn't because we're strong, but because we're more patient!"

"When Minshan was alive, he repeatedly said that in such situations, we must give up! Shadow, when did you become so impatient? If you were like this before, you'd be dead by now!"

He was somewhat annoyed. "And Yingwu and Yunshui aren't the kind of people who lose their cool easily. Are you trying to lure them out on purpose?"

Marquis Shadow spoke softly, "I have no such intention. I'm just thinking that this nameless friend seems quite strong. Huoyun is also strong, stronger than you and me. If we can save him, that would be the best outcome! The situation in the Lower Realm is unclear, and there are only six of us left in the Upper Realm. If Huoyun dies... when the Lower Realm opens, should we save it? If we do... we'll be going to our deaths."

He sighed. "At this point, some things have reached a dead end."

Marquis Dingjun frowned and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Su Yu was weighing the pros and cons. Should he save them? Su Yu didn't want to risk his life. To be honest, he wasn't familiar with Marquis Huoyun. Why should he take the risk and bring his subordinates into danger? They might lose a few of them, and that would be a huge loss!

However, the concentration of the myriad races' forces at Divine Fire Mountain might make it convenient for him to accomplish some things. He flicked his fingers, releasing a bit of chaotic power.

"Chaotic power, Control King's lineage, the black jade left by the West King's Consort, the myriad races..."

One thought after another flashed through his mind.

"Blue Sky, Great Zhou King, Great Ming King, September, Grandstar, Marquis Dingjun, plus me, that's seven Daofuse Realm combatants. If we add the steward under Marquis Dingjun who can break through at any time, that's eight. Plus this Marquis Shadow, that's nine!"

Nine Daofuse Realm experts, plus a Heavenly King, could accomplish quite a bit.

Su Yu stroked his chin and looked at Marquis Shadow with a smile. "You said that if we attack the gods and demons, the other side still has strong forces left. But not all races are as strong as the gods, demons, and immortals, right?"

Marquis Shadow looked at him.

Su Yu smiled. "Why do we have to attack the gods, demons, and immortals?"

Marquis Shadow said solemnly, "If we don't attack the demons, they won't retreat! Even if other races' Daofuse Realm experts leave, it won't affect the overall situation."

"The gods, demons, and immortals are the main forces. As long as these three races remain stable, even if the other races are in chaos, it won't have much impact."

Su Yu laughed. "Why do we need them to retreat?"

"Nameless friend, do you mean...?"

Marquis Shadow said solemnly, "Are you suggesting we use Huoyun's life to exchange for an opportunity to attack other races?"

Su Yu chuckled. "What do you mean by using Huoyun's life... I don't even know him, and I can't save him! It's just an unavoidable situation. Since he can draw away more than twenty Daofuse Realm experts, that's actually a good thing... Why not kill a few Daofuse Realm experts to accompany Marquis Huoyun in death? If Marquis Huoyun dies, he'd probably be happy. What do you think?"

Su Yu laughed. "The east is close to the Source of the Dao, where there are too many strong individuals! Divine Fire Mountain is close to the south, so it's best not to go there either! That leaves the west, which is nearby, and the north, which are the best areas for an attack! The training grounds of the gods and demons are mainly in the central region... Why not make the west the main attack point? I remember this area is where the Nether Race's training grounds are concentrated, right?"

Marquis Shadow remained silent.

Su Yu continued with a smile, "Why not kill a few Nether Race Daofuse Realm experts for fun! If we can draw away Marquis Blood Severance and the others, that would indirectly save Marquis Huoyun. If not... there's nothing we can do. What do you think, Marquis Shadow?"

Marquis Shadow was silent for a while before speaking, "What you say makes sense. Perhaps... this is the only way. But the Nether Race is not weak either. The Daofuse Realm experts who went to Divine Fire Mountain might only be one or two, maybe just one... while the Nether Race has seven Daofuse Realm experts on the surface! Among them, one is a quasi-king!"

Su Yu smiled. "What do you mean by 'on the surface'?"

"It means not counting those at the Source of the Dao!"

Marquis Shadow said solemnly, "Because of the Source of the Dao, humans can't get close now. We don't know the exact situation, except for themselves."

Su Yu nodded. "So, their main base has at most seven Daofuse Realm experts!"

"Correct."

Marquis Shadow probed, "How many Daofuse Realm experts can you bring?"

He added, "Moreover, while Daofuse Realm experts are strong, the Nether Race also has many Eternal Realm experts. Three to five aren't a match for a Daofuse Realm expert, but thirty to fifty... even a Daofuse Realm expert could be killed! It may look like only seven Daofuse Realm experts, but they can unleash the combat power of ten Daofuse Realm experts..."

Su Yu ignored him and instead smiled. "Marquis Shadow, would you be willing to join us in action?"

Marquis Shadow hesitated for a moment, looked at Marquis Dingjun, and after a long time, said solemnly, "I can!"

He wanted to follow these people to probe their depths. He also wanted to figure out who these people were and how strong they really were.

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun also breathed a sigh of relief. Dealing with the Nether Race wasn't too dangerous. He knew the strength of Su Yu's side, and dealing with the Nether Race was manageable.

After some thought, Marquis Dingjun transmitted a message to Su Yu, "Emperor Yu, why did you directly capture me last time, but with Shadow, you talked for so long and even invited him to join instead of capturing him?"

He felt a bit... unsatisfied. It wasn't fair! He thought that Blue Sky and the others had disappeared to secretly capture Marquis Shadow. Why wasn't that the case? It was frustrating! Of course, he knew that capturing Shadow, Su Yu probably wouldn't kill him. Since he received this treatment, he actually hoped Shadow would receive the same treatment, and then he could have a heartfelt talk with Shadow, telling him to accept his fate. But now, there was no such step!

Su Yu laughed and also transmitted a message, "Because... I haven't found his true body!"

"Hmm?"

Marquis Dingjun was slightly taken aback, while Su Yu smiled and said, "Marquis Shadow, if you take action, I hope you use your true body. This avatar, though strong, would shatter with a single poke if it encounters a Daofuse Realm expert!"

Opposite him, Marquis Shadow's body stiffened slightly!

Su Yu chuckled, "No need to be too guarded. I can roughly lock onto the location of your true body. If I really wanted to harm you, I could cause a bit of commotion at the River Ming training ground, and you'd be noticed."

Su Yu looked into the distance, where the nearest training ground to Chaos Mountain was, with a Daofuse Realm expert stationed there.

Su Yu smiled, "You're from ancient times. I'm a junior, so it's only polite to be courteous... But always being on guard against me isn't good!"

After saying that, Su Yu looked into the distance again and smiled, "Don't run around with your true body. If you cause too much commotion, it won't be good for you."

Marquis Shadow's avatar stiffened again.

Su Yu looked in that direction, and at this moment, a faint eye appeared on his forehead, looking into the distance. He smiled, "A little to the left, then to the right. Do you want to meet the River Ming Dao Master?"

"Heaven... Heaven Gate!"

Marquis Shadow's body was extremely stiff as he looked at Su Yu, filled with disbelief and shock.

Heaven Gate!

The other party had opened the Heaven Gate!

Trying to hide in front of someone who had opened the Heaven Gate was a joke.

Even Blue Sky, if he used the power of the Great Dao to disguise himself in front of Su Yu, it would be a joke.

Because, your Great Dao is just there, and with the Heaven Gate open, what can't be seen?

At this moment, Marquis Shadow was filled with shock and awe, no longer as calm as before. He hurriedly asked, "Who are you? You've opened the Heaven Gate, who are you?"

Opening the Heaven Gate required many things.

An unparalleled talent!

No inherited cultivation method!

Without these, how could you open the Heaven Gate?

What does this represent?

It represents inheritance!

His eyes showed a hint of horror. "Do you have the inheritance of His Majesty the Human Emperor or the four Human Kings?"

Are you their descendant?

Is that so?

It seems only their descendants would have the opportunity to open the Heaven Gate!

Su Yu actually wanted to say no, because the cultivation method he used to open the Heaven Gate wasn't obtained from them, but from the Martial Emperor.

However, since the other party asked this way, Su Yu still smiled, "Guess!"

Guess?

Marquis Shadow felt like vomiting blood. He didn't expect to receive such an answer!

I don't want to guess; I just want to know if it's true!

Su Yu smiled, "Alright, enough nonsense. Let's target the Nether Race. It's close by! We'll act tomorrow morning, and you'd better not expose yourself..."

"Tomorrow?"

He was taken aback again. "Why tomorrow? There's still nine days before Divine Fire Mountain launches..."

Su Yu was speechless. "Why should I cooperate with them?"

"..."

With those words, Marquis Shadow was stunned for a moment, then quickly showed a bitter smile.

Yes, why cooperate with the myriad races?

Those words sounded so familiar.

In those days, some of the Human Race's powerful figures had said similar things: in war, the key is to take the initiative rather than passively defend. Yet, for the past 6,000 years, the Human Race had not launched a single proactive war. They had grown accustomed to passive defense, to being on the receiving end.

Su Yu quickly chuckled and said, "Tomorrow morning, wait for me here. I hope to see your true form."

"I... understand," replied the Shadow Marquis, casting a glance at Su Yu before leaving, a hint of melancholy in his steps. Who exactly was this person?

As soon as he left, several people appeared beside Su Yu. Su Yu smiled and said, "Let's go to the Dragon Race's territory."

The Marquis of Dingjun was momentarily stunned. "Aren't we waiting for him?"

Beside him, Lantian rolled his eyes. "Are you stupid? What if he's a traitor? It was just a casual remark. If he really is a traitor, it's best to notify the myriad races now and wait at the Nether Race's side. Meanwhile, we can have some fun with the Dragon Race! Tomorrow morning... by then, the battle will be over!"

Lantian sneered. Was this Marquis of Dingjun really an ancient war general? How could he be so naive!

The Marquis of Dingjun stood there, dumbfounded, and after a moment, he let out a bitter laugh. You guys are too wary of the Upper Realm! Attacking the Nether Race is a ruse, and fighting tomorrow morning is also a ruse! Which of your words is true?

At this moment, his mind was blank. Forget it, you guys are ruthless. I'll just follow along and do my part. As for the rest, I won't concern myself with it.

The Shadow Marquis was supposed to come over tomorrow morning... but perhaps it wouldn't even be necessary. By tomorrow morning, the battle might already be over.

Su Yu was planning to attack the Dragon Race! The Dragon Race was to the north, quite a distance from the western Nether Race!

The Marquis of Dingjun wore a blank expression. Whatever! Forget it, I won't bother with it. My role now is just to kill. Whoever you want me to fight, I'll fight. It's that simple!

At this moment, he felt as if he had returned to ancient times. Back then, wasn't it the same? Orders came from above, and he just led his men to fight. Simple as that!
