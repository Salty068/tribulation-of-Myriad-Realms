Chapter 733: Reaching Consensus

Soul Burying Mountain.

A group of people emerged from the passageway. As they stepped out, Lantian took a deep breath of fresh air... and accidentally inhaled a bunch of bugs. He even stuck out his forked tongue to lick them.

Instantly, everyone around him moved away.

Heavendoom glanced over and nudged Grandstar, whispering, "Is he your brother?"

"Little Heavendoom, don't speak ill of me!" Lantian chuckled, reaching out to pat Heavendoom's large head, causing Heavendoom to stiffen.

Having his head touched was uncomfortable!

He wanted to hit him, but after considering it, he realized he probably couldn't win. His own leader wasn't here, and among the eighteen people present, he was the weakest.

Heavendoom looked pitifully at Su Yu, hoping he would restrain Lantian!

This weirdo being around made Heavendoom very uncomfortable.

Lantian, still smiling, didn't care whether Heavendoom liked it or not. He indulged in the moment, savoring the air before slowly saying, "There hasn't been much conflict in the Upper Realm these days. It seems the first Myriad Races Council has ended, but they didn't reach a consensus."

"A bunch of rabble!" Su Yu commented lightly. The Great Zhou King wasn't surprised and said softly, "That's normal. Such a significant matter, affecting the entire Upper Realm's war, can't be resolved in just ten days or half a month."

Not everyone is Su Yu.

Moreover, the myriad races aren't a single race. Each has its own demands. Resolving everything and reaching a consensus to start a campaign within ten days... unless there's complete unification, no one can make a decisive call!

So, the Great Zhou King wasn't surprised at all.

Even Yingwu remarked, "It's normal. Even in ancient times, not everything could be resolved just because there was a consensus. The Human Emperor needed the Myriad Races Council's approval for some matters, and mutual constraints were common! Often, a single issue could be discussed for years, even thousands of years."

Hearing this, some people sighed.

Indeed, even the ancient Human Emperor couldn't act arbitrarily. The myriad races imposed restrictions, and some matters were delayed endlessly.

But Su Yu, having started from scratch with a small foundation, had a different approach.

The races he subdued and cooperated with were directly subjugated, not merely allied. Su Yu didn't even want mere alliances.

When Duobao came to join, Su Yu refused.

In such circumstances, Su Yu's side achieved high efficiency.

A decisive call, with no objections.

Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so swift.

Su Yu nodded slightly, chuckling, "It's easier with a small foundation, and building from the ground up naturally speeds things up. Once time drags on and more voices join in, some matters become difficult to handle."

Su Yu laughed, "Take the Luminous Domain Mansion, for instance. While I'm here, early issues aren't too problematic. But later, when the tail wags the dog, and people rely on seniority and bully others, family clans rise... by then, it'll be the same! Starting is easy, maintaining is hard."

Su Yu spoke with deep emotion, and the others' expressions changed slightly. The Great Zhou King smiled, "With Emperor Yu here, I believe these things won't happen."

"Let's not talk about the distant future!"

Su Yu smiled, "It's irrelevant. If I'm not around, who cares! If I am... unless I grow old and weak, probably... none of this will happen!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, and the others listened silently, taking note.

Su Yu didn't say more. Seeing everyone quiet, Lantian quickly spoke with a grin, "The second Myriad Races Council seems to be convening soon."

He had left some avatars in the Upper Realm, but many were destroyed during the last escape.

Of course, some remained.

However, being in the Lower Realm, these avatars were cut off from communication. Only upon returning could he receive some information.

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Any news on Hundred Battle? Was he captured or what?"

"He escaped."

Lantian said, suddenly laughing, "Isn't it interesting? The myriad races are spreading rumors that Hundred Battle is a waste, causing trouble wherever he goes. The Ninth Tide's human race suffered a crushing defeat, all blamed on Hundred Battle. They even say he's lustful and will soon get entangled with Moon Luo again..."

Lantian recounted the rumors from the Upper Realm, and everyone's expressions turned strange.

Some people's eyes shifted, sneaking glances at Su Yu.

Even Marquis Huoyun was beginning to suspect... could the myriad races be colluding with Su Yu?

Otherwise, these words... it feels like Su Yu spread them!

Did Lantian fabricate the rumors?

Or was it simply Lantian's avatars spreading them?

Seeing everyone looking at him, Lantian said innocently, "Why are you looking at me? I didn't say anything. This is the territory of the myriad races. Why would I say anything reckless here? It seems several major strong races are spreading it together! It's very effective. Now the entire Upper Realm knows that Hundred Battle is a big waste. No need to worry about him; if he runs, he runs."

Several ancient marquises felt a bit embarrassed.

Though Hundred Battle was a bit reckless, he wasn't as useless as the myriad races claimed, right?

It's disgraceful!

A dignified generation's Human Lord, said to be useless by the enemy, despite being incredibly powerful and perhaps the strongest today, yet the myriad races say he ran away, and it's fine; wherever he goes, he causes trouble. This... this makes people want to die just hearing it.

To make the enemy fear you, that's impressive.

To make the enemy think it's no big deal if you run, that's truly useless.

Su Yu chuckled, "Ignore him. If he ran... he still has some skills! Let's go, visit the Iron Devourer Race."

Just as Su Yu was about to move, Heavendoom urgently said, "Where are Xia Longwu and the others? I want to see them..."

Lantian chuckled, grabbing him by the neck, "Little Heavendoom, don't be like this. Be good, okay?"

"......"

Heavendoom was helpless.

Fate plays tricks!

Once, I could hit whoever I wanted. Now, anyone who wants to hit me can.

It's truly a sad story!

Seeing this, Su Yu also laughed, "Lantian, be polite to Senior Heavendoom. He's of a certain age, not easy! Charging around like a twenty-year-old, it's quite rare. In the future, when we fight the Heavenly Sovereigns, we'll still rely on Heavendoom!"

Heavendoom felt a bit embarrassed.

He felt like this was a mockery.

Forget it, he wouldn't argue with Su Yu.

Su Yu chuckled, stepping into the air, and a group quickly followed. The Great Zhou King and the Great Ming King swiftly concealed everyone's aura.

Soul Burying Mountain was not close to Bamboo Mountain, but everyone here was a top-tier expert. They traveled unimpeded, and even if they encountered some weaker beings, the latter might not even see them. As for stronger beings, solitary Daofuse cultivators were almost unseen now!

Su Yu had acted three times, killing so many experts. Now, which Daofuse from the myriad races dared to travel alone?

Even envoys traveled in groups of three or five, never venturing alone.

...

Bamboo Mountain.

September and the others were still in a state of melancholy.

Suddenly, a powerful aura surged, and in the blink of an eye, before the few Daofuse could react, a large Iron Devourer Beast appeared before them.

"Father!"

"Ancestor!"

"March!"

"......"

A group of Iron Devourers was overjoyed, greeting him one after another.

Marquis Giant Bamboo and March were from the same era. April was his son, May his grandson, and Full Moon was an unknown descendant. March had the highest seniority here, even older than Marquis Giant Bamboo.

Of course, the key was that he was more powerful.

March appeared even larger than Marquis Giant Bamboo. At this moment, he had no interest in eating bamboo. He landed instantly, nodding to his descendants.

Then, he paused.

Looking again, he paused once more.

He extended a finger to count the heads, "One, two, three, four, five?"

March's dark circles vanished.

Strange!

Five?

How come there are five Daofuse in our lair?

Weren't there four?

Including himself, there should only be five!

Counting again, March asked in surprise, "Did our race produce another Daofuse?"

He looked at September, who also looked at March, quickly saying, "Ancestor! I'm September, inheriting Ancestor February's Devouring Dao."

That's your father's Dao!

March was stunned. He looked at the other Iron Devourers. Marquis Giant Bamboo coughed lightly, "It was hard to contact you, so we didn't. September came from the Lower Realm."

"Huh?"

March was stunned again, "The Lower Realm passage opened?"

"No, he came through another passage."

Marquis Giant Bamboo briefly explained, quickly adding, "You should know about the previous events, March. It was related to me..."

He briefly recounted the story of sending Su Yu to kill, and then... March was dumbfounded.

He looked at Marquis Giant Bamboo, then at September and the others, saying blankly, "Those guys... you sent them to kill?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo looked melancholic, "No, I just asked them to kill three Daofuse to show their capability. Who knew they would kill so many quasi-kings."

March's large face was filled with shock and speechlessness. After a long while, he said, "Damn! If I'd known... if I'd known, I should have helped those guys. I saw them run into the River of Time, chased by Mo Tianzun and Yue Tianzun for a day and night, and then there was no news... could they be dead?"

Saying this, he looked at September again, "You just said you inherited whose Dao?"

"Ancestor February's!"

March sighed, "My missing father, is he really dead? I was hoping... maybe... there was still hope! I thought he might have left with the Human Emperor, but... he's really gone!"

September hurriedly said, "It was the Control King's doing. Later, Emperor Yu came to our realm, unsealed it, and Ancestor February left some remnants, allowing me to inherit the Devouring Dao."

"Good child!"

March patted September's large head, sighing, "From now on, you're like my son..."

April was speechless.

May couldn't help but say, "Grandfather, September is June's great-grandson. June is my nephew!"

The seniority is all messed up!

What do you mean, like your son?

Does that mean I have to call September uncle?

"Same thing, doesn't matter."

March didn't care much about these things. Inheriting my father's Dao, can't call him father, right?

Whatever!

Marquis Giant Bamboo, on the other hand, was happy to watch the show. It had nothing to do with him. He and March weren't from the same lineage. The Iron Devourer Race had several lineages, and strictly speaking, Full Moon was from his lineage.

Marquis Giant Bamboo and March quickly assessed the situation. "March, the myriad races want us to attend the Myriad Races Council. What should we do?"

"We have no choice!" March shook his large head, sighing. "Those old fellows like Heavenly Venerable Mo have been keeping an eye on me. I can't stay in the Source of the Dao anymore. I had to come back. Now that I'm back, they won't bother me for a while. But if I don't attend the meeting, they'll come looking for me eventually!"

Troublesome!

He had been living peacefully on the mountain, but now he couldn't stay because those Heavenly Venerables were watching him. It probably had something to do with him leaving the mountain earlier. As soon as Hundred Battle was unsealed, he ran out, and naturally, Heavenly Venerable Mo and the others kept a close watch on him.

Destiny's situation was much better. No one bothered him from start to finish, and the myriad races didn't pay much attention to Destiny either. That guy was just a bystander at the meetings, not saying a word, as if he didn't exist.

March glanced at September, about to say something, when suddenly his eyes widened, looking into the distance with a slightly serious expression. Soon, Marquis Giant Bamboo also widened his eyes, looking into the distance.

After a while, April widened her eyes.

Then May widened his eyes!

Next, September widened his eyes, and finally, Full Moon widened her eyes!

The six Iron Devourers all widened their eyes, looking in that direction. March said gravely, "What's going on?"

The Iron Devourers were all tense.

Marquis Giant Bamboo said in a deep voice, "The myriad races... are they besieging us?"

So soon, and they hadn't even said they wouldn't attend the meeting yet.

And now they were here?

Full Moon, who had widened her eyes, looked a bit confused and whispered, "What's happening?"

"......"

September glanced at her, silently thinking, My dear Full Moon is so adorable, not knowing what's happening, yet widening her eyes.

May also coughed lightly, "What's happening?"

"......"

September was speechless for a moment and said, "What's going on?"

They couldn't help it; they hadn't sensed anything. But March widened his eyes, and if they didn't follow suit, they'd seem out of place, especially since April and May had widened their eyes first.

March wasn't in the mood to care. At this moment, he was genuinely serious, even heavy-hearted. He vaguely sensed incredibly powerful auras approaching. Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't sense it clearly, but March did.

A group of strong individuals!

Probably no fewer than five quasi-kings!

A siege by the myriad races?

Or something else?

With such strength, even if he were here, they might be wiped out!

Heavenly Venerable-level experts were formidable, but even the strongest Heavenly Venerable wasn't a master of the power of laws. Hundred Battle could fight several Heavenly Kings, but an ordinary Heavenly Venerable could only manage three at most. A stronger one might handle five... but that would be top-tier!

March wasn't the top-tier. He might have a chance against three or four, but more than that, no chance.

Moreover, the opponents seemed to have more than just a few quasi-kings; there were many top-tier existences!

At this moment, March was extremely serious. He glanced at Bamboo Mountain. This place was the foundation of their race in the Upper Realm, and there was no time to escape!

He was about to order the Iron Devourer Race to hide when suddenly, a faint ripple came, "Human Lord Su Yu, sorry to disturb you, Senior March!"

"......"

The group of Iron Devourers was stunned. September glanced at March, muttering, "Ancestor... it's Emperor Yu. There's no need to be so afraid."

What's the ancestor doing!

Wasn't he supposed to be very powerful?

It's said he's already a Heavenly Venerable!

Emperor Yu is here, but there's no need to be so scared, right? His eyes are about to pop out!

Marquis Giant Bamboo also sensed it at this moment, his eyes widening again as he looked at March, quickly transmitting, "There weren't so many before, just one quasi-king... this..."

The two strong individuals exchanged a glance, unable to hide their shock.

Where did so many strong individuals come from?

At this moment, the void rippled, and a group of people appeared.

A faint formation ripple spread out, concealing the heavenly secrets.

Su Yu was at the front, the others behind him. Su Yu smiled, slightly bowing to March and Marquis Giant Bamboo, "Everyone, Su Yu is late. This must be Senior March? Greetings, Senior. Your strength is indeed unparalleled!"

March didn't respond, glancing at the group.

Eighteen!

Six had the aura of quasi-kings, and seven had the aura of top-tier Daofuse.

Marquis Giant Bamboo had said there was just one quasi-king?

No, he said Su Yu might have stepped into the quasi-king realm, so that would be two!

How are there six?

He glanced around, then suddenly looked at Doubao and Fat Ball.

At this moment, Doubao was sleeping on Fat Ball's head, while Fat Ball wagged its tail, looking around curiously, like a little house dog. In fact, it was. It hadn't been out for a long time.

Seeing March looking at him, Fat Ball forced a smile on its dog face, continuing to look around.

Then, seeing March still staring at him, Fat Ball couldn't help but ask curiously, "Why are you staring at me?"

March was startled, instantly sobering up. He looked at Su Yu again, taking a deep breath, "March greets the Human Lord!"

After speaking, he looked at Fat Ball again, taking a few more glances.

Su Yu smiled, "Shall we go down and talk? Senior March, do you know Fat Ball?"

He saw March staring for a while. Could it be that they knew each other?

But Fat Ball seemed not to recognize March.

March took a deep breath, "Is this... the one from the Culture King's family?"

Fat Ball looked curiously, "Have we met? I don't remember."

"No."

March said in a deep voice, "However... when my father was alive, he once said that the Culture King sought his advice on how to cultivate the Devouring Dao, how to transform it, to make it suitable for his family's dog to cultivate... When I saw this fellow Daoist... and with Doubao here, I had some guesses."

"Oh!"

Fat Ball didn't care much, but Doubao recognized March. At this moment, it opened its eyes drowsily, as if just waking up, glanced at March, then at the other Iron Devourers, muttering, "I'm seeing things!"

They all look the same!

March ignored him. Don't talk about us; your Iron Devourer Race is similar, all looking the same!

March suppressed his thoughts, quickly saying, "Let's go down and talk. Sorry for not welcoming you earlier! Was it the Human Lord who was observing me in the Source of the Dao before?"

Su Yu smiled, "I was presumptuous. I was investigating the strong individuals in the Source of the Dao that day, and Senior happened to be there, so I took a look."

"No wonder, it was the Heaven Gate!"

March sighed, no wonder he could see him.

As he spoke, he glanced at the others. He recognized Marquis Huoyun, who had good luck and had entered the quasi-king realm.

He didn't recognize Wan Tiansheng and Lantian.

He knew Doubao and guessed Fat Ball's identity. Looking at the Great Zhou King, he felt familiar yet strange.

Looking at the others, each was strong!

Except for that big monkey, who was a bit weak!

He glanced for a while, seemingly recognizing the big monkey, and asked, "Are you Heavendoom from under Hongmeng?"

Heavendoom looked at him, feeling he couldn't win, and nodded, "That's me!"

"Congratulations!"

March congratulated, "Retiring from the guardian position was lucky. I heard back then that after guarding for a thousand years, you could also become a marquis. I was wondering if you became a marquis, whether Brother Hongmeng could hold on. Unexpectedly, this guarding lasted a hundred thousand years!"

He sighed.

Today, he saw many old acquaintances and saw Marquis Tongtian. He glanced at him but didn't greet him, feeling a bit strange.

Marquis Tongtian was out too?

This guy talks too much, forget it, don't argue with him, or it would be endless.

...

A group of people quickly descended into the grand hall.

At this moment, March barely regained his composure. With a wave of his hand, two chairs appeared above, smiling, "Please, Human Lord!"

After speaking, he transformed into a simple middle-aged man, sitting on the right chair, leaving the left for Su Yu.

Su Yu smiled, not being polite, and sat down directly.

The others also took their seats.

At this moment, September grinned, stepping forward to pour tea for everyone, secretly amazed. Emperor Yu had brought out all his resources!

So many people came!

Moreover, it felt like many had grown stronger.

No wonder the ancestor's eyes widened earlier.

Was he shocked?

"The agreement between the Human Lord and Giant Bamboo, I heard from Giant Bamboo before. Giant Bamboo was being reckless. If I had known it was so dangerous..."

Su Yu smiled, "It's fine. Marquis Giant Bamboo only wanted to kill a few Daofuse for fun. It just so happened that I captured Ziyan from the Control King's lineage. I was thinking of bringing out this lineage, and along the way, kill a few quasi-kings in the Source of the Dao to make the myriad races take notice."

Along the way!

March was speechless. Such arrogance!

But he had to admit, it was beautifully done, leaving no trace, even making him think it was the work of the Chaos lineage.

Seeing Su Yu surrounded by many strong individuals, he couldn't help but ask, "Human Lord... could you introduce them?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course, it was my oversight!"

"Senior March knows Fat Ball and Doubao, from the Culture King's Residence. Marquis Huoyun should know better than I do. The Great Zhou King was once a follower under the Human Emperor's banner and one of the three leaders of the Torchbearers. Director Wan Tiansheng was the principal of my academy during my study period, and Deputy Director Lantian is also an elder from my academy..."

He introduced them one by one, and March was slightly shaken.

First, he was shocked by the complex backgrounds of these people. Second, he was surprised by Lantian and Wan Tiansheng, unable to resist asking, "Director Wan and Deputy Director Lantian, how old are they?"

They seemed quite young.

Su Yu smiled, "Director Wan is slightly older, 102 years old in human years, while Deputy Director Lantian is a bit younger, in his seventies."

"......"

March was at a loss for words.

What does it mean to be slightly older?

How are we old fellows, who are over a hundred thousand years old, supposed to respond to that?

He felt helpless. In this tide, the human race had produced several prodigies. So young, yet they had reached the quasi-king level!

Wasn't it said that after sealing Hundred Battle, the human race wouldn't produce any Daofuse?

So, the myriad races sealed him for nothing?

If they had known, the myriad races might have gathered their strength to eliminate Hundred Battle long ago!

Because sealing him was useless, so why bother?

March thought about these things, looking at these people, still unable to hide his shock.

Suppressing his emotions, he asked, "This time, Human Lord... did you go down to the lower realm and come back up?"

Su Yu nodded and smiled, "Back then, when the two Heavenly Sovereigns chased me, I couldn't match them. I had no choice but to escape, first descending to the lower realms to gather my forces before coming back to join the fray!"

He spoke as if traversing between realms was a simple task.

Su Yu continued, "This time, I've come to the Iron Devourer Race and met with Senior March. I won't beat around the bush—I'll be straightforward. Would the Iron Devourer Race be willing to form an alliance with my Luminous Domain Mansion?"

"Luminous Domain Mansion?" March detected something amiss and pondered, "This Luminous Domain Mansion... is it different from the Human Race?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Not much difference, really. It's just that I can't represent all of the Human Race. Besides, the Luminous Domain Mansion includes many powerful beings from various races. When traveling outside, it's best not to mention the Human Race to avoid awkwardness for the seniors."

March silently contemplated this, then said, "Giant Bamboo mentioned before that as long as the Human Lord meets his requirements, our Iron Devourer Race will naturally support the Human Lord!"

"The Human Lord fought in the Source of the Dao and killed several quasi-kings, releasing Hundred Battle. He's even stronger than Giant Bamboo described, and he suffered no losses himself... truly impressive. Our race has been allied with the Human Race for many years, so forming a new alliance is only natural."

He paused for a moment before continuing, "May I ask, is there any chance for reconciliation between the Human Lord and the Control King's lineage?"

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "Impossible."

March pressed on, "What if the Control King's lineage is willing to submit to the Human Lord...?"

"How could that be possible!"

March persisted, "Human Lord, what if, by any chance...?"

"Kill!"

"......"

March hesitated, "Kill... what do you mean?"

Su Yu laughed, "Kill them all to end the trouble! Why keep them around? That lineage is ambitious, ruthless, and treacherous, having wiped out all the Human Race's foundations in the last tide. Of course, they should be eradicated!"

March was silent for a while before speaking again, "The Human Lord should be aware that the path of September was unsealed by the Human Lord."

Su Yu nodded, "I know! Senior February was killed, likely by the Control King! The enmity of a murdered father is irreconcilable!"

"Our Iron Devourer Race is probably not as strong as the Control King's lineage..."

March said heavily, "Moreover, that lineage is, after all, of the Human Race, sharing the same origin! My concern is that if the Control King's lineage submits in the future, and the Human Lord..."

He paused, then softly said, "March won't say much more. If the Control King's lineage truly submits to the Human Lord, March has only one request: allow the Iron Devourer Race to withdraw from the Luminous Domain Mansion..."

Su Yu raised his hand to interrupt, "No need for requests! The Control King's lineage... to be honest, there might be many of them, perhaps more than we can imagine! Some might not even be of the Control King's bloodline... I won't meddle with these. Whether they submit or not, the main lineage of the Control King will be exterminated! Not a single one left! As for the others, we'll see!"

Su Yu smiled, "If there are those who have never left Chaos Mountain and know nothing of the situation, killing them is pointless! If Senior March can accept this, then the alliance is not a problem! If you insist on exterminating all unrelated individuals, I don't mind, but it might cause some unrest among the Human Race."

March suddenly breathed a sigh of relief, "That's enough! Punish the main culprits; the others are ignorant, unaware of their own heritage. March won't hold them accountable."

That was his main concern.

He had been prepared for February's fall.

However, knowing it was the Control King's doing, if he still did nothing, and Su Yu truly subdued the Control King's lineage, how would he face himself?

Su Yu laughed, "I've gathered many allies. Not to boast, but to this day, no ally has ever said I treated them unfairly! I stand for fairness, rules, and loyalty."

Here, only March hadn't interacted with him before, so Su Yu was straightforward, "Rest assured, Senior March. If the Iron Devourer Race ever truly wishes to leave, as long as you do one thing, you can leave freely. I won't stop you! Just inform me before you go, and don't stab me in the back. Even if you leave openly and join the myriad races, I won't utter a word against it!"

With that, Su Yu said solemnly, "This applies to everyone! Leave if you wish! Just don't turn against me from within my ranks. That would be the best outcome for both sides!"

Below, the Great Zhou King, sensing the tense atmosphere, laughed, "Brother March, the Luminous Domain Emperor's word is as good as gold. Since he has spoken, he will surely act accordingly! Today, we are all witnesses. The Emperor of the Human Race has never broken his promises."

"It's not doubt..."

March explained, "It's just that my father's death left some lingering resentment, which might have amused you all!"

He quickly smiled, "The Human Lord's response is satisfactory. If the Human Lord has any orders, March will do his utmost, without shirking!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Senior is straightforward! The Iron Devourer Race is also straightforward!"

March smiled but said nothing more.

The reasons for agreeing so readily were manifold.

First, Su Yu's side was not weak.

Second, Marquis Giant Bamboo had already agreed.

Third, the lower realm's Iron Devourer Race had already pledged allegiance to Su Yu.

Fourth, the Iron Devourer Race was not having an easy time. Having allied with the Human Race for so many years, even though they didn't participate in the Ninth Tide, the myriad races were watching them. At this time, any misstep could make them a target.

Fifth...

In short, after considering and weighing the situation, March felt it necessary to ally with the Human Race.

Of course, whether to exert full effort for Su Yu would require further observation and assessment.

However, this Luminous Domain Emperor was likely not simple.

Even though March hadn't interacted with him before, he had witnessed the large-scale fall of quasi-kings in the Source of the Dao. This one was much more astute than Hundred Battle.

Su Yu, after a brief conversation with March, learned that the myriad races had invited them to a meeting.

This was expected.

Su Yu wasn't surprised. Discussing this with March, Su Yu smiled, "Attend! I was already considering how to infiltrate the myriad races' council to gather firsthand intelligence!"

Su Yu laughed, "The Iron Devourer Race should attend and agree to participate in the battle! As the vanguard, to kill the Control King's lineage, that's no problem!"

Seeing March's apparent concern, Su Yu quickly reassured, "Don't worry, I won't make it difficult for you! Blue Sky and I will infiltrate, disguised as the Iron Devourer Race. It won't be a problem, and others will hide among the Iron Devourer Race!"

He and Blue Sky had unique paths, making it difficult for others to detect their disguise.

For others, even the Great Zhou King, it would be easy to expose themselves in the presence of a Heavenly Sovereign.

"Human Lord... are you going to Ren Mountain?"

March hesitated, "That place, this time, the myriad races' council, will likely be filled with powerful beings! The old ones from the Source of the Dao will probably all appear! There should be no fewer than five Heavenly Sovereigns, the risk is too great!"

Su Yu smiled, "Taking risks is necessary. In the current situation, it's impossible not to take risks! Even with the addition of Senior March and these Heavenly Kings, do you think we can match the myriad races?"

March shook his head, "We can't match them! The myriad races have Heavenly Sovereigns like Mo Heavenly Sovereign, Moon Heavenly Sovereign, Desolate Heavenly Sovereign, Nether Heavenly Sovereign, Demon Heavenly Sovereign, Dao Heavenly Sovereign... and these are just the ones I know. Some old ones might have completely sealed themselves, and I might not even know! As for the quasi-king realm, the three major races, even though many were killed, those who were killed, the Human Lord should know, were all born later!"

Su Yu nodded, "All six were born later after changing paths!"

March nodded, "The Human Lord knows, that's best! The three major races have more than just these quasi-kings who changed paths. There are quite a few who haven't changed paths. After the Ninth Tide, when the Human Race was destroyed, the three major races took over everything the Human Race left in the upper realm, including the foundations of the extinct ancient races, all divided among the three major races!"

March sighed, "As far as I know, the three major races now have no fewer than 15 quasi-kings, with at least five per race! The Human Race's destruction made the myriad races prosperous..."

"Hundred Battle is useless!"

Su Yu's words resonated with everyone present.

Hundred Battle is useless!

The Human Race's destruction truly enriched the myriad races.

Before the Ninth Tide, the myriad races didn't have such strength. But with the Human Race's fall, the allied ancient races' fall, the myriad races inherited all the Human Race's and allied races' legacies, even a large number of Daofuse corpses. How could they not prosper?

More than 15 quasi-kings, just from the three major races.

Other races like the Nether Race, Dragon Race, Phoenix Race, Ape Race... those who could leave Daofuse in the lower realm likely have Heavenly Kings in the upper realm.

Su Yu sighed, "In these six thousand years, the myriad races have probably produced more quasi-kings than in the previous hundred thousand years!"

March smiled wryly, "That's true! In the previous hundred thousand years, everyone restrained themselves, targeted each other, and some strong ones occasionally fell. But in the recent six thousand years... the internal strife among the myriad races has been minimal, all accumulating strength, preparing to erupt into a war among the myriad races after exterminating the Human Race..."

"In the Source of the Dao, even if they fought for the Great Dao, it might take hundreds of years for a Daofuse to fall. When the Human Race was around, if they fought, a Daofuse might die every three to five years... so the number of Daofuse remained stable, without large-scale increases."

March sighed, "Look at our race. We now have several Daofuse, including me! Because we've been targeted for these six thousand years, it's actually quite few. Some ancient races that were weaker than us now have more Daofuse than we do!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "So, if we can avoid exposure now, we should! If we do get exposed, we must weaken all sides' strength! At least maintain a tripartite balance!"

"Not to the point where one side can easily wipe us out with a little effort!"

Su Yu smiled, "Now, with Marquis Giant Bamboo and Senior March, our strength isn't too weak."

March nodded slightly, contemplating for a moment before saying, "If the Human Lord truly intends to accompany us to Ren Mountain, he must exercise restraint!"

He was worried that this person might employ the same tactics at Ren Mountain as he did at the Source of the Dao, which would be extremely dangerous!

"Of course!" Su Yu chuckled. "I'm not foolish. I'll only fight if I can win. Why seek death if I can't?"

As they were chatting, suddenly, Su Yu and his group all turned their gazes westward. March's expression changed slightly, and Su Yu also frowned.

The Great Zhou King turned pale. "The aura of Hundred Battle?"

What on earth!

At this moment, from the extreme west, a formidable aura surged. In the next instant, even from Bamboo Mountain, they could vaguely hear a thunderous roar: "Moon Luo, I will kill you!"

"......"

The group exchanged glances, March looking at Su Yu with a speechless expression.

Su Yu, equally speechless, turned to Marquis Huoyun and the others, finally saying after a long pause, "No matter what, Hundred Battle was once a Human Lord, a leader! Is his temper really this volatile? At a time when all the myriad races are watching him, searching for him, he just exposes himself like this?"

"......"

Marquis Huoyun and the others had complex expressions. Even the Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, helplessly saying, "He... he probably held it in for thousands of years and got so angry he lost his mind. Perhaps he encountered Moon Luo?"

That might be it!

Otherwise, after hiding so well for so many days without making a sound, he suddenly erupted. Clearly, he couldn't hold back any longer!

Su Yu thought for a moment, helplessly saying, "Too impulsive! But for us, it's a good thing. Perhaps Moon Luo has appeared, which also confirms the existence of the Chaos Mountain lineage. Now, the myriad races are probably all focused over there."

The group sensed for a moment, feeling a wave of fluctuations, but it quickly disappeared.

Along with it, Hundred Battle's aura also vanished swiftly.

Su Yu sensed again and said, "He might have entered the Chaos Mountain region, and his aura is being concealed! The myriad races are unlikely to enter Chaos Mountain at this moment, but knowing that both Hundred Battle and Moon Luo have entered, the Myriad Races Council and several Heavenly Sovereigns will likely strive to reach a consensus quickly!"

The appearance of Hundred Battle and Moon Luo would only spur the myriad races to accelerate their cooperation.

For Su Yu, this was indeed beneficial.

Otherwise, if things dragged on, Su Yu would worry about unexpected changes, and the battle of Chaos Mountain might not erupt.

March said gravely, "Hundred Battle has entered Chaos Mountain. If that place is indeed the enemy's lair, Hundred Battle is in grave danger! He still has a seal on him that hasn't been undone!"

Su Yu waved his hand dismissively. "Ignore him! He's too impulsive. Moon Luo might have deliberately lured him into Chaos Mountain... and he actually chased after him. If something happens, it's his own problem!"

Su Yu said coldly, "If you get into trouble, you deal with it yourself. Don't expect others to rescue you! The same goes for everyone. If you encounter trouble during a mission or have to fight the myriad races, we'll help if we can. But if you get into trouble due to your own recklessness... I won't pay a greater price for one person!"

At this, he looked at Heavendoom.

Heavendoom looked innocent. "I'm not more impulsive than Hundred Battle, am I? I have my limits. Hundred Battle is foolish; I'm just impulsive and battle-hungry. It's different!"

Why are you looking at me?

At this point, the Great Zhou King and the others were at a loss for words.

Hundred Battle, how pitiful.

Even Heavendoom, this reckless fellow, looks down on you. There's really nothing more to say!

Su Yu also chuckled.

He nodded. "True, when you can't win, you run fast. I know that much."

Heavendoom was frustrated. The way you put it, if you can't win, would you still fight?

If you can't win and know you'll die, unless you have no choice, why not run?

Su Yu ignored Hundred Battle. It was a good thing; entering Chaos Mountain meant the battle there would definitely erupt.

He stopped talking about it and quickly said, "I'll impersonate April, and Blue Sky will impersonate May!"

Blue Sky said gloomily, "Forget it, I'll impersonate Full Moon. I won't be your son!"

"......"

On the side, September hesitated, "No, please! If you impersonate Full Moon, I'll have a psychological shadow!"
