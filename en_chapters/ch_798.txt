Chapter 798: Changing Circumstances

"Courting death!"

At the moment when Fat Ball devoured the willpower of the Poro Dragon Beast, a massive portal in the distance trembled slightly.

A furious shout echoed across the heavens and earth!

It was the true form of the Poro Dragon Beast!

At this moment, the voice could already be transmitted from behind the Gate of Hell, indicating that the portal was not far from being fully opened.

Simultaneously, as the furious shout rang out, Su Yu's angry curses overshadowed it.

At this moment, Su Yu was furious, roaring, "Beast! You killed my two Heavenly Kings, I will see your entire race annihilated!"

"..."

Goodness!

That furious shout—anyone unaware might have thought that the self-destruction just now wasn't orchestrated by Su Yu.

Damn it, wasn't it Su Yu who caused Xuelan and the others to self-destruct their Great Daos?

Before the Control King's lineage could even express their anger, the roars of two furious individuals resounded across the heavens, leaving no room for the Control King's lineage to express their rage.

Su Yu roared, "Kill!"

The four Heavenly Sovereigns, having destroyed the willpower of the Poro Dragon Beast, charged straight towards Yue Hao.

Yue Hao had initially come to fight because of the presence of the Poro Dragon Beast.

No matter what, it was a top-tier existence. Unfortunately, it relied heavily on the Six Portals. Strictly speaking, its strength was achieved, but its dependency was too strong. Once the portal was broken, that creature was finished.

At this moment, Yue Hao, who was controlling the ancient beast's corpse with his willpower, felt his sea of will tremble and turned to flee without a word.

There was no choice!

The four Heavenly Sovereigns were not something he could contend with.

Further behind, Yue Luo and several others also turned pale and quickly broke through the air to pursue. However, the white-haired elder and the three Heavenly Kings had to stop due to injuries from the portal's explosion. The remaining three Heavenly Sovereigns and nine Heavenly Kings quickly gave chase!

Yue Luo roared in anger, equally furious.

This bastard Su Yu, mixing truth with lies, made everyone uncomfortable.

The key was that Su Yu's choice to self-destruct two Heavenly Kings' Great Daos against the Poro Dragon Beast was crucial. Not only was the Poro Dragon Beast finished, but one Heavenly Sovereign and three Heavenly Kings were also heavily injured due to the portal's explosion. This exchange was too worthwhile!

In an instant, it was equivalent to neutralizing the combat power of two Heavenly Sovereigns and three Heavenly Kings, while Su Yu's side only lost three Heavenly Kings.

This scene left all parties feeling both relieved and delighted!

In such a grand battle, it was truly nerve-wracking. A slight mistake could lead to total annihilation, yet Su Yu maneuvered with ease, employing exchange tactics with masterful skill!

The more intense the battle, the calmer Su Yu became.

...

At this moment, Tiangu couldn't help but sigh, exclaiming, "A born killer, a war general!"

Indeed!

Su Yu was both a commander and a war general.

In such circumstances, the disparity in combat power was still significant. Yet, through easy exchanges, the gap was narrowed in the blink of an eye. In an instant, the combat power of the Heavenly Sovereigns was once again balanced, leaving only those below the Heavenly Sovereign level on the opposing side!

At this moment, not only Tiangu but also the myriad races, including the two ancient beast powerhouses, Chaos Dragon and another, were slightly shaken.

Su Yu!

This guy, despite his seemingly disgusting tactics, achieved astonishing results. Even if those three Heavenly Kings hadn't died, in such a grand battle, losing three Heavenly Kings to render two Heavenly Sovereigns and three Heavenly Kings unable to fight was a huge gain!

Moreover, Marquis Tongtian had even managed to escape with his people.

The Great Dao had collapsed, everyone saw that, but a collapsed Great Dao didn't mean it couldn't be restored.

Marquis Tongtian had fled, and under such circumstances, the Control King's lineage was unlikely to pursue. They fled into the depths of chaos, making it difficult to chase, and there was also the concern of Su Yu mobilizing forces to ambush them!

Hearing Tiangu's exclamation, everyone refrained from retorting, including Dragon Heavenly Sovereign.

However, after a while, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign still snorted coldly, displeased, "What else does he know besides making people self-destruct?"

"Try getting a Heavenly King to willingly self-destruct first!"

Tiangu retorted unceremoniously, not for Su Yu's sake, but to prevent these people from using such excuses to comfort themselves, to underestimate Su Yu, and to harbor disdain. Saying such things in front of everyone could lead to some underestimating Su Yu.

Clearly, Su Yu's command was astonishing, his tactics appropriate. If Dragon Heavenly Sovereign's words influenced others to think Su Yu only knew how to make people self-destruct, it wouldn't be good.

Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, having been retorted, wanted to get angry but thought better of it.

The Immortal Race wasn't easy to provoke!

Moreover, right now, they were still in a period of alliance.

Their battle with the ancient beasts continued, with people constantly falling, but compared to the other side, despite hundreds of strong participants, it seemed somewhat like a minor skirmish!

...

At the same time.

Su Yu and the others, freed from the burden of the three Heavenly Kings... to be honest, the three Heavenly Kings' explosive power wasn't as strong as theirs, their speed wasn't as fast, and they were indeed somewhat of a burden.

Now, without Marquis Tongtian and the others, Su Yu and the others moved even faster.

At top speed, they charged towards Yue Hao!

The pursuers behind were slower than Su Yu and his group.

All were Heavenly Sovereigns, but on Su Yu's side, both Su Yu and Fat Ball were top-tier existences. March and Giant Axe were slightly weaker, but they were still Heavenly Sovereigns. Yue Hao, controlling the ancient beast's body, wasn't as smooth in his control.

In the blink of an eye, Su Yu and his group were about to catch up!

At this moment, within the mountains, Yue Zhan was sweating profusely, not because of Su Yu and the others, but because he was strenuously opening a small gap in the Gate of Hell. Seeing the situation, he growled, "You two, go assist in the battle!"

He wasn't alone.

There were several strong individuals with him.

Among them, two looked like twins, almost identical. Upon hearing his words, they rose and quickly vanished.

Yue Zhan cursed under his breath!

Useless!

So many strong individuals went to intercept Su Yu and his group, yet they ended up in such a sorry state. It was truly infuriating.

Of course, as long as they could block Su Yu and his group, they were doomed!

Even four Heavenly Sovereigns wouldn't be enough!

...

Su Yu and his group were chasing Yue Hao when suddenly, two figures emerged from the distant mountains, charging at an incredible speed.

Two more Heavenly Sovereigns!

At this moment, the myriad races were all taken aback!

These were the sixth and seventh Heavenly Sovereigns to appear today. Including the Poro Dragon Beast, there were actually eight. Yue Zhan hadn't appeared yet, Yue Qin was killed, and Yu Qing hadn't emerged from the Gate of Hell!

If all were counted... the strength of the Control King's lineage was terrifyingly formidable!

They had been dormant for a hundred thousand years!

Indeed, their strength was still there.

At this moment, Su Yu and his group, with Yue Hao in front, made it three Heavenly Sovereigns. Behind them, including the injured white-haired Heavenly Sovereign, there were also four Heavenly Sovereigns.

Even Su Yu had to marvel!

This lineage was truly strong.

The myriad races combined, to be honest, were only equivalent to the Control King's lineage.

And the myriad races were a coalition of multiple races.

The Control King's lineage, strictly speaking, was just an organization under the command of a single Human King of the Four Extremes, yet their strength was absurdly formidable. In this era, neither Su Yu nor Hundred Battle had subordinates as strong as this lineage!

"Your Majesty!"

At this moment, March and Giant Axe were both startled. Two more had come!

This was troublesome!

They were already at a disadvantage, but their mobility was stronger. However, now, with strong enemies both in front and behind, if surrounded, with seven Heavenly Sovereigns attacking, along with those Heavenly Kings and Daofuse experts, the four of them would definitely be doomed!

At this moment, Su Yu roared, "Are the myriad races still going to watch? Seven Heavenly Sovereigns have appeared, are you still waiting? Do you have to wait until the Master of Rules appears?"

He roared, and the next moment, he shouted, "Retreat!"

Boom!

With a punch, he shattered the void, creating a passage. Su Yu dove into the passage and fled, the three other strong individuals following without hesitation, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Yue Hao, along with the twins, quickly regrouped with Yue Luo and the others, their faces grim as they watched Su Yu and his group retreat. The strong individual wielding an axe beside Yue Luo shouted angrily, "Chase them!"

Fight and then flee, how could it be so easy?

All seven Heavenly Sovereigns had been exposed!

Yet Yue Luo and Yue Hao remained silent. Soon, the elder with a pale face from the explosion of the Gate of Hell flew over, coughing, "Don't chase a cornered enemy!"

In reality, they couldn't chase!

They had to guard this place!

Once they pursued, capturing Su Yu and his group would require more than four Heavenly Sovereigns, five or six would be needed. If so many left, what if the myriad races attacked?

Thus, Su Yu and his group had much greater mobility.

These individuals, on the other hand, had to guard their territory.

"Set up the formation!"

The white-haired elder coughed and quickly ordered, "Set up the Heaven-Sealing Formation, seal the four directions first!"

Not a binding formation, but a sealing formation, sealing themselves.

At this moment, the white-haired elder quickly transmitted to several Heavenly Sovereigns, "We can't chase, but we must be cautious of them launching another surprise attack! Wait! Wait for Yu Qing Supreme to emerge from the Gate of Hell, otherwise, even if we kill these few, the losses will be heavy!"

At this moment, Yue Hao's voice came, filled with some anger and helplessness, "I know, but this group is extremely troublesome!"

Troublesome!

To be honest, provoking Su Yu and his group left them very frustrated.

In reality, it was Su Yu, that bastard, who first ambushed them, leading to the deaths on Su Yu's side.

But now, Su Yu was seeking revenge on them!

It was outrageous!

In the distance, Su Yu and his group reappeared.

Su Yu, with some surprise, exclaimed, "Damn, you bastards aren't chasing me? Damn! I beat you like sons, and you still won't chase me? Come on, send a few Heavenly Sovereigns! You're even sealing yourselves, have you no shame?"

Yue Hao and the others remained cold and indifferent, staring across the distance.

The next moment, Su Yu turned and left, silent, while March and the others only focused on fighting, not concerning themselves with anything else.

Moments later, Su Yu's whereabouts surfaced.

Boom!

An ancient beast was blown apart by his punch, and March and the others immediately began slaughtering.

In the blink of an eye, four Daofuse giant beasts were blown apart on the spot by the four of them!

The Eight-Winged Dragon, who had been idly watching the battle against the myriad races, suddenly changed its expression. In that instant, Su Yu and his companions struck down several ancient beasts. Not only that, but Su Yu shouted fiercely, "Kill!"

His target was the Eight-Winged Tiger. The four powerful figures broke through the circle of ancient beasts almost instantly, charging forward.

The Eight-Winged Tiger roared, flapping its wings, and transmitted a message, "Emperor Yu, it's just an act, just an act..."

Boom!

An act?

Su Yu's assault was too swift. The experts under his command followed his lead—if Su Yu attacked, they attacked. Who had time for acting?

No acting!

Su Yu's thoughts were simple: the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon were not good creatures. If they could be killed, so be it. If not, then it was just an act!

Yes, it was all for the sake of making the act more convincing!

You couldn't say I wasn't acting!

Boom!

The power of the Great Dao erupted. March swung a bamboo staff, the Giant Axe cleaved the void, and Fat Ball stomped down with a boot, devouring the void itself. The chaotic power around the Eight-Winged Tiger was instantly consumed by Fat Ball!

"Blade!"

Boom!

A blade slashed out, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to shatter. The Eight-Winged Tiger didn't have time to escape. With a swish, one of its eight wings was severed.

The Eight-Winged Tiger's eyes turned blood-red in an instant!

"Roar!"

With a furious roar, a large number of ancient beasts came to its aid. Su Yu coldly shouted, "Are all the myriad races dead?"

Boom!

At that moment, powerful figures like Thunderstorm and Destiny joined the fray, swiftly slaughtering numerous ancient beasts.

The Eight-Winged Tiger was genuinely enraged. Just as it was about to explode in fury, its eyes changed, casting a deep glance at Su Yu. Su Yu, with a smile on his face, transmitted a message, "Brother Tiger, quickly retreat to the depths! A large number of ancient beasts are coming. You and the Tailless Dragon can harness the power of the ancient beasts and gain the trust of the Control King's lineage, which will be more beneficial for your future plans!"

It seemed as if he was thinking of the Eight-Winged Tiger's best interests!

The Eight-Winged Tiger hadn't even had time to escape when—boom, boom!

Su Yu tore through the void, and the Five Elemental Prison appeared, sealing the heavens and the earth. Chains pierced through the void, reaching out to capture it.

The Eight-Winged Tiger cursed inwardly!

Damn!

Was this really an act, or was he trying to kill me?

What a bastard!

The tiger was smart enough to understand Su Yu's intentions at a glance. Since it was hard to distinguish friend from foe, it was better to kill first and act later... Fine, they shared the same thought!

Indeed, humans were the most cunning!

At this moment, the Eight-Winged Tiger couldn't care about anything else. It roared, "Retreat!"

With that, its remaining seven wings flapped instantly, shattering Su Yu's Five Elemental Inferno. With a punch that hit nothing, the Eight-Winged Tiger quickly fled. Over there, the Chaos Dragon reverted to its true form, roared, and with a tail swipe, sent Thunderstorm flying, quickly retreating with some ancient beasts.

Su Yu didn't care about any of that, frantically slaughtering those ancient beasts!

At this moment, these ancient beasts were all fleeing. Su Yu and his companions, mixed in with the myriad races, were frantically killing. In the blink of an eye, the four Heavenly Sovereigns had killed nearly twenty Daofuse ancient beasts!

Su Yu swung his blade again, and over there, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign's face changed, roaring in anger, "Stop!"

Only then did Su Yu stop, looking at Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, who roared in fury, "What are you doing?"

At this moment, in front of Su Yu, a giant dragon was trembling, eyes full of terror!

Su Yu took a closer look and sneered, "Heavenly Dragon Marquis? I thought it was an ancient beast! They all look the same! I thought I had killed all the dragons, but it turns out there are still a few stragglers!"

"Su Yu!"

Dragon Heavenly Sovereign was furious, "What exactly do you want? Return my Dragon Coil Mountain!"

Su Yu sneered, "Return what? What did I take from you? Stop spouting nonsense! A bunch of useless people, fighting for so long, and all for nothing? Over ten Heavenly Sovereigns, and you've killed less than twenty Daofuse ancient beasts. Useless!"

"Retreat!"

With a low shout, Su Yu and the four powerful figures quickly retreated into the void without stopping. Su Yu was also worried about being surrounded and killed by these guys, so he decided to run first!

Once he had also fled, the myriad races finally had time to assess the situation.

Upon seeing it, Moon Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly, "He took all the ancient beast corpses, including... our people!"

Both sides had fought a battle earlier, killing about twenty ancient beasts, and the myriad races had also lost seven or eight Daofuse.

Nearly thirty powerful figures, most of whom had bodies.

These were supposed to be collected after the battle, but Su Yu, taking advantage of the chaos, had somehow sneaked in and taken all the corpses!

Bastard!

This guy really was eating from both sides!

Meanwhile, Tiangu couldn't be bothered with any of this. Looking into the distance, he frowned slightly, "Everyone, are we still waiting? Seven Heavenly Sovereigns, plus those two ancient beasts just now, nine Heavenly Sovereigns, and a quasi-ruler of laws... Do we really have to wait for another ruler of laws to appear?"

He was a bit annoyed!

In the lower realm, even if he lost many battles, to be honest, he was still decisive. Every major battle was a full-scale assault, and the Immortal Race was always at the forefront of clashes with Su Yu.

But upon reaching the Upper Realm, the way these people fought made him quite frustrated!

More than ten Heavenly Sovereigns, and they weren't pressing forward. Instead, they insisted on waiting for Su Yu's side to finish probing.

A bunch of useless people!

Tiangu cursed inwardly!

That's really what he thought!

Did they really have to wait for the other side's ruler of laws to appear before they were satisfied?

Now, Su Yu had run away. Su Yu had also noticed their hesitation and simply ran away. Anyway, he wasn't in a hurry. As long as he could gain some advantage, it was fine. As for the three Heavenly Kings, they weren't dead, and Marquis Tongtian had eaten a Heaven Gate last time and advanced to Heavenly King. Maybe this time, there was hope for a Heavenly Sovereign!

If he really became a Heavenly Sovereign, Su Yu would have profited. Why should he be anxious?

But what about the myriad races?

Apart from losing seven or eight Daofuse, they gained nothing!

Tiangu's words made the former Empress frown slightly as well, saying, "Everyone, the one from the Control King's lineage is clearly trying to connect. Are we... still waiting?"

The Upper Realm's combat attitude was something they weren't quite used to.

It was a bit... a bit procrastinating!

Yes, procrastinating.

Not as decisive as the lower realm!

The lower realm may have been defeated, beaten by Su Yu until they were in disarray, but that didn't mean they weren't decisive. Each time, they pressed forward with full force, with all Daofuse joining the battle. It could only be said that Su Yu was too monstrous.

But what was the situation in the Upper Realm?

Just now, Su Yu's side was fighting like that. In fact, Tiangu wanted to press forward, but the other Heavenly Sovereigns seemed a bit unhurried, wanting to wait and see.

Too much pursuit of perfection!

They insisted on Su Yu revealing the entire strength of the Control King's lineage!

At this moment, Moon Heavenly Sovereign was silent for a while, then said, "We definitely have to fight! But... what we're considering is, if the losses are severe..."

Tiangu was a bit annoyed and said no more.

I guessed it!

These guys, the first thing they thought of was, if a full-scale war broke out and several Heavenly Sovereigns died, what would happen next?

Annoying!

...

In the distance, on a mountaintop.

Su Yu looked towards the myriad races, lost in thought. After a long while, he said, "The people of the Upper Realm have become somewhat useless!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Six thousand years of dominating the Myriad Realms, six thousand years of fake battles! It has made them somewhat indecisive!"

Fake battles!

That's what Su Yu said. March wanted to say something, but after a long time, couldn't find the words.

Yes, it was fake battles!

They had fought in the Land of Dao Source for six thousand years, but not many had died. Before the Ninth Tide, the Human Race was still in the Upper Realm, and at that time, it was real fighting. Within three to five years, a Daofuse would definitely die!

That's why the number of Daofuse wasn't high.

But now, in three hundred years, a Daofuse might not even die!

Too comfortable!

Dominating for six thousand years!

In this regard, they were not as good as the lower realm. The lower realm had been fighting for over four hundred years, and the battles had never ceased.

Su Yu looked over there and sighed, "They're more useless than I expected. I thought after we made our move, they would press forward, whether it was Tiangu, Jiwu, or Demon Halberd... At this moment, they should have led their people forward! But they didn't!"

This was actually beyond his expectations!

Before this, he thought the other side would quickly bring people forward, blocking the appearance of a ruler of laws. But... damn it, they didn't!

This was also why Su Yu didn't make another move!

Too disappointing!

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "If this is Hundred Battle's intention... then it's... terrifying!"

"Hmm?"

The others looked at Su Yu, who said softly, "Without a great enemy, after six thousand years of peace, they've become too comfortable! The myriad races were never united, and after six thousand years without cooperation, suddenly working together, they are wary of each other, and after six thousand years of fake battles, how much combat power do you think the myriad races still have?"

At this moment, Su Yu saw through the myriad races!

Strong on the outside, weak on the inside!

These four words perfectly described them.

March was silent for a while, then said, "Separated, they might be stronger! But when working together, without a leader, they might actually be weaker!"

Su Yu nodded!

Yes, sometimes it's not about having more people. After the myriad races cooperated, Su Yu suddenly realized that their combat power might not be as strong as when they fought separately.

Three monks and no water to drink?

Su Yu laughed!

A rabble!

Not even as strong as the lower realm. Over there, Tiangu could barely become the leader of the myriad races. When a battle broke out, Tiangu could quickly lead people into battle. In several battles, the myriad races almost always pressed forward with full force!

Here... they came to mess around!

"Your Majesty, what should we do now?"

March asked, not having gained much advantage, and now, with the myriad races not pressing forward, they couldn't make another move. Seven Heavenly Sovereigns united, plus twelve Heavenly Kings, it was hard to fight!

If they continued, they'd be cannon fodder for the myriad races?

Su Yu looked at the Control King's lineage's territory, where a group of powerful figures surrounded the void, ready for battle!

The great formation was set!

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "We don't necessarily have to kill the Control King's lineage! If this group of useless myriad races can hold back even when a true ruler of laws appears from this lineage, then I'll consider them impressive!"

Su Yu narrowed his eyes, "If these guys remain so useless... more of a hindrance than a help, then... if a Master of Rules does appear, we'll seize the opportunity to slaughter them, picking off the corpses! Even the Heavenly Sovereigns of the myriad races won't be spared! Kill whoever we can, everyone in sight is an enemy! Once we're done, we'll find a way back to my world, escape with our people, what do we have to fear!"

Everyone was taken aback. This... Su Yu's shift between friend and foe was too quick. Was he planning to turn against the myriad races?

"A bunch of useless fools, occupying the Great Dao, yet their power is not weak!"

Su Yu said calmly, "That's exactly what I'm lacking right now! This so-called cooperation... is far worse than I expected, the results are too poor, there's no need for cooperation anymore!"

Alright then!

March nodded, sighing slightly. He understood, but there was still a sense of helplessness.

Just now, it was truly a good opportunity.

Seven Heavenly Sovereigns... while the myriad races had over ten!

The other side's ancestor was clearly trying to bring people over, yet they didn't make a move!

...

At this moment, on the side of the Control King's lineage.

Yue Hao and the others watched the retreating ancient beasts with slight frowns.

Although many ancient beasts had died, the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon still led over fifty ancient beasts in retreat. Moreover, more ancient beasts were surging from the depths of chaos!

The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon quickly began to regroup!

The forces of the ancient beasts under their command gathered once more.

The Eight-Winged Tiger looked at Yue Hao and the others from a distance and shouted, "We have come by the will of chaos. Should we join forces to resist, or disperse to fend off the enemy?"

He didn't suggest merging their forces!

Saying so would only make things worse.

Two top-tier Heavenly Sovereigns!

Yue Luo raised her eyebrows slightly, then quickly smiled charmingly, "Two Beast Sovereigns, why not trouble yourselves to construct defenses on the periphery? Soon, the Gate of Hell will open. As long as you block Su Yu and the myriad races, these guys will soon have no way out!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger cursed inwardly!

Humans are treacherous!

They're using us as cannon fodder. We've suffered such heavy losses, and they don't even suggest merging forces. Fine, have it your way!

He quickly said, "Fine! But if the enemy attacks, you must also join the battle. I don't want to face those lunatics alone!"

"Of course!"

Yue Luo smiled, feeling much safer this way.

In a few more hours, Yu Qing would be able to come out!

At this moment, the Chaos Dragon transmitted to the Eight-Winged Tiger, "Eight Wings, what do you think Su Yu is planning? I saw earlier, he nearly killed you..."

"It's fine, it's just a temporary alliance. Brother Dragon... be careful. Here, only you and I can truly trust each other. No one else can be trusted. Humans are treacherous, and the myriad races are no good either. The Control King's lineage is even worse!"

The Chaos Dragon said nothing. Indeed, here, perhaps only the Eight-Winged Tiger and he were truly on the same side. Even the Eight-Winged Tiger had to be cautious.

These days, those with intelligence are becoming more and more cunning!

...

"Your Majesty, what should we do now?"

At this moment, Giant Axe was also a bit anxious. Are we just going to wait here?

That's not good!

Su Yu said nothing, instead looking at his arm, "Have they returned?"

"They have!"

Lantian spoke, "Tongtian brought back the Mountain of Excrement, and Hongmeng is very excited. I think he's about to advance, and Tongtian himself also has hope. Xuelan and Giant Bamboo are both merging with new Daos. We are protecting their paths, so rest assured, Your Majesty!"

A great battle is fought to gain benefits.

If no benefits are gained, then no matter how many are killed, it's meaningless.

If Tongtian and Hongmeng can both advance, then there will be two more true Heavenly Sovereigns, and Giant Bamboo and Xuelan might become pseudo-Heavenly Sovereigns.

Suddenly, Su Yu's side would see a surge in strength.

Not only that, at this moment, Fat Ball was also half-asleep.

It had consumed a large amount of willpower from the Dragon Beast!

At this moment, it seemed to be strengthening slightly. Fat Ball wasn't truly a Heavenly Sovereign; it had opened its own path, the Bite Path, which wasn't very long. After blackening, it became quite powerful, but without blackening, its combat power was only comparable to a Heavenly King.

Su Yu glanced at Fat Ball, then at the Lantian avatar on his wrist, and after a moment of silence, he said, "It seems that the Master of Rules will definitely appear! The myriad races have been raised to be useless... weaker than I expected! This time, if the situation permits, let's first eliminate the forces of the myriad races!"

"At that time, we'll retreat to the Death Realm, the Upper Realm will belong to the Control King's lineage, the Lower Realm to Hundred Battle, and the Death Realm to us... it's good, a three-way split of the world once more!"

The Lantian avatar spoke, "Your Majesty, why don't we go all out now? Maybe we can become the biggest winners!"

Several Heavenly Sovereigns haven't even made a move yet!

If the South King, Hongmeng, and Tongtian all become Heavenly Sovereigns, plus the pseudo-Heavenly Sovereigns, there's still hope of becoming the biggest winners.

"No rush!"

Let's wait and see!

Su Yu glanced around, finally looking at the myriad races, "By now, they should have felt their own problems. Even if they haven't, those from the Lower Realm have! Let's wait a bit longer and see if the myriad races make any changes!"

...

At this moment, the myriad races' forces hadn't moved.

Tiangu still stood up, looking at the former Empress of the God Race, and said solemnly, "Empress, we can't go on like this. The situation is getting worse! Su Yu's side is not weak, and they might have hidden strength! Hundred Battle's side... it's hard to estimate their strength! The Control King's lineage, everyone has seen it! But as for us, at this moment, I suddenly realize we've overestimated the strength of the Upper Realm!"

"The situation was so good just now, yet we were unwilling to press on... such indecisiveness will surely lead to defeat!"

Tiangu said solemnly, "All of you strong ones from the Upper Realm, back in the day, you were all capable warriors. It's only been six thousand years, and everyone has changed! Afraid of death, calculating every little thing, hiding strength, waiting for others to make the first move... if that's the case, then my Immortal Race will take the lead! In this battle, my Immortal Race will be the vanguard, and the other races will temporarily follow our command!"

Several Heavenly Sovereigns were about to speak when the former Empress said, "My God Race has no objections!"

On the Demon Race's side, Demon Halberd couldn't say anything.

But on the Fate Clan's side, Destiny said solemnly, "This can't go on, maybe... you're right, my clan has no objections either!"

Thunderstorm also said, "I have no objections!"

They wouldn't submit to other races, but having a temporary leader was acceptable. The Immortal Race's four Heavenly Sovereigns were willing to be the vanguard, which was still acceptable.

Seeing everyone looking at him, Dragon Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly, "Why are you looking at me? I and Phoenix Heavenly Sovereign have just come out of seclusion and are not too familiar with the situation. If you want to fight, I naturally have no objections!"

Hearing this, Tiangu's eyes brightened. Fortunately, they weren't completely hopeless!

He quickly said, "Then now, quickly surround the Control King's lineage, and contact Su Yu to continue the fight!"

The previous attempt was aborted halfway!

Now, continue the battle!

The other side only has seven Heavenly Sovereigns. Even if they can't stop the Master of Rules from coming out, they can make the other side pay a greater price!

Tiangu quickly looked at Thunderstorm, "Thunderstorm Sovereign, I'll have to trouble you to go find Su Yu again... this time, we'll be the vanguard, and he just needs to seize the opportunity to kill the strong ones from the Control King's lineage!"

Thunderstorm actually didn't want to go!

Seeing his hesitation, Tiangu quickly said, "You and Destiny Sovereign go together! Stay on Su Yu's side, and if Su Yu makes a move, the two of you can act accordingly and join the battle!"

Destiny's eyes were strange, "Tiangu, what do you mean by this?"

"Nothing else!"

Tiangu said solemnly, "I just think that if Destiny Sovereign goes over there, maybe you can play a greater role, and also help us monitor Su Yu, to prevent him from suddenly changing his mind and turning against the myriad races!"

Destiny was speechless!

Tiangu... was he suspicious of him?

Most likely!

Indeed, this guy's mind was still very clear.

Destiny thought for a moment and nodded, "Alright, but... I'll have to trouble everyone to take care of my Fate Clan!"

Tiangu quickly said, "Rest assured, the Fate Clan will handle the aftermath. The Fate Clan is good at going against the flow, and this time, the other side's luck is insufficient. The Fate Clan still has great use, so Destiny Sovereign, rest assured, the Fate Clan will not participate in the frontline battle!"

Hearing this, Destiny Marquis gave him a meaningful look, said nothing more, and quickly looked at Thunderstorm, "Thunderstorm, shall we... go?"

Thunderstorm glanced at him, cursing inwardly. Is it really necessary?

Last time, he went to the Lower Realm with March, and March went to follow Su Yu. This time, he's going with Destiny. Will Destiny also follow Su Yu?

If that's the case... damn it, my position will be very awkward!

...

The two quickly flew towards Su Yu.

Su Yu, who was contemplating how to respond next, was suddenly taken aback. Why are these two coming together?

Moments later, the two stepped through the air.

Destiny spoke directly, "Tiangu is dissatisfied with the various races' passive fighting, agreeing for the Immortal Race to be the vanguard. Thunderstorm and I have come to assist the Human Lord. This time, the myriad races will take the lead, and the Human Lord only needs to kill the strong ones on the other side at the critical moment!"

As he finished speaking, in the distance, on the myriad races' side, the three races' nine Heavenly Sovereigns, plus the three from the Nether, Phoenix, and Dragon races, twelve Heavenly Sovereigns, quickly moved out, advancing together towards the depths of chaos!

Su Yu looked at the two and suddenly smiled, "What assistance? They're worried you won't listen and cause trouble! Now without you two, the three major races can suppress three Heavenly Sovereigns. The Nether and Dragon races have suffered heavy losses in Daofuse, and the Phoenix Race is just like that... they can be suppressed in an instant. Tiangu just threw the troublemakers over here!"

He immediately understood Tiangu's thoughts!

Whether these two were his people or not, it didn't matter. Just throw them to Su Yu's side. With these two here, it would be somewhat obstructive!

The myriad races' changes were swift.

Su Yu smiled, "The myriad races have survived until now... indeed, there are still some smart people!"

Destiny smiled and nodded, while Thunderstorm had a strange look in his eyes.

What's going on?

The tone of Destiny and Su Yu's conversation was different. This... oh my, could these two really be colluding?

Su Yu ignored him and quickly smiled, "Alright, in that case, Destiny, you follow Giant Axe. He's very reckless, and I'm worried he'll be killed! Destiny, you're a smart person, take good care of him!"

Destiny quickly said, "I will do my best!"

Su Yu nodded, then turned to Thunderstorm with a smile. "You... if I kill Moon Luo, you deal with Moon Luo. It's that simple. You must hold him off. If you can't... then you two are in cahoots!"

"..."

Damn it!

Thunderstorm didn't know what to say. At this moment, he suddenly felt that Su Yu's side was actually very dangerous. The danger wasn't from others, but from himself. Destiny might be one of Su Yu's people! This was terrifying! And he was the only one not part of Su Yu's faction!

Su Yu ignored him and quickly said, "Let's go, keep up! I also want to see if the Myriad Races, giving it their all, are strong enough. If they're not... and can't destroy the Sin Race, then today we'll wipe out the Myriad Races!"

Thunderstorm swallowed hard, suddenly feeling truly horrified! Su Yu dared to say such things in front of him and Destiny. No need to guess, Destiny was definitely one of Su Yu's people! It seemed he knew too much! He was indeed a bit uneasy; it was too dangerous. Would he become cannon fodder?

Su Yu seemed to know what he was thinking and said without turning his head, "Apart from self-detonation, you don't have to listen to me. At other times, listen well. I won't target you, but if you dare to mess with me, I'm Su Yu, not one of those useless Myriad Races. I'll be the first to kill you!"

Thunderstorm's heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly said, "I wouldn't dare!"

Only then did Su Yu feel relieved, ignoring him further. He quickly said to Destiny Marquis, "It's good that you're here. With this, we have one more Heavenly Sovereign. If the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger turn against us... today, the chance to destroy the Control King's lineage is great, very hopeful! But don't make it too obvious. At a critical moment, you can go back to rescue the Fate Clan, take them away to prevent becoming cannon fodder!"

Destiny Marquis expressed gratitude, "Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Even at this moment, Su Yu didn't forget to protect the Fate Clan, which moved Destiny Marquis deeply. At this moment, Thunderstorm almost cried. I'm here, you guys could have just communicated through voice transmission. Don't say it in front of me, I'm really scared!
