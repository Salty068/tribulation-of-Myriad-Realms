Chapter 853: The Culture King's World

The boots, the Culture King's boots.

In Su Yu's memory, these were exceptionally powerful artifacts. There were even some intriguing rumors about them. In truth, these boots lived on in the hearts of many. Yet, no one paid them much mind. No matter how strong the Culture King's boots were, they were still just his shoes.

But now, with the information Su Yu had gathered from Gui, he had a new theory: these boots might contain a world within them, and that was the truly terrifying part. Something hidden right before your eyes, yet you fail to recognize it.

Even if you beat the Human Emperor to death, he probably wouldn't have guessed that the Culture King would hide his world inside his shoes!

"The shoe that Fat Ball has... it might be a clue, just like the character in the Culture Tomb that guides others to find the world... So, the Culture King's world might be in the other boot!"

Su Yu made another judgment. It was probably not the one with Fat Ball, because Fat Ball was always on the move. If it were, that would mean the Culture King's world could be moved at will. To solve this, he needed to find Fat Ball and get that shoe.

Ignoring Gui, who was busy condensing a clone, Su Yu reached out and summoned Xingyue once more.

At this moment, Xingyue was somewhat speechless and a bit annoyed. "What is it now?" she asked.

Being summoned repeatedly was quite bothersome. She was busy working! Many were injured, and she was helping them heal. Su Yu kept summoning her, which was very inconvenient!

"Tell Fat Ball to throw its boot into the world and let it flow downstream. I'm too lazy to fetch it myself!"

He didn't even bother asking Fat Ball to return; it was too much trouble. What if the dog got lost on its way back?

"Got it!"

With a wave of his hand, Xingyue disappeared. As she left, she felt like cursing. Summoned at will and dismissed just as easily—wasn't that exactly her situation?

Su Yu was quite excessive!

Su Yu chuckled, then looked into the distance where Gui was condensing a clone. Around Gui, there was a slight illusion, a mirage from Su Yu's world. Su Yu laughed softly and suddenly summoned his Human Lord Seal!

The Human Lord Seal descended like a massive cover, enveloping everything!

Now it was safe!

With the Human Lord Seal here, even if Gui's true form came, it might not be able to break through and leave. A mere clone stood no chance and couldn't possibly succeed!

Meanwhile, at the Heaven Gate, Gui was exhausting its power to transmit the sphere gifted by the Culture King. However, it was evident that the power was not weak, and the transmission would not be completed in a short time.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King also soared into the sky.

He sensed something unusual and furrowed his brows slightly. "Your Majesty!"

Su Yu smiled. "It's nothing, just a first-tier from the Heaven Gate, one that just crossed over. It's only a clone. Let Lantian play with it."

The Great Zhou King had an odd expression.

That really was just playing around!

Lantian had been idle recently, unable to go upstream. Here, he could at least practice his skills.

"The Heaven Gate..."

The Great Zhou King pondered for a moment and said, "Your Majesty should still be cautious. There are extremely terrifying beings behind the Heaven Gate!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

He thought for a moment and asked, "Are you familiar with the Sixth Generation Human Lord?"

"The Sixth Generation Human Lord?"

The Great Zhou King recalled and nodded. "Somewhat familiar, but we didn't interact much. The Sixth Generation Human Lord was also a remarkable figure, though each generation was. However, the Sixth Generation was introverted and taciturn. The Torchbearer lineage supported him back then, so I didn't interfere much."

"Did you know he opened the Heaven Gate?"

The Great Zhou King shook his head but said, "I didn't know during his lifetime, but after his death, I investigated his sudden demise. It should be because he opened one of the Three Gates and was ambushed!"

Opening the Heaven Gate with strong talent wasn't impossible.

At this moment, Su Yu wasn't concerned about that but something else. He spoke softly, "I'm wondering where he got the method to open the Heaven Gate."

The Great Zhou King was taken aback.

Su Yu continued calmly, "The method to open the Heaven Gate is rare and uncommon! Of course, he might have been extraordinarily gifted, having traversed the passage between life and death at the Luminous Domain Mansion, thus mastering the Heaven Gate method himself. Otherwise, there are no written records of the Heaven Gate method. I only learned it thanks to the Martial Emperor's techniques!"

With 720 acupoints and countless methods, how would you know which one could open the Heaven Gate?

Experimenting with each would have killed you long ago.

If not dead, each experiment would result in severe injury.

The Sixth Generation Human Lord silently opened the Heaven Gate. Su Yu was more curious about this point: where did he get the technique?

At that time, the Martial Emperor was still in chaos.

Thinking of this, Su Yu added, "Also, the Hundred Battle lineage seems related to the Human Gate, but they've been fixated on the Earth Gate... That's also a problem. Since you opened the Human Gate, why not enter it and instead focus on the Earth Gate?"

The Great Zhou King was momentarily stunned and couldn't help but say, "The Human Gate might be inaccessible, possibly because its location can't be found, making the Earth Gate more suitable..."

Su Yu waved his hand, shaking his head. "Let me ask you, isn't everyone here trying to open the Heaven Gate? Look at Gui and the others... the ones contacting me. They're all trying to find a way out! The ancient beasts in the Earth Gate are the same! The Human Gate... there's no movement at all. Have you noticed?"

The Great Zhou King raised an eyebrow. "Your Majesty means?"

"Could they have already made arrangements long ago?"

Su Yu chuckled. "Perhaps they've already replaced someone and descended upon the Myriad Realms?"

"Your Majesty is suggesting... Zhou Ji?"

The Great Zhou King was startled. "Could Zhou Ji be the Human Gate's representative?"

Su Yu nodded. "It's just a guess! Zhou Ji seems off. He's indifferent to Hundred Battle and only somewhat concerned about Yu. Saving Yu felt more like maintaining a connection with the Human Ancestor! After all, Yu is a descendant of the Human Ancestor!"

"Hundred Battle opened the Human Gate, and so did Yu. Did Zhou Ji open it?"

Su Yu laughed. "Also, after he severed the human race's physical path, I suddenly realized his strength wasn't significantly weakened. So, where did his power come from after severing the path? I didn't understand before, but now that I've connected with the Heaven Gate, I have a theory... power is being transmitted from the Human Gate!"

On that day, when Zhou Ji severed the human race's physical path, Su Yu actually wanted to kill him.

But he suddenly realized that Zhou Ji's strength didn't seem diminished, so he chose to let it go.

Back then, Su Yu didn't understand the situation.

But now, having connected with the Heaven Gate himself, Su Yu had to consider whether Zhou Ji maintained his strength because someone behind the gate was transmitting power to him.

Is Zhou Ji truly of the Hundred Battle lineage?

Or has someone from behind the gate taken over Zhou Ji's body?

Who knows!

What exactly exists within the Human Gate?

Humans? Myriad Races? Or the Chaos Ancient Clan?

Su Yu had some understanding of the Heaven Gate and Earth Gate, but the Human Gate remained the most mysterious. Apart from knowing of its existence through Hundred Battle, there was almost no other information!

Not only Su Yu, but even the Human Emperor was unclear about the Human Gate. The Human Emperor had some arrangements in the Heaven Gate and Earth Gate, but regarding the Human Gate, he was at a loss. According to the Human Emperor, the Human Gate was downstream of the River of Time, possibly at its end.

Su Yu was merely speculating. The Heaven Gate and Earth Gate hadn't been resolved yet, so knowing a bit about the Human Gate was enough.

These matters should be approached step by step.

As for Zhou Ji... if he's the Human Gate's representative, his entry into the Earth Gate wasn't with good intentions. Perhaps he intended to enter from the start, bringing Yu along... Heh, maybe just as a guide, a pathfinder.

He might be trying to use Yu to find the Human Ancestor!

The Great Zhou King pondered for a moment and suddenly said, "If Zhou Ji is the Human Gate's representative, then the Heaven Gate also has a representative."

"Hmm?"

Su Yu was taken aback. Who?

"The Human Emperor!"

Su Yu frowned. What did that mean?

The Great Zhou King smiled. "After the Human Emperor opened the Heaven Gate, he seemed to have had some contact with a powerful being within it. I don't know the specifics, but they might have fallen out later... However, the Human Emperor might be aware of some things inside the Heaven Gate. If Your Majesty has time, you might want to ask him."

Some things, if you don't ask, others might not bother to mention or might simply forget to say.

Su Yu recalled that the Human Emperor had mentioned before that when dealing with the Immortal Emperor, he was in a weakened state. At that time, he also encountered turmoil from the Heaven Gate. He had to suppress the Heaven Gate, deal with the Immortal Emperor, and handle his weakened state... which led to his severe injuries.

Thinking about it, the Human Emperor was truly formidable.

At his peak, how much power did the Human Emperor possess?

More than 32 paths of power?

If so, that would be terrifying!

At this moment, Su Yu didn't dwell on these matters. He quickly said, "Regardless, after I left, there was some turmoil in the Earth Gate, right?"

The Great Zhou King muttered to himself. He hadn't even had the chance to report it, yet Su Yu already knew. Indeed, Su Yu was the boss here. Any slight disturbance, and he would know immediately.

The Great Zhou King nodded. "Yes, there was such an incident. It might be that those who entered had some contact with the other side, revealing some information about us. The other side thought Your Majesty had gone upstream, so they tried to come out, but I stopped them!"

Who said that?

Su Yu made a judgment. Zhou Ji and Yu?

It's possible!

As for Tiangu and the others, it's also possible, but they would be cautious and avoid contact, so it's unlikely they would actively approach. Of course, the Demon Race is also a possibility.

The Demon Race seems to have an emperor within the Earth Gate.

Was this Demon Emperor deliberately placed there, or did he enter the Earth Gate by accident?

While waiting for Gui's transmission, Su Yu headed toward the Earth Gate.

...

Soon, Su Yu arrived before the Earth Gate.

The portal stood there, seemingly empty behind it, standing in the void.

"If there's chaos behind the Earth Gate, is there a Time Path there?"

Su Yu murmured to himself, casting another glance at the Earth Gate. He had heard that Yiyue and the others were inside, still alive. He wondered if they had ever looked out from the other side.

"Why can't I cultivate the Earth Gate and the Human Gate?" Su Yu pondered. He had some ideas about cultivating both gates. If he could cultivate all three gates, he could connect them. Ideally, he would find three powerful beings, seize the opportunity to eliminate them, or perhaps gain insight into the situation within the gates.

Suddenly, Su Yu asked, "Great Zhou King, why can the lineage of Control cultivate the Earth Gate?"

It seemed that only the direct lineage of the Control King could cultivate the Earth Gate. As for the Human Gate, Su Yu knew it required the opening of 720 acupoints in the physical body. This seemed to depend on one's bloodline.

So why could the Control lineage cultivate the Earth Gate?

"The Control lineage seems to have a bloodline that combines the Control King's blood with that of the Demon Emperor, forming the current bloodline that can cultivate the Earth Gate," Su Yu mused, turning to the Great Zhou King. "Does the demon bloodline have special properties?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and shook his head. "I'm not sure about that. If we trace it back, it's too far in the past!"

Alright then.

Su Yu didn't dwell on it. He felt a bit regretful but continued to ponder if there was a way to cultivate it. His aura fluctuated slightly, and soon, Marquis Tongtian appeared. Su Yu looked at him and asked, "Is there a way for me to open the Earth Gate and the Human Gate?"

Marquis Tongtian, upon hearing the question, thought for a moment and replied, "It's difficult! But Your Majesty could try the method of reversing the bloodline to outline a clone for cultivation!"

He added, "Others who cultivate the Earth Gate and the Human Gate likely have some connection between the two gates. It's not really about the bloodline; it's more about the owner of the bloodline having some association with the gates."

He chuckled and said, "For example, if Your Majesty had a connection with me, then after Your Majesty's death, your descendants could also cultivate my Heaven Gate!"

Su Yu just silently watched him.

Feeling a bit awkward under Su Yu's gaze, Marquis Tongtian realized he might have said too much. "Ahem, Your Majesty won't die, and besides, Your Majesty has no descendants..."

Su Yu continued to stare at him, and Marquis Tongtian, feeling embarrassed, forced a laugh. "I didn't mean to mock Your Majesty! I don't have descendants either. Look, I haven't even found a suitable partner!"

The Great Zhou King rolled his eyes. It would have been better if he hadn't spoken at all. The more he said, the worse it got!

Marquis Tongtian, feeling helpless, quickly changed the topic. "Those who can cultivate the power of the gates likely have some agreement with the gates or perhaps have left an imprint of will within them! For instance, Your Majesty can cultivate the Heaven Gate... which means that your ancestors, or rather, a supreme figure among the human ancestors, left their power imprinted on the Heaven Gate!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Who are our ancestors?"

The Human Ancestor wasn't the one. He was merely one of humanity's former leaders, like the Culture King, Sun, Moon, and Star, who were prominent figures of their era but not the original ancestors of the human race.

The Human Emperor could open the Heaven Gate, and so could Su Yu, as well as the Culture King and others... This suggested that their ancestors might have been the same, which was possible. Could there be a connection with the Heaven Gate?

And the Human Ancestor, did he leave an imprint within the Human Gate? Did the Control King or the Flame Demon Emperor leave an imprint within the Earth Gate?

At this point, Su Yu became interested in the ancient powerhouses from even older eras.

Marquis Tongtian shrugged. "Perhaps it's the Master of Time? If he had descendants, I think they could cultivate all three gates without issue!"

Alright, that made some sense.

The Master of Time... Su Yu was increasingly intrigued by this supreme being. Where exactly was he? Even the Lord of the Undead hadn't died, so Su Yu didn't believe the Master of Time was dead.

As Su Yu pondered, his eyes flickered.

In the next moment, he reached out and grabbed a boot from the void. It was a boot that Fat Ball had sent downstream along the River of Time, flowing into Su Yu's world.

Su Yu held the boot, feeling its power. It was a strong boot. When Fat Ball was at the Heavenly King level, using this boot could elevate him to the Heavenly Venerable level. Even now, using the Culture King's boot, Fat Ball could become much stronger.

Su Yu carefully examined it, raising an eyebrow slightly, not sensing anything unusual.

This meant that if the Culture King's world truly existed, it wasn't within this shoe.

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian couldn't help but comment, "Your Majesty, does the Culture King's shoe smell nice?"

Why was he sniffing it?

He suspected Su Yu had some peculiar hobby. Out of nowhere, he was sniffing a shoe he recognized as belonging to the Culture King.

"......"

Su Yu looked at him, frowning slightly, then smiled. "Interesting! Tongtian, since you swallowed the Martial Emperor's Heaven Gate, it seems you've reverted to your true nature. Do you think you're strong enough now that you're not afraid of me sealing your gate?"

This argumentative gate had been quiet for a long time!

After being intimidated by Su Yu last time, it had been obedient, but today, it seemed to have regained its argumentative nature.

Marquis Tongtian, feeling awkward, said, "Your Majesty jests. How could that be? I was just saying."

Su Yu gave him a meaningful look and said, "Don't get cocky. Even though you've reached the fourth tier and feel like you're close to the third, with your progress speed... don't think that just because you still need to consume gates, even if the three gates themselves revive, they might not catch up to me. Understand?"

"Understood!"

Marquis Tongtian immediately felt awkward and dared not speak further.

Su Yu merely gave him a light reprimand, then looked at the boot in his hand, pondering how to find the other boot!

Where could the other one be?

The world was best opened in chaos.

If not opened in chaos, it would be repelled by the River of Time. Could it be that this boot wasn't in the Myriad Realms but hidden in chaos?

If so, hiding a shoe in chaos wouldn't be a big deal; it would be hard to find.

Su Yu seemed to have thought of something, chuckled, and suddenly drew a pen, tapping it on the boot. The boot emitted a faint glow, but it wasn't enough; it only emitted a glow.

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he considered, then took out the Mark of Civilization. The aura on its cover, originally that of a recipe, trembled slightly.

At that moment, a shadow suddenly emerged from the boot!

While the Great Zhou King and others were stunned, Su Yu laughed and quickly took out a recording talisman, saying with a smile, "The Culture King emerges from his shoe. Indeed, the Culture King has unique tastes, omnipresent!"

The shadow was similar to what Su Yu had seen several times before.

Facing away from all beings, hands clasped behind his back, dressed in white robes.

Su Yu laughed, "So, there really was an imprint left. The Culture King had quite a broad range of interests, omnipresent indeed!"

This guy, the Culture King, left shadows everywhere.

Su Yu had encountered them several times!

Previously, one appeared in the Culture King's Residence, then once in the pen dao, and now, here again.

At this moment, the Culture King's shadow, with its back to him, sighed, "Bearer of the pen dao, I didn't expect you to discover my secret..."

"You're quite impressive!"

Su Yu grinned, "Idiot!"

"Quite impressive indeed!"

Last time, Su Yu had cursed the same way, and this time he continued, while the Culture King's program continued to run, unaffected.

"Do you want to explore my world? Perhaps you'll be disappointed because my world, even if you spend your entire life, you might not be able to inherit it... But that's okay, it should still be of considerable help to you!"

Clearly, this was a last resort left by the Culture King after the pen dao, in case of emergencies, his world.

If he died and his world didn't collapse, the pen dao inheritor might find his world.

One had to admit, the Culture King left quite a lot behind.

Su Yu smiled brightly, "I don't want your broken world!"

"......"

The shadow didn't respond, nor did it have the ability to, continuing, "Being able to discover the secret of the boot means your wisdom, ability, strength, and fortune are sufficient! You've also gained Fat Ball's approval! Otherwise, if Fat Ball didn't voluntarily hand over the boot, once it died, the boot would be useless, and you wouldn't find any clues!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow; there were indeed many methods.

Fat Ball had many things and methods left by this person, including the Culture King's Residence, the Four Great Daos, the Book of Time... Many things were related to Fat Ball, which further solidified Su Yu's belief that he needed to cultivate Maoqiu into a second Fat Ball!

Currently, Maoqiu seemed to be forgotten by everyone, and he needed to leave a nest for himself.

"Of course, if the inheritor of the pen dao is my elder brother... then I'm out of luck!"

The Culture King's shadow spoke again, with a hint of lament, "However, if my elder brother found it, or came specifically to find it... it means he's also nearing his end, and that's fate, unavoidable!"

"Perhaps, by then, I would have already fallen!"

Su Yu couldn't help but laugh. Was he that afraid of the Human Emperor merging with your world?

The Culture King's shadow continued, "Come with me, inheritor. Do you want to guess where my other boot is?"

"I don't want to!"

Su Yu had no interest in guessing, but the Culture King's shadow continued on its own, "You definitely can't guess. Even if you say you don't want to, it only proves you can't guess, can't think of it, which means your intelligence, your wisdom, is still far behind mine. But that's normal. In this world, how many can compare to me?"

"......"

Su Yu laughed, and the Great Zhou King and Marquis Tongtian also grinned. The Culture King's shadow was quite narcissistic. Well, the Culture King was like that; he was indeed narcissistic!

The strong figures of that era all had this tendency.

"Come, follow me. I'll take you to find my boot... You can't imagine where my boot is!"

This time, Su Yu was genuinely interested. Where could it be?

In chaos?

That was the most likely, but judging by the Culture King's tone, it might not be in chaos. Otherwise, he wouldn't say it like that!

If it were truly hidden in chaos, the Culture King wouldn't need to be so arrogant, saying you can't imagine where I hid it.

"Is it in the Culture King's Residence?"

Su Yu pondered, realizing that the heavens and earth inherently possess a certain degree of repulsion. For instance, his own world, now occupying the Upper Realm, and the Human Emperor's world, did not merge; they repelled each other. Previously, in the Death Realm, he too was repelled. Even in the River of Time, there was a repulsion, though not as strong as in the Death Realm.

With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu quickly followed the shadow of the Culture King as it flew forward. At this moment, he had no idea where the Culture King was heading. The Great Zhou King and Marquis Tongtian were also intrigued.

"Where is the other shoe of the Culture King?" Su Yu wondered aloud, more curious than ever. "Did the Culture King later stop wearing shoes? Why does it seem like he only had one pair?"

Tongtian couldn't help but interject, "Your Majesty... doesn't change shoes either, right?"

"......"

Su Yu was taken aback. Really? He looked down at his own boots, black with gold trim, and after a moment of thought, nodded. "Seems like it!"

Where did these boots come from? Oh, they were a gift from the Great Zhou King and others when he ascended to the position of Human Lord. After putting them on, he found them satisfactory and never changed them. Even during battles, like the one with the Chaos Dragon, when they were destroyed, he had them reforged to their original appearance. It had become a habit, and indeed, there was no need to change them.

At Su Yu's level, dust and dirt no longer clung to him. He chuckled and said no more, continuing to follow the Culture King's shadow.

The Culture King's shadow flew all the way to the Lower Realm, and Su Yu followed. Could it be in the Human Realm? Su Yu speculated that it might be, but... wouldn't it be repelled there? Or perhaps the Culture King didn't care about such repulsion. Occupying a small area, the repulsion from the River of Time might not matter.

The Culture King's shadow soon entered the Allheaven Battlefield. Under Su Yu's somewhat surprised gaze, the shadow suddenly stopped. Su Yu looked around, still bewildered. Where was it?

This was the Sea of Stars. Could it be hidden in the sea? That was a possibility! But the next moment, the Culture King's shadow smiled, with a hint of pride, arrogance, and audacity. "Do you know where it is now?"

"I bet you don't, because your wisdom is still far inferior to mine!"

At that moment, Su Yu noticed that the shoe Fat Ball had been holding suddenly floated up. The Culture King's shadow, with a smug expression, said, "Let me show you what it means to steal the heavens and change the sun!"

"Rise!"

With this soft command, the entire sea began to tremble violently under Su Yu's astonished gaze!

At that moment, Su Yu was suddenly shocked! He soared upwards, shooting into the sky, ascending rapidly until he could see the entire Sea of Stars spread out before him!

The Great Zhou King and Marquis Tongtian quickly followed, both somewhat bewildered. Su Yu, after a moment of daze, muttered, "Damn!"

The Great Zhou King was puzzled. What was wrong? He looked down... and didn't see anything amiss. But at this moment, as the Sea of Stars trembled, the Great Zhou King took a closer look. He hadn't paid attention before, but now he couldn't help but murmur, "Tongtian, do you remember what the Sea of Stars looked like on the ground?"

Marquis Tongtian thought for a moment and shook his head. "I don't remember!"

"Then do you think... now... this sea, doesn't it look like a shoe filled with water?"

Marquis Tongtian also looked down carefully, stunned for a moment. "It does!"

No one had paid attention to this before! Su Yu's mouth twitched, and he suddenly cursed with a laugh, "Radiant King!"

The two instantly looked at Su Yu!

Su Yu laughed, "Did the Radiant King suspend the Sea of Stars... Goodness, did the Radiant King swap the Sea of Stars back then, or did the Culture King do it secretly later? If it was swapped that early... it means the Culture King opened the heavens very early, even earlier than the Human Emperor!"

Yes, he had figured it out. The entire Sea of Stars was the Culture King's boot! The boot was filled with water, thus creating the suspended Sea of Stars!

Now he was pondering a question: did this boot appear when the Radiant King suspended the Sea of Stars? If it was then... it could indeed cover up the commotion! After all, the suspension of the Sea of Stars by the Radiant King must have caused quite a stir!

Su Yu suddenly laughed again, "Interesting, was the Radiant King in cahoots with the Culture King? Was he deliberately covering for the Culture King?"

He looked at the Great Zhou King, "When did the Radiant King suspend the Sea of Stars?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and quickly replied, "Not long after the start of the Yong'an Calendar. At that time, the Radiant King suspended the Sea of Stars to please the Radiant Queen... It caused a huge commotion, and of course, it also served to intimidate the myriad races. That time, he lifted the entire ocean from the ground, suspending it in the air, stabilizing it for hundreds of thousands of years, which was astonishing..."

Of course, at that time, the Radiant King was at most a second-class power. However, suspending an ocean was more than enough.

Su Yu chuckled, "Interesting, at that time, the Culture King might have opened the heavens!"

Now he understood why no one could find the Culture King's world. Because the Culture King's world was too audacious, it was opened in the Allheaven Battlefield! Moreover, it was right under everyone's noses, because anyone who reached the Sunmoon Eternal Realm would inevitably come to the Allheaven Battlefield. Upon arriving, they would inevitably know about the Sea of Stars, and they couldn't possibly miss seeing it.

Given this, it meant that everyone in the Myriad Realms actually knew where the Culture King's world was!

Su Yu sighed, "What a brilliant move! Truly hiding in plain sight! Everyone knows about the Radiant King's suspension of the Sea of Stars, but the suspension itself wasn't of much use. Now I see, it seems to have helped the Culture King cover up the commotion of opening the heavens. After all, opening the heavens causes quite a stir..."

No wonder even the Human Emperor didn't know where the Culture King's world was opened.

Did the Radiant King himself know? Perhaps... he didn't! It was the Culture King who sneakily slipped his boot in while the Radiant King was suspending the Sea of Stars!

Su Yu chuckled, unable to resist saying, "Interesting, his boot, his world, hidden here, wasn't repelled!"

And were we all, when entering the Sea of Stars, actually swimming inside the Culture King's boot?

At this moment, the Sea of Stars only trembled for a while, revealing some semblance of a boot. But it hadn't fully appeared.

Su Yu laughed, quickly descending. The Culture King's shadow was about to dissipate, carrying a hint of pride, his laughter hearty, "The strong of the Myriad Realms are all beneath my feet, even the Human Emperor lives within my boot. Impressive, isn't it?"

Su Yu was stunned! After a while, he suddenly opened his mouth wide, indeed, the Luminous Domain Mansion... was also within the Sea of Stars!

This... he couldn't help but laugh, "Impressive!"

How strong was the Culture King? At this moment, he was genuinely curious.

Did the Human Emperor really not know? After all, the Human Emperor also lived in the Luminous Domain Mansion, and the Luminous Domain Mansion, now only two layers remained, was actually floating above the Sea of Stars. So, the entire Luminous Domain Mansion was actually built inside the Culture King's boot!

Of course, which came first, the Luminous Domain Mansion or the boot, wasn't necessary to pursue. It should have been the Luminous Domain Mansion first, and later the Culture King secretly slipped the boot in.

So, the Human Emperor had lived inside a boot for many years!

Su Yu laughed uncontrollably, "The Culture King is quite the trickster!"

The Great Zhou King had long rolled his eyes. The Culture King wasn't being mischievous; he was being bored!

He must have done it on purpose!

The strongest of the heavens, all in my shoe, smell my foot odor, isn't it delightful?

Whether others found it delightful, Su Yu didn't know, but he knew the Culture King must have found it very delightful!

After laughing for a while, Su Yu suddenly asked, "Is the Culture King stronger than the Human Emperor?"

He looked at the Great Zhou King, who hesitated for a moment, then shook his head, "I really don't know. At their level, unless they fight to the death, who knows who is stronger? However, in the eyes of the strong in the Myriad Realms, the Culture King's reputation is indeed greater than that of the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Perhaps the Culture King really is stronger, otherwise, how could the Human Emperor not have noticed anything? At that time, the Human Emperor hadn't opened the heavens yet... The Human Emperor's opening of the heavens was a later event, the Culture King should have been earlier!"

At this moment, the Culture King's shadow was about to completely dissipate, with a hint of sentiment, he said, "Occupying the territory of the River of Time is difficult! But I must do it! Successor of the pen dao, remember, my strength is beyond your imagination... But I can't exert my full strength because I'm suppressed by the River of Time... However, I must do this, to carve out a piece of territory in the Myriad Realms that belongs to us!"

"The Three Gates will open sooner or later, and both I and Xingyu want to carve out a pure land for the human race and for ourselves... He opened a barren land, that's admitting defeat, I don't admit defeat... I want to seize the territory of the Master of Time, hahaha!"

At this moment, the shadow suddenly became somewhat wild, laughing in a manner unbefitting a scholar.

However, Su Yu's heart was slightly shaken.

The Culture King... he did it on purpose!

He deliberately opened his world here!

This guy, what audacity, he wanted to seize the territory of the River of Time, to open a heaven within a heaven, to open a territory on the land of the Master of Time.

What was the purpose of doing this? What benefits did it bring?

Su Yu thought carefully, his heart stirred, the benefits were immense!

Whether it was the war of the Myriad Realms or the opening of the Three Gates, the strong of the Myriad Realms would soon gather in the Myriad Realms, and the gathering place would most likely be the Allheaven Battlefield, especially the Sea of Stars!

And the Sea of Stars... had been secretly seized by the Culture King!

In that case, once the strong of the Myriad Realms entered, it would be equivalent to entering the Culture King's territory.

Su Yu's thoughts flickered... interesting!

Was this a plan to catch them all in one net?

This was somewhat similar to his own idea of using the Tea Plant to attract others into his world and catch them all in one net!

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he gazed at the Sea of Stars. It had already returned to its tranquil state, as if the recent turmoil had been nothing but an illusion. The others seemed to have felt nothing significant.

Raising an eyebrow, Su Yu chuckled, "Impressive. Such a method... the power of this world far surpasses mine!"

Indeed, it was much stronger than his own. Su Yu couldn't achieve what the Culture King had done—biting off such a large territory within the domain of the River of Time!

The key lay in the unique position of this world. Even if powerful beings emerged from the Three Gates, their first choice would still be the Sea of Stars. As for the various realms or the Upper Realm, they weren't suitable. Although the Upper Realm was rich in source qi, it wasn't within the coverage of the River of Time. The Human Emperor's world was there, and now Su Yu's as well. If anyone were to emerge, they definitely wouldn't head to the Upper Realm or choose the Death Realm.

Instead, the Myriad Realms were the most suitable, with the Sea of Stars being the focal point!

Su Yu sighed in admiration. The Culture King was indeed formidable. Not only powerful, but years ago, he might not have initially targeted the Three Gates. However, from the start, he had certainly set his sights on the myriad races!

Yes, because the Luminous Domain Mansion was here!

So, the Culture King's initial goal might have been to encompass all the powerful beings of the myriad races!

Yet, he didn't activate it before leaving. Later, he must have prepared it to deal with the powerful beings from the Three Gates, because once activated, the myriad races would know that this place was his domain!

It was only now that Su Yu truly understood the methods and prowess of these ancient powerhouses.

Both the Culture King and the Human Emperor were scheming against the Three Gates!

The loss of control over the myriad races was merely due to too many unforeseen events.

Otherwise, with the Human Emperor's world occupying the Upper Realm and the Culture King occupying the Sea of Stars, if the powerful beings from the Three Gates emerged... they would inevitably enter one of their worlds, and at that time, they might be caught in a trap!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King watched as the Culture King's phantom dissipated and raised an eyebrow, "Your Majesty, does the Culture King mean that this place was prepared to deal with the people from the Three Gates?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "What a pity!"

He smiled, "If it weren't for the sudden incident with the Time Sage, even if the Three Gates opened, and the Human Emperor's world was fully established... those from the Three Gates would surely suffer a great loss at their hands!"

After speaking, Su Yu laughed, "No matter, we can continue. Besides us few, no one else knows about this! Let's first find the core of the world. The Culture King's power hasn't dissipated; it should still be in a restrained state! I'll go see just how strong his world is!"

...

Moments later.

Su Yu, following another boot, found the core of the world.

It seemed to be in another void, with a golden boot floating in the air, containing a powerful force. This was the core of the boot.

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he looked at the boot, vaguely seeing the power of over a thousand great daos!

His expression changed slightly, but he quickly smiled, "The Human Emperor... seems to have lost face!"

Among the openers, not only did the Master of the Undead walk a unique path, but the Human Emperor's world was definitely not as complete as the Culture King's, nor did it have as many dao laws!

"The Culture King might indeed be stronger than the Human Emperor!"

Su Yu sighed, feeling that the Human Emperor had lost face!

Meanwhile, the Great Zhou King and Tongtian couldn't care less about that. Both looked at the world, noting that the core area was actually quite small!

It seemed as if the entire world was within the range of that boot.

Yet, both could vaguely sense the terrifying power!

The Great Zhou King couldn't help but comment, "Truly patient. I think the Culture King's path of patience is strong. His world has almost never been used or exposed!"

If it had been exposed, the Culture King would have been even stronger during that period!

Su Yu laughed, not too concerned, because the Culture King's ambitions were vast, preparing for a massive trap. Before springing it, he was clearly unwilling to reveal it.

In this regard, he was quite similar to Su Yu. Didn't Su Yu leave without taking the Tea Plant?

He also wanted to set a trap!

However, it now seemed that even if he managed to trap someone, it wouldn't be as significant as the Culture King's plan. This one intended to wipe out countless powerful beings from the Three Gates in one go!
