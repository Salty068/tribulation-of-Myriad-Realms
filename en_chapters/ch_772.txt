Chapter 772: Return of the Hundred Battle King

Su Yu paid no heed to the reactions of others. At this moment, his primary focus was to find the Martial Emperor. It wasn't because the Martial Emperor was particularly handsome, but because Su Yu wanted to test his own strength and gauge his capabilities. In this era, only a few ancient beings could accurately assess their own power.

The Martial Emperor was evidently an ideal candidate for this. He was immensely powerful, having encountered numerous formidable opponents. Unlike the Hundred Battle King and others of his generation, who had never faced the rulers of laws or engaged with top-tier existences, the Martial Emperor had.

As for the Chaos Dragon, Su Yu had already roughly gauged its strength. Previously, he was no match for it, but now, if he were to face the Chaos Dragon again, the outcome might be different. Of course, the Chaos Dragon was injured, and Su Yu felt confident that he could take it down this time.

...

This time, Su Yu moved with incredible speed! In the blink of an eye, he tore through the void, and moments later, he arrived near the passageway on the seventh floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion, where the Martial Emperor connected to the Death Realm.

"Martial Emperor!" Su Yu's voice boomed like thunder. "An old friend has come to visit. Won't you come out and meet me?"

The Martial Emperor appeared swiftly, his figure manifesting at the entrance of the passageway in an instant. He looked at Su Yu with cold, sharp eyes.

"You've finally come!" the Martial Emperor said coldly, staring at Su Yu. "I've been waiting for you for a long time. I knew you would come back to finish me off. But where are your subordinates?"

As he thought this, he suddenly noticed a change in Su Yu's aura. "Your strength... seems different."

Though the Martial Emperor was sealed and this was merely a condensed avatar, his perception was limited. He could sense that Su Yu had grown stronger, but he couldn't accurately determine how much stronger.

Su Yu approached step by step, smiling. "Martial Emperor, tell me, how much of your strength have you recovered?"

"Enough to kill you!" the Martial Emperor snorted. Su Yu frowned slightly but quickly relaxed. "Such arrogance!"

With those words, Su Yu's hand covered the sky! A massive hand, infused with the power of myriad laws, gathered on his palm. The forces of life and death were particularly prominent, resembling a yin-yang symbol. With a single palm strike, he shattered the void and struck down!

This strike directly entered the seventh-floor passageway.

Boom!

The Martial Emperor's avatar did not retreat but instead punched out, resulting in a loud explosion.

With a bang, the avatar was directly slammed into the ground by Su Yu's palm, leaving a clear human-shaped imprint on the seventh-floor ground.

After delivering the palm strike, Su Yu walked through the air and stepped into the seventh floor.

Moments later, the Martial Emperor's avatar, slightly dizzy, flew out from the ground. He quickly regained his composure, transforming into a fierce demeanor. "You're courting death! Su Yu, how dare you ambush me!"

"..." Su Yu was speechless. Did I ambush you? Fine, if you say so.

"Martial Emperor, I'm going to fight you now!" Su Yu declared.

Before he could finish, the Martial Emperor punched at Su Yu. This avatar was quite powerful, not at the level of a Heavenly Sovereign, but definitely possessing the strength of a Heavenly King.

"Suppress!"

Su Yu's voice was low and commanding. "Suppress you, did you hear?"

Boom!

A great path emerged, like a giant mountain, descending invisibly. With a thunderous crash, the Martial Emperor's avatar swung his fist but hit nothing, being suppressed by the mountain!

Bang!

Another loud noise echoed as the Martial Emperor's avatar was firmly pinned at the location of the former King Gong's residence.

"Roar!"

The Martial Emperor roared furiously, causing the entire seventh floor to surge with winds and clouds. In an instant, a large amount of the power of laws surged into his avatar.

The Martial Emperor's avatar's strength surged instantly!

Boom!

He punched out again, this time much stronger than before. The punch shattered the suppressing mountain, and the Martial Emperor soared into the air, his expression grave. "How did you become so strong so quickly?"

His avatar wasn't weak before, yet it was instantly suppressed by Su Yu!

Su Yu's eyes gleamed with interest as he smiled. "Interesting. It seems you've unsealed quite a bit. Indeed, you can continue to strengthen! Enough talk, let me see your limits!"

Against the Martial Emperor's true form, Su Yu was undoubtedly no match. Among the rulers of laws, the Martial Emperor was not weak. However, how much of his strength could he unseal?

"Five Elemental Inferno!"

Su Yu's hand covered the sky, transforming into a cage. The power of the five elements merged, enveloping the Martial Emperor instantly.

The Martial Emperor was furious.

"Taishan Collapse!"

Once again, he punched out, and this time, an image appeared, as if in some era, he had punched and collapsed a giant mountain in chaos.

With this punch, the entire seventh floor was swept by fierce winds, cutting through the heavens and earth.

The fist imprint flew out, but as soon as it did, it was enveloped by the cage formed by Su Yu's Five Elemental Inferno. In an instant, the giant fist exploded within the cage, causing the Five Elemental Inferno to tremble violently.

However, it didn't break.

The Martial Emperor's expression changed again!

"Impossible!"

He looked at Su Yu, his face grim. "How could you progress so quickly? This isn't the power of the pen dao; it's the power of the Five Elemental Dao, the original power of the Five Elemental Ancestor... Have you walked the Five Elemental Path?"

Something was off!

On his avatar, a Heaven Gate faintly appeared. It wasn't too complete, as this was just an avatar, but it was enough to see the power of the great path.

He looked at Su Yu and instinctively glanced at the sky... and was stunned.

Where was the tributary of the great path?

Where was it?

Why wasn't it there?

He quickly looked down at Su Yu himself, and was stunned again, nearly blinded!

At this moment, Su Yu was like a Buddha, radiating brilliant light!

However, countless paths converged into one, and the connection point wasn't in the sky, but... behind him?

The Martial Emperor was initially dumbfounded, then seemed to realize something, his mouth agape, stammering, "You... you... your path... did you go to open a path?"

Was Su Yu just opening a path?

Seeing the Martial Emperor's Heaven Gate appear, Su Yu knew what he had seen and smiled. "Is it not allowed? Martial Emperor, come play with me. This avatar is too weak. Put in more effort, and I'll test my strength!"

The Martial Emperor's expression shifted, gritting his teeth. "You're courting death! You opened a path... and not within the River of Time. Your path is like a rootless duckweed! You actually went to chaos to open a path! Su Yu, you're insane, you're truly courting death!"

He hadn't seen Su Yu's path connected to the River of Time, but it seemed vaguely connected to chaos.

Wasn't this courting death?

A path like rootless duckweed, how long could it last?

Su Yu laughed. "Are you trying to say my endurance is lacking?"

Indeed, at this moment, Su Yu had a significant drawback.

Insufficient energy!

Normally, the path could slowly gather some chaotic power, convert it, and recharge.

However, Su Yu's path was limited in length, and the amount of power of laws it could contain was limited.

Once the battle dragged on and the power of laws was exhausted, Su Yu would quickly weaken.

The Martial Emperor said solemnly, "You're insane. Knowing this, you still went to chaos to open a path! A rootless duckweed, without the support of the River of Time's power, you'll become a complete waste after a prolonged battle!"

Su Yu laughed, "A summer insect cannot discuss ice! Do you think the energy of the Time Path is infinite? Was it always this abundant? The Time Path is also a separate path, drawing chaotic power and converting it into the power of myriad paths."

"Martial Emperor, it's a pity you opened the Heaven Gate, yet your knowledge is so limited... unimaginable!"

Su Yu laughed, "In battles between the strong, they often end in an instant. Even if my path isn't strong, with limited energy conversion and not much power of laws, it's enough for me to fight for an hour. What kind of formidable enemy would take me an hour to kill... I should have fled long ago!"

Drawbacks?

Su Yu didn't care!

Even if his cosmic path wasn't strong now, with energy conversion and full power, it was enough for Su Yu to fight at full strength for an hour.

If he encountered a formidable enemy and couldn't kill them in an hour, he would probably be killed by them.

Of course, if the strength was comparable, a prolonged battle wouldn't be favorable for Su Yu.

Moreover, if he had to escape and the opponent pursued relentlessly, it would also be a problem for Su Yu.

However, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks, and that was enough!

Without opening a path, he wouldn't reach this level of strength quickly.

Without opening a path, he would never surpass certain individuals.

At this moment, Su Yu was too lazy to talk much with the Martial Emperor. This guy had limited knowledge, or rather, he had a narrow mind. Even though he had opened the Heaven Gate and seen much, he was still guarding his own little territory.

His path, which Su Yu had seen before, wasn't even as strong as the pen dao, yet he clung to it stubbornly.

As someone who had opened the Heaven Gate, the Culture King had opened the heavens, the Human Emperor had opened the heavens, the Martial King was unclear, but Su Yu felt that even if they hadn't opened the heavens, they wouldn't be too weak.

In any case, they were definitely stronger than the Martial Emperor!

Of course, after over ten thousand years, the sealed Martial Emperor was likely falling further behind the normally cultivating Four Extremes Human Kings!

"Enough talk, come spar with me. I won't kill you!"

Su Yu chuckled lightly, too lazy to say more.

Drawbacks?

Letting you know my drawbacks, letting you know my endurance is lacking, so what?

"Mountain Break!"

A punch was thrown, causing mountains to crumble and the earth to split!

"Heaven Split!"

The fist transformed into a long blade, slicing through the heavens and earth.

The Martial Emperor's expression was grim. With a cold snort, he suddenly manifested a... large hammer?

It seemed to be a hammer!

Then, another appeared!

Dual hammers!

"Su Yu, don't think you're so strong!"

"Die!"

With the dual hammers in hand, the Martial Emperor's body expanded, the power of laws surged in, and he charged at Su Yu.

Boom!

The two clashed instantly. This time, Su Yu didn't use too many techniques, mainly employing fierce combat methods, using swords, spears, halberds, fists, and palms—all close-combat techniques.

Some auxiliary and binding techniques were too boring to use against the Martial Emperor.

If this guy couldn't break free, wouldn't it be impossible to fight?

After a brief exchange, Su Yu struck with a palm, intertwining the forces of life and death. At that moment, in the Martial Emperor's eyes, Su Yu appeared in alternating black and white. With a thunderous sound, the Martial Emperor was struck by the palm.

In an instant, his left side turned black, and his right side turned white.

Black and white alternated, and in the blink of an eye, the aura of death corroded the left side while vitality surged on the right. In an instant, half of the clone was eroded.

Su Yu struck him away with a palm, frowning. "This isn't right. Life and death should alternate. Logically, when I strike, you should explode from the clash of these two forces. But now, only the left side is corroded while the right side is brimming with vitality... This is very wrong!"

Indeed, my Great Dao is newly opened and still imperfect; I don't quite know how to utilize it.

At this moment, the Martial Emperor wore a yin-yang face, looking extremely displeased. Su Yu was using him as a test subject!

Gritting his teeth, the Martial Emperor let out a low roar. In the next moment, more power of laws gathered. Su Yu's eyes lit up with joy. "You can indeed draw more power of laws. I knew it! You old thing have unsealed quite a bit, always pretending that not much was unsealed!"

"Just as well. If you were too weak, killing you wouldn't be good for experimentation!"

Su Yu was delighted. The Martial Emperor was the perfect target! He could grow stronger at any moment. Although it was unclear how much he had unsealed, perhaps he could still forcibly draw a bit more?

"Life and Death!"

This time, Su Yu focused on the Dao of Life and Death, striking palm after palm. The Martial Emperor roared, wielding dual hammers, smashing toward Su Yu with a frenzy!

This time, he was much more ferocious!

He directly shattered the power of life and death!

Yet Su Yu was not alarmed; instead, he was pleased. "Try my power of the cosmos next!"

What nonsense?

Before the Martial Emperor could hammer Su Yu to death, suddenly, the world spun. In the next moment, it was as if he was in a chaotic world.

Su Yu, using this for the first time, laughed. "I'm not very skilled yet, but this counts as a shadow of the world I opened. I want to see if I can control everything here!"

"Die!"

Damn you, are you using me as a whetstone?

Dream on!

He charged at Su Yu with his hammers, but Su Yu was intrigued, smiling. "Retreat!"

The void spun, and although the Martial Emperor felt he was charging at Su Yu, he was actually getting further and further away.

Su Yu's eyes brightened. "How does it feel?"

The Martial Emperor was furious. "You bastard! Your Dao is too weak. If I were unsealed, this little Dao would be shattered with one hammer!"

He wasn't boasting.

If he were unsealed, this little bit of Dao power would have been shattered long ago.

Unfortunately... wasn't he sealed?

Su Yu also laughed. "No rush, I'll wait for you next time!"

With that, he continued experimenting. "Time acceleration!"

Yes, this time he began to accelerate.

This place is my world.

If I say time can accelerate, then it can accelerate. A surge of Dao power enveloped the Martial Emperor!

The Martial Emperor's clone began to age rapidly.

But soon, the Martial Emperor's body shook, roaring as he shattered the acceleration power. His rage was boundless. "Come, fight me with your body!"

Using these little tricks, what skill is that?

"One force to break all laws!"

He smashed the Dao power in front of him with a hammer, shattering Su Yu's retreat law and time law. The Martial Emperor's aura grew stronger as he charged at Su Yu with madness.

Su Yu's eyes shone brightly. Truly a good opponent, a good target, a good sparring partner!

"Power, attach to me!"

Su Yu shouted, and suddenly, a great force attached to him.

"Strengthen the body!"

The power of the body Dao surged in.

"Indestructible!"

Golden light flickered, and Su Yu's body suddenly became immensely powerful.

He punched out, using no other means. This punch collided head-on with the Martial Emperor's dual hammers. With a loud boom, the hammers shattered and exploded. Su Yu took a step back, but his eyes were bright as snow!

The Martial Emperor, having shattered his hammers, roared and kicked out!

One had to admit, this guy still had strength.

Boom!

Su Yu was kicked back continuously. In the next moment, Su Yu shouted, "Steady as a mountain!"

He rooted himself in place, unmoving.

"Petrify!"

He petrified himself instantly, not targeting the Martial Emperor.

"Rebound!"

A rebound force appeared on the stone.

The Martial Emperor's kick landed with a thud, sending him staggering back, his leg numb. Yet he gritted his teeth and charged again, throwing tens of thousands of punches, sending stone chips flying, scattering Su Yu's external rule power, and shattering his own hands!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's face was extremely ugly. He retreated a few steps, gritting his teeth. "If you have the guts, don't defend!"

Stone-man Su Yu opened his eyes, smiling. "No, I want to test my defense! Martial Emperor, it seems you can't break through!"

"Hmph!"

The Martial Emperor sneered. "One force to break all laws is no joke! It's just that my rule power is limited now, unable to counter your rule power, unable to break your Dao power!"

"True!"

Su Yu laughed. "So, those with weaker rule power than mine will find it hard to break my defense!"

With that, he laughed again. "Martial Emperor, let's try something else!"

"Bastard!"

The Martial Emperor wanted to break through the sky and leave this place, but Su Yu's expression changed. "Trying to leave? You old thing, come back here!"

The Martial Emperor ignored him!

Seeing this, Su Yu gritted his teeth. You want to run?

Dream on!

Continue being my sparring partner!

"Taunt!"

Yes, taunt.

As soon as this taunt Dao opened, Su Yu casually said a few words, and the Martial Emperor felt a surge of rage.

"Did Taishan beat you well? Does planting flowers on your butt feel good?"

"......"

Alright, with words like these, there was no need for any Dao power interference. The Martial Emperor was about to explode!

Did it even need taunting?

Boom!

He turned and charged at Su Yu. Damn it, if he didn't beat Su Yu to death today, he wouldn't be called the Martial Emperor!

The battle erupted once more.

At this time, Su Yu also began to slowly test his various Dao powers. Although he didn't want to bully the Martial Emperor's clone, it was... really satisfying, a good target, a good sparring partner!

"You are a pig!"

Su Yu shouted, using the Dao of Doubao to interfere with the opponent.

"Your whole family are pigs!"

The Martial Emperor roared madly, punching Su Yu back. Su Yu frowned slightly. "It's not working, this Dao is too weak!"

"Endure!"

Endurance Dao!

The Martial Emperor paused slightly. This Dao wasn't weak, but he quickly regained clarity.

He charged again, but halfway through, he suddenly turned and ran. To hell with you, I'm not fighting anymore, I can't take it!

"Reverse front and back!"

Direction reversed, and the Martial Emperor found himself flying toward Su Yu!

"Ah, you bastard, you beast, I'll kill you!"

His aura grew stronger, and he was going crazy!

This bastard had too many tricks.

He couldn't even run, so he decided to beat him to death!

Boom!

At this moment, Su Yu felt that the Martial Emperor was vaguely as strong as the Chaos Dragon. This level of unsealing wasn't low.

This time, many Dao powers were directly broken by him!

They couldn't affect the Martial Emperor!

One force to break all laws, indeed, for those with strong power, that's how it was. If the power was strong enough, any Dao power could be shattered with a punch!

But if the power wasn't strong enough... naturally, having more tricks was better.

"Imprison!"

"Chains!"

"Charm!"

"......"

Various Dao powers manifested.

"Cry for me!"

"Woo woo... damn your ancestors!"

The Martial Emperor did cry for a moment, then quickly cursed madly, charging at Su Yu again.

"Rage, furious rage!"

This time, the Martial Emperor didn't resist, his eyes blood-red with rage!

"Rage so intense, it clouds the mind!"

Su Yu chanted, and the Martial Emperor felt like countless flies were buzzing around his ears. Enraged, he began indiscriminate slaughter, the booming sounds shaking the surroundings!

Su Yu kept dodging, feeling that he might break the Martial Emperor's clone!

But... it was really satisfying!

Even the Chaos Dragon wasn't as fun to break, but the Martial Emperor's clone, after all, wasn't the true body, too easily affected by the Dao, too easy for Su Yu to see the effects of the Dao.

Su Yu was in a great mood.

Just as he was about to continue testing various Dao powers, the furious Martial Emperor seemed to have gone mad. Yet at this moment, a trace of clarity appeared in the depths of his eyes.

Gradually, his madness brought him closer to Su Yu.

It seemed like he was attacking indiscriminately!

It seemed like he was so angry he had lost his mind!

But... just as Su Yu was about to try another Dao power, the Martial Emperor's eyes suddenly cleared, and he roared, "To hell with you!"

Boom!

This punch was stronger than any before!

This punch shattered the world Su Yu was in, and with a loud boom, it landed on Su Yu, causing him to shatter into pieces, the world collapsing.

The Martial Emperor's clone also exhausted his strength, falling from the sky, breathing heavily, cursing; "Playing me for a fool! Did you really think I'm that stupid?"

Can't kill you!

And you got addicted to playing!

At this moment, Su Yu appeared out of thin air in the void, frowning slightly, his face a bit pale, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. He looked at the Martial Emperor, "You're something, if this wasn't just a clone, wouldn't I be dead by now?"

The Martial Emperor's clone sneered. "True body? Do you need my true body to deal with you? I'm only unsealed by twenty percent now. At thirty percent, I could kill you!"

"Blowhard!"

Su Yu laughed. "At thirty percent unsealed, you could kill me?"

"Blowhard?"

The Martial Emperor's clone stood up, swaying, sneering. "You're not weak, but your strength has only reached a critical point! You're slightly weaker than the weakest rule masters! Of course, you might be able to fight some of those ancient physical Dao human kings... but compared to me, you're far off!"

Su Yu frowned slightly, then nodded. "True! My strength is about the same as that Chaos Dragon from before. Strictly speaking, I'm on the same level as the Hundred Battle King from six thousand years ago, the ancestor of the Control King's lineage, the Chaos Dragon, and the Coronal Heavenly Venerable."

Last time he escaped, he had observed carefully.

He might be on par with that ancestor who appeared later, or perhaps slightly weaker.

But they were all in the same realm.

The kind that could fight Heavenly Venerables but couldn't defeat rule masters.

"But I have many tricks!"

Su Yu laughed, looking at the Martial Emperor's clone. "At the same level, with the same strength, they might not be able to beat me!"

Martial Emperor remained silent, cursing inwardly.

"Again!"

Su Yu approached once more, and the Martial Emperor roared in anger, "Get lost! Su Yu, what exactly do you want? If you have the guts, just kill my true body!"

"It's not like I can't kill you!" Su Yu chuckled softly, opening the Heaven Gate and looking up. "If you keep drawing on the power of laws, your seal will strengthen, but your strength will decline. You've reached a limit, haven't you? If I brought seven or eight Heavenly Kings, I could kill you today! Martial Emperor, serve as my sparring partner, and I won't kill you. Otherwise... I'll finish you off today!"

The Martial Emperor was going mad!

He roared furiously, "Fight, then let's fight for real! What's the point of using all those chaotic powers of the Great Dao? You can't kill me with them, are you just trying to disgust me?"

He was truly enraged!

He didn't fear fighting; he loved it. But Su Yu was too annoying, throwing all sorts of chaotic powers at him, like the Vomit Dao—damn it!

What kind of nonsense was this?

The Stench Dao was so foul that it made the Martial Emperor want to vomit; he couldn't stand it!

Su Yu smiled faintly, "Come on, let me test all the powers of the Great Dao. Once I'm done, I'll leave. Martial Emperor... do you want me to keep coming back endlessly?"

The Martial Emperor's face turned blue. The next moment, he shouted angrily, "Bring it on!"

Boom!

His aura surged again, charging at Su Yu. Today, he would fight him properly!

Did Su Yu really think he was just a paper tiger?

This time, the Martial Emperor didn't just punch and hammer. With the Heaven Gate open, he watched closely. Whenever Su Yu used some disgusting power of the Great Dao, he would instantly dodge and then return to attack!

With the Heaven Gate, one had to admit, this guy's combat experience was extremely rich!

...

An hour later, Su Yu buzzed and vanished into the void, escaping instantly.

He disappeared from the seventh level!

The Martial Emperor's phantom, bruised and battered, quickly returned to normal. He looked towards the passageway and snorted coldly, "No matter how many tricks you have, you can only fight for so long. If you don't run, I'll kill you!"

Su Yu's limitations were evident now.

The battle had reached this point, and he had to flee.

If he didn't, he would soon exhaust his power of laws.

The Martial Emperor cursed and swore, "Beast! If my true body is unsealed, the first thing I'll do is kill this beast!"

He was thoroughly disgusted!

Cursing, he turned back.

After resting for about half an hour, his expression suddenly changed, and he roared, "You're back again!"

Boom!

Su Yu ignored him. He had just gone to the Land of Chaos to speed up his recovery and had drawn a lot of chaotic power, converting it into the power of the Great Dao he needed.

About half an hour!

Of course, he was only bullying the Martial Emperor because he couldn't pursue him. Otherwise, he would have been killed countless times in half an hour!

But... wasn't the Martial Emperor unable to leave?

So, continue!

He desperately needed an indestructible opponent to hone his Great Dao.

At this moment, he needed combat experience against an opponent of this level.

Boom!

The entire seventh level erupted in battle again, shaking the heavens and the earth.

An hour later... Su Yu fled once more.

This time, the Martial Emperor cursed for a while, "Damn thing! I'll kill you eventually!"

"When I'm unsealed, the first thing I'll do is find you..."

The Martial Emperor cursed, wishing someone would kill Su Yu already.

So annoying!

He waited for a while, seeing that Su Yu hadn't returned, and breathed a sigh of relief. It had been half an hour, and Su Yu hadn't come back.

Just as he turned around... he was furious!

"You're back again?"

Why wasn't it half an hour yet?

And Su Yu, at this moment, explained excitedly, "You know, fighting with you, I've become more proficient with the power of the Great Dao. I feel like my Great Dao has expanded a bit, my comprehension has deepened, and my control has strengthened! I took a bit more time, so here I am again!"

Boom!

The Martial Emperor was going crazy, truly going crazy.

The battle erupted once more.

...

Another hour... and three more minutes.

This time, Su Yu lasted three more minutes before fleeing again.

The Martial Emperor stared blankly, too tired to even curse.

He just watched Su Yu leave with a blank expression.

After about 29 minutes, Su Yu returned excitedly, "The conversion speed has increased a bit, Martial Emperor, let's go again!"

Boom!

The battle resumed, and the Martial Emperor fought mechanically, punching, punching, punching!

This fight was disgusting!

...

One hour and five minutes.

Su Yu fled once more.

28 minutes later, he returned again.

The battle continued like this.

...

At this moment, the Great Zhou King and his group were already returning to the Abyssal Realm.

Soon, they arrived outside the Abyssal Realm.

Each of them looked towards the distant Luminous Domain Mansion.

The Great Zhou King felt a bit sympathetic, whispering, "Will the Martial Emperor self-destruct just to take him down with him?"

If I were the Martial Emperor... I really couldn't take it.

Su Yu kept coming back, tirelessly fighting for five or six hours. They had also waited in the Land of Chaos for a while, seeing Su Yu come and go, and didn't want to wait any longer, so they returned.

Wan Tiansheng sighed softly, "Martial Emperor... just wait! Emperor Yu is not someone who gives up easily. You can ask Bai Feng."

Beside him, Bai Feng rubbed his chin and said after a while, "This reminds me of the past. This guy... ahem, when Emperor Yu was cultivating, he could train for three to five days without sleeping to hone his martial skills!"

Su Yu's perseverance was unmatched.

When he first arrived at the Cultural Research Academy, he was weak, yet he trained until dawn every day, barely sleeping before going to class, training, competing, and earning money...

Compared to his peers, Su Yu's discipline and perseverance were beyond imagination.

No one succeeds easily. If the Martial Emperor thought Su Yu would stop after a while... he was mistaken.

Sure enough.

That day, the entire Death Realm felt it.

Su Yu kept flying back and forth!

Because Su Yu was excited, his endurance was increasing, and his recovery time was shortening.

From lasting one hour, he could now last an hour and a half.

And his recovery time had shortened to about 15 minutes.

He kept running back and forth, fighting back and forth. This time, he fought for three days!

Yes, three days, he fought the Martial Emperor.

He tried almost all the powers of the Great Dao.

...

Three days later.

Luminous Domain Mansion, seventh level.

The Martial Emperor's avatar, eyes dull, seemed wooden.

When he saw Su Yu return once more, he laughed, a silly laugh, with a hint of foolishness.

"You're back?"

Su Yu was stunned. Did I beat him silly?

"Heh heh!"

"Heh heh!"

The Martial Emperor chuckled, and just as Su Yu was about to speak, there was a loud explosion, and the avatar shattered!

The Martial Emperor's voice echoed, "Heh heh, I've sealed myself. Continue if you want! Heh heh!"

I'm done!

He blew up this avatar to end it!

Su Yu was taken aback, and after a while, he said, "I... I think I'm almost done. If I keep fighting, I probably won't gain much more. I came this time to say goodbye to the Martial Emperor. I still have many things to do and can't keep fighting you... I'm not a battle maniac!"

What a strange guy!

Why blow up your avatar?

It takes a toll and time to create another one.

You lasted three days, couldn't you listen to me for a moment?

What a fool!

The Martial Emperor remained endlessly silent.

Su Yu didn't mind, smiling, "Thank you, Martial Emperor. These three days, I was very happy!"

"I'll come again when I have time..."

After saying this, Su Yu laughed and stepped into the air, leaving.

Once he was gone, the Martial Emperor's voice suddenly turned frantic.

On the first level, a giant eye opened!

A mouth opened wide, and suddenly, a roar erupted, "Su Yu, you won't die a good death! When I'm unsealed, I'll spend three days and nights killing you!"

Yes, three days and nights!

Su Yu had fought him for three days and nights, and he wanted to return the favor!

The Luminous Domain Mansion shook!

It shook violently!

The Martial Emperor wished he could crawl out right now and kill that guy.

He was furious!

Fighting for three days and nights wasn't enough. In the end, he thought he had won, that he wouldn't fight anymore, blew up his avatar, and told Su Yu to play by himself.

In the end, Su Yu told him he was here to say goodbye.

Ahhh!

The Martial Emperor was going crazy. He wanted to see Su Yu go crazy, see Su Yu angry, see Su Yu furious, not Su Yu looking at him like he was a fool.

"Bastard!"

"Go to hell!"

The Martial Emperor was hysterical, and the mansion kept shaking. At this moment, his roar seemed to echo across the Myriad Realms.

...

At the same time.

Soul Burying Mountain.

Hundred Battle decided it was time to descend with his people.

The winds in the realm passage were dangerous, but Hundred Battle was powerful. This wasn't the passage of the Fate Clan, and descending with strength was still feasible.

Moments later, a group arrived in the endless void.

In the past few days, the battle in the Upper Realm had ended.

With some ancient beasts returning from the depths of Chaos... especially with a few incredibly powerful ancient beasts emerging, the battle in the Upper Realm ended prematurely.

Because everyone was wary!

From the depths of Chaos, a tiger and a dragon had emerged, both incredibly powerful, causing the Upper Realm battle to end early.

Everyone was cautious!

The depths of Chaos had unexpectedly produced powerful ancient beasts, and as for the previous giant bird, it hadn't been seen, its fate unknown.

Hundred Battle appeared in the endless void, sensing the aura, and smiled, "I'm back!"

The Myriad Realms!

After six thousand years away, he had returned!

"Your Majesty, where to now?"

"First to the Human Realm, then to the Giant Realm!"

Hundred Battle smiled, "Let's see how the Human Realm is now, and see what Su Yu left for me after he left."

He led a few people, stepping into the air towards the Human Realm.

He walked slowly, wanting to see what the Myriad Realms were like now.

As he walked, he suddenly turned his head towards a direction, raised his eyebrows slightly, and smiled, "Heavenly Overseer Marquis, it's been a long time!"

In the distance, the figure of the Heavenly Overseer Marquis appeared, looking at him with a smile.

"Hundred Battle... you're back!"

The Hundred Battle King looked at him, chuckling, "I'm back. Interested in joining me?"

"Heh... no thanks!"

"How bold!"

Marquis Nanxi let out a low shout. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis glanced at him, then at Marquis Yunshui and Marquis Jiang Hai, with a bright smile. "Gentlemen... I can't speak for others, but Yunshui... I'm afraid things won't end well for you!"

With a light chuckle, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's figure dissipated. "Hundred Battle King, I know all about the past! Unfortunately... you probably don't dare to kill me now, and perhaps you won't even get the chance! Hahaha!"

His figure completely vanished.

The Hundred Battle King watched his retreating figure for a long time before softly saying, "Interesting... The fortunes of the ancient times seem to be reviving once more!"

Murmuring to himself, the Hundred Battle King soon stopped paying attention. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis was not someone he could deal with at the moment. Killing him now would only invite trouble.

Currently, the situation in the Giant Realm was uncertain. Killing the Heavenly Overseer Marquis now might lead to the emergence of a large number of rulers in the Upper Realm, which would be a real headache!

Beside him, Marquis Yunshui frowned slightly.

Without turning his head, the Hundred Battle King said, "He must be referring to Su Yu. Don't worry, I'll handle it!"

The Hundred Battle King chuckled lightly. "It seems the Heavenly Overseer Marquis believes Su Yu can still accomplish something, and... it looks like he has quite the vengeful spirit. Yunshui, be careful."

"Your Majesty, I..."

"It's fine, fortune isn't everything! Luck doesn't mean much; otherwise, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis would have unified the world long ago!"

Since the Heavenly Overseer Marquis said so, he must have seen something, perhaps that Marquis Yunshui's fortunes were unfavorable. However, the Hundred Battle King didn't fully believe in such things.

No emperor would completely trust in fortune!

Of course, a little caution was still necessary, as the Heavenly Overseer Marquis was a top-tier expert in observing fortunes.
