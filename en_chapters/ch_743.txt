Chapter 743: A Favor Returned

"Hehehe..."

A suppressed laugh escaped from Su Yu's throat. Was it a risky move just now? Extremely risky! For the first time, he had revealed his true form in front of two opposing Heavenly Sovereigns. This was a monumental life-and-death test for him.

Ever since his strength had surged and he had gained control over numerous powerful beings, Su Yu rarely took such risks. The last time he had launched a surprise attack on Sealing Mountain, he had been confident of success. But this time, if the two Heavenly Sovereigns turned hostile and summoned others, temporarily abandoning their search of the Upper Realm and the blockade of Chaos Mountain, Su Yu's chances of escaping would be slim.

Moments later, Lantian arrived. At that moment, Lantian was also filled with lingering fear. Seeing Su Yu, he exhaled and said, "That was too risky!"

Su Yu's smile was radiant. "But... the rewards will be great, won't they?"

"Will they cooperate?" Lantian's eyes were uncertain. "Won't they turn against each other soon?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Before they resolve the issue of those pseudo-dao experts, they won't rashly turn on each other. Even without a Heavenly Sovereign, with five or six Heavenly Kings and nearly a hundred Daofuse experts, do you think they would risk it without being certain they could suppress us?"

That was the crux of the matter!

Su Yu's smile was bright. "Besides, rather than fighting both sides at once, why not join forces to take down one side? We want to cooperate with them; do you think they don't want to cooperate with us? If Chaos Mountain approaches them to eliminate us first, do you think the myriad races would agree?"

Su Yu laughed lightly, "The current situation for the myriad races is that they might agree to cooperate with anyone who approaches them. They just need to be cautious. But for us, on the Chaos Mountain side, every death is one less ally, one less strength!"

Lantian nodded. "They will definitely guard against us! And they will also look for ways to solve the issue of pseudo-dao control, perhaps even gradually transitioning people to cultivate true dao to free themselves from our control!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling. The myriad races would certainly try to solve these problems. They wouldn't allow so many powerful beings to remain under Su Yu's control. That would be too dangerous!

As for killing all these powerful beings at once... the myriad races wouldn't do that either. The losses would be too great, and if exposed, even true dao experts would feel a sense of impending doom. After all, many people, including those from the three major races, had numerous pseudo-dao experts among them. Whether friends, family, or even father and son, it wasn't so simple to just kill them off.

Su Yu smiled and said, "There's another possibility!"

Lantian looked at him, and Su Yu chuckled, "They might find us and collaborate with Chaos Mountain to eliminate us! Because we are the threat controlling the pseudo-dao. Even if they don't know exactly who can control them, they know that back in the day, none of them could handle the Armory... so maybe only a few of us can."

"I count as one, and if we include the Great Zhou King, that's another..."

Su Yu laughed, "So, the myriad races definitely have the intention to kill us! If we die, the pseudo-dao... wouldn't that become true dao?"

Cooperating is like negotiating with a tiger! One must be cautious at every turn!

Of course, if the cooperation is successful, at least on the surface, both sides can get along. What happens in the shadows is another matter. Currently, all three parties harbor ulterior motives, forming alliances purely for profit. No one truly treats the other as an ally. To genuinely give one's heart would be a path to destruction!

Su Yu took a deep breath and continued, "As long as the Control King's lineage shows some strength, this alliance can temporarily stabilize! If the Control King's lineage is too weak, then this alliance cannot be stabilized!"

Lantian chuckled, "What if the Control King's lineage pretends to be weak?"

"That's not so easy!"

Su Yu smiled, "Having just emerged, facing their first battle in ten thousand years, if they pretend to be weak, aren't they afraid their morale will collapse? Even if morale doesn't collapse, if the myriad races push all the way to their lair, it will come at a cost. The Chaos Mountain lineage is more likely to prevent the myriad races from breaking through that primeval forest and entering the inner perimeter!"

Lantian nodded again.

The two exchanged glances, both showing faint smiles.

This might be a turning point.

The enmity between the two sides was as deep as the sea. The myriad races had killed countless human experts, and Su Yu's side was no different. But when a stronger force emerged, a weak alliance became inevitable.

Su Yu weighed the pros and cons. Overall, cooperation offered more benefits than drawbacks!

"Emperor Yu, what do we do now?"

Su Yu probably wouldn't return to the Source of the Dao.

Su Yu smiled, "Now? Now we head back to the Iron Devourer Race. Have you forgotten? We are still Daofuse experts of the Iron Devourer Race. We're supposed to go to the Myriad Races Mountain soon. If we don't go, won't that raise suspicions?"

Lantian laughed.

"And if the myriad races really hand over humans to us..."

Su Yu said calmly, "It's fine. Even if the myriad races send them over, we can't trust them immediately. We'll detain them and wait for the right moment."

Su Yu had no intention of subduing anyone right now. That wasn't realistic, and it was too dangerous. Currently, there couldn't be any internal problems. As the weakest of the three parties, internal issues would make the upcoming battles unmanageable.

After speaking, Su Yu thought of something and suddenly released someone.

The Extermination King emerged, looking aggrieved.

I'm just a tool now! Whenever they need my blood, they pull me out for a bit. It's disheartening.

Su Yu smiled, "Extermination King, it was all for our grand plan. If you contribute more now, you'll achieve great success in the future and enter the Daofuse Realm sooner!"

"..."

The Extermination King felt weary and said with resentment, "Next time, give me a heads-up."

Su Yu laughed, nodded, and asked, "How is Wen Qi?"

"I've beaten him up a few times!"

Wen Qi had been suppressed, and although the Extermination King hadn't reached the Daofuse Realm, he could still handle him.

He continued, "I don't know if he's afraid of being monitored by you, but when I suggested he join the Control King's lineage, he ignored me. It's hard to say if he has any intention of betrayal... but for now, it seems he hasn't betrayed us."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Then hand him over to Hundred Battle. Hundred Battle and Moon Luo have entered the inner perimeter of Chaos Mountain. It's dangerous there... never mind, let's wait a few days and see."

A strategist like Wen Qi could be useful, but Su Yu didn't want to bother suppressing him now. It was too troublesome. Better to let him be Hundred Battle's strategist!

...

Soon, Su Yu and Lantian headed in the direction of the migrating Iron Devourer Race.

As for the skull, they would deal with it once they reached the Iron Devourer Race.

...

At the same time.

Source of the Dao.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign and Mo Heavenly Sovereign had returned, and Six Wings had been suppressed by them. After all, Six Wings had killed many strong experts of the God Race before. Regardless, they had to show an attitude now by suppressing Six Wings, rather than letting him appear openly.

Next time Six Wings appeared, it would be best if he had a new identity to avoid inciting the friends and family of those slain experts.

The two returned to their original location. At this moment, Mo Heavenly Sovereign sent a voice transmission, asking, "Should we discuss this with everyone? If we do, should March and the others be involved?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign replied via voice transmission, "We should discuss it... it's best to talk it over! As for March and the others... of course, they should be involved. If they have any cooperation with the Torchbearer lineage, they would know the situation even if we don't invite them! If they don't, we can take this opportunity to probe their intentions! We know a bit about March's intentions, but we don't know the specifics about Thunderstorm and Destiny."

"Especially Thunderstorm... is there a marriage alliance between Hundred Battle and Thunderstorm? Why don't we know about it?"

Upon hearing this, Mo Heavenly Sovereign also felt frustrated and quickly sent a voice transmission, "Probably not many people know about this. When Hundred Battle had an incident back then, Thunderstorm didn't get involved. When he was unsealed earlier, Thunderstorm didn't interfere either... not sure if he's hiding deeply or waiting for the right moment to act!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign didn't say much more and quickly said, "Let's continue the sweep. Have Nether Heavenly Sovereign, Dao Heavenly Sovereign, and Demon Heavenly Sovereign send avatars to come early and discuss this matter clearly. Whether it's cooperation or besieging the Torchbearer lineage, a decision should be made! It concerns hundreds of pseudo-dao experts and cannot be taken lightly!"

Mo Heavenly Sovereign was silent for a moment and then sent a voice transmission, "How do you think they control the pseudo-dao? Is it arbitrary control, or does it require specific conditions?"

Both Bone Wing Marquis and Six Wings had issues after erupting, and before that, they hadn't connected to the power of the Great Dao. Perhaps during that period, the other side had seized a flaw.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign wasn't too concerned about this and said directly, "Regardless of whether there are specific conditions, have you forgotten how the six quasi-kings died before?"

That wasn't due to specific conditions, right?

The other side might not be able to control them, but suppression was definitely possible, and it didn't require any conditions!

On that day, six quasi-kings were easily killed and instantly suppressed. On that day, Demon Heaven was there, and there was some sense of it. They also sensed some of it from afar.

"Moreover, if the Chaos lineage is as strong as they claim... at this moment, joining forces with these guys to weaken the Chaos lineage is also the outcome we hope for! Mo Heavenly Sovereign, do you think... does this lineage really have a master of rules?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign asked a question that everyone had been avoiding.

Do they really exist?

It's hard to say!

There's a possibility, but if one truly appears, even a weak one might be difficult for three to five Heavenly Sovereigns to match!

Heavenly Sovereigns are already the limit of this era!

Mo Heavenly Sovereign was also silent, unsure if there was one. Some things Su Yu said weren't baseless. He mentioned that the Chaos Dao wasn't restricted, which was highly likely.

Mo Heavenly Sovereign thought of this and sent a voice transmission, "They come from the Lower Realm, and now... it might not be easy for the Lower Realm!"

"Jiwu is still alive."

"Demon Halberd is also still alive."

The two exchanged a glance across the void, saying no more. The Lower Realm was difficult to reach, and perhaps... perhaps this cooperation could also discuss something else, like opening the passage to the Lower Realm?

Even if the Torchbearer lineage doesn't agree, at least they should agree to some conditions, like... allowing Jiwu and the others to come to the Upper Realm!

Yes!

At this moment, they knew that the Lower Realm might be hard to hold onto!

But Jiwu and the others didn't die; that much was true. Whether it was Jiwu, Tiangu, or even Demon Halberd, these top-tier Daofuse combatants had been residing in the lower realm for countless years. If they ascended to the Upper Realm, their strength might advance further! Alternatively, they could find a way to break the passage from the lower realm, stripping the Torchbearer lineage of its greatest protection! Cooperation didn't mean friendship; they were still rivals.

As these thoughts surfaced, the two began transmitting messages to the three major leaders of Chaos Mountain, inviting them to send avatars to discuss important matters. Meanwhile, March and the others were puzzled by their return but refrained from asking questions when they remained silent. The group continued their busy search of the Source of the Dao, now more cautious after the incident with Six Wings.

...

By the fourth night, they had returned to the migrating Iron Devourer Race. The Iron Devourers hadn't migrated by storing people in weapon spaces; instead, over ten thousand Iron Devourer Beasts carried multiple mountains as they journeyed toward Ren Mountain. Indeed, the Iron Devourer Race moved mountains as they traveled! They uprooted bamboo-covered mountains, intending to transplant them to Ren Mountain, fearing the new location might not be suitable for bamboo growth. The smaller Iron Devourer Beasts frolicked on the mountains, showing no signs of homesickness. The larger ones seemed indifferent, treating it as a long journey.

Atop the largest mountain, the grand bamboo hall of the Iron Devourer Race, crafted by Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others, had been relocated, now resting on the mountain.

...

At this moment, both Marquis Giant Bamboo and April were present among the Iron Devourer Race. Seeing Su Yu and Lantian return, they both sighed in relief. Marquis Giant Bamboo quickly asked, "Earlier at the Source of the Dao, many powerful beings perished. Was it Emperor Yu's doing?"

Su Yu chuckled, "It was a coincidence. I took the opportunity to eliminate a few."

Marquis Giant Bamboo couldn't even muster a smile, feeling a lingering fear. "There are many Heavenly Sovereigns there. Emperor Yu must be cautious! It's too dangerous!"

Having pledged allegiance to Su Yu, they were invested in his future. Su Yu taking risks was not the outcome they wanted to see.

Su Yu smiled, "Don't worry, I'll be careful. But right now, it's impossible to avoid all risks. We're not at that stage yet. High risk, high reward!"

After speaking, Su Yu exhaled and added, "Perhaps things will get a bit easier from now on."

Without dwelling on the topic, Su Yu quickly asked, "While we were away, did anyone come to investigate?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo laughed, "They didn't dare. I was here. However, there were some urging us to hurry. Marquis Yuan Sheng sent someone over, saying we were too slow. Most races have already arrived, and we're only halfway there."

Though they were given ten days, it shouldn't have taken this long under normal circumstances. The Iron Devourer Race was moving too leisurely!

"Ignore them!"

Su Yu chuckled and didn't say more. Soon, he released a skeleton.

Qi Rong was vigilant, scanning the area as soon as she emerged. She was slightly startled—Iron Devourer Race! She seemed to recognize Marquis Giant Bamboo, her clear gaze instantly locking onto him. However, Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't recognize her, looking puzzled. "A member of the Skeleton Race?"

"…"

Su Yu laughed, "No, she's human. She's just been in seclusion for too long, nearly perishing!"

He continued with a smile, "Marquis Giant Bamboo, do you recognize her? Qi Rong, a woman."

Beside him, Lantian paused, glanced at Qi Rong, smiled, and said nothing.

Marquis Giant Bamboo didn't care about gender, thought for a moment, and shook his large head, not recognizing her.

April also looked at Qi Rong, puzzled, "Qi Rong… never heard of her!"

Qi Rong, looking at them, remained silent.

Su Yu chuckled, "A strong individual capable of cultivating a pseudo-path to the Heavenly King Realm wouldn't be an unknown figure. Qi Rong, it seems you aren't very famous."

"I've always worked behind the scenes…"

Su Yu laughed, "Alright, let's not dwell on this. I'm not interested in your true identity!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Didn't you want to meet the current highest leader of the Human Race? I'm in the Upper Realm now and can't return to the Human Realm. Let's do it here. Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others are present to serve as witnesses."

Upon hearing this, Qi Rong understood his intention. After a moment of silence, she asked, "Are you the current Human Lord?"

Su Yu smiled, nodded slightly, and without further ado, first took out the Starry Sky Seal, pressing it toward her. Qi Rong's bones creaked under the pressure. Su Yu said calmly, "The Human Emperor's Starry Sky Seal, used before unifying the Myriad Realms. Do you recognize it?"

A look of horror appeared in Qi Rong's eyes. After a long while, she nodded slightly, "I've heard of it. No wonder… you could control those pseudo-path experts at the Source of the Dao. Is it because of this?"

Su Yu smiled, "Perhaps!"

As he spoke, he opened the Heaven Gate, looking at her. Qi Rong's expression turned to horror once more. "You… opened the Heaven Gate?"

"Yes."

Su Yu said calmly, "Is this enough? If not, we can wait until I return to the lower realm and visit the Human Realm."

Qi Rong sighed softly, bowed slightly, and said, "Qi Rong believes it. With the Starry Sky Seal and Heaven Gate, even if there are other Human Lords, you are undoubtedly the heir to the Human Emperor…"

Su Yu smiled, "Not really. I haven't inherited anything from the Human Emperor."

He didn't elaborate, looking at Qi Rong. "Earlier, you said you had something to discuss with the highest leader of the Human Race. Let's hear it now."

Qi Rong was silent for a moment before speaking, "Allow me to introduce myself. My real name is indeed Qi Rong… but I have an official title…"

Everyone looked at her, intrigued by her mysteriousness. They had encountered several ancient marquises before. Who exactly was she?

Qi Rong took a deep breath, "I am from the Third Tide, conferred as Consort Qi by Human Lord Yue Gang!"

"…"

Everyone exchanged glances. Marquis Giant Bamboo's eyes widened, and after a long pause, he said, "You… are Consort Qi?"

His eyes widened.

Seeing Su Yu and the others looking at him, he quickly explained, "During the Third Tide, the leader of the Human Race was Yue Gang. The Human Lord was considered on par with the Human King… Consort Qi was Yue Gang's partner. But… but Consort Qi was said to have perished long ago. You…"

Qi Rong's voice was hoarse, with a hint of self-mockery, "I didn't. I was always working behind the scenes. Later, I encountered some issues with my cultivation, so… I went into seclusion! Since everyone thought I was dead, I went into seclusion quietly. Only Yue Gang knew where I was."

She spoke with some emotion, sighing, "Yue Gang… has fallen."

Dead!

The first thing she asked Su Yu was about Human Lord Yue Gang.

And Su Yu's answer was that he had fallen.

That was her partner, the Human Lord. She hadn't been able to see him before his death. She knew Yue Gang might have died suddenly or didn't have time to see her one last time.

A hint of sorrow appeared on her skull, quickly fading. She said softly, "Qi Rong greets the current Human Lord!"

She bowed again, and this time Su Yu returned the gesture, "I apologize for the neglect, Your Highness!"

Su Yu was somewhat curious. It was his first time meeting the consort of a powerful figure… no, he had also met the former empress of the God Emperor.

Marquis Giant Bamboo, however, seemed to have thought of something, his expression changing suddenly. Not only him, but April also seemed to have realized something, exclaiming, "You… you faked your death?"

Qi Rong nodded slightly.

April was shocked, "No, back then… weren't you… weren't you executed? How did you fake your death?"

"…"

Su Yu was stunned. Executed?

What nonsense?

Marquis Giant Bamboo's expression also changed rapidly. He quickly said, "Consort Qi was said to have been executed by the Human Race for treason, right? Yue Gang personally ordered it. This caused quite a stir back then. She was the first consort to be executed in many years…"

"Treason?"

Qi Rong's voice was hoarse, with a hint of self-mockery, "Why would I betray? My husband was the Human Lord, the highest-ranking figure in the Human Race. Did I need to betray? If someone wants to frame you, they'll find a reason! The Human Lord… was just a puppet! I simply didn't want Yue Gang to be a puppet, to be feared by others. In the end, this was the result… Fortunately, my husband, though stubborn, knew I meant well… and secretly saved me! However, my Great Dao was indeed severed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have cultivated a pseudo-path."

Su Yu frowned slightly. What a scandal!

But it didn't seem like a happy one.

Su Yu said softly, "Consort Qi, you mean you were accused of treason and executed by the Human Race? Yue Gang personally ordered it, severed your Great Dao, and then secretly saved you, connecting you to a pseudo-path?"

"The Human Lord is correct."

Qi Rong sighed, "Time has passed, and there's nothing more to say. I see the Human Lord has no ancient figures by his side. Perhaps the disappearance of the old era is a good thing. At least… there won't be any more puppets!"

As for Marquis Giant Bamboo, being an outsider, she spoke more freely, seeing that Su Yu had no ancient human experts by his side.

Su Yu, however, smiled, "A puppet… you mean Yue Gang of the Third Tide was heavily restricted?"

Qi Rong mocked herself, "Restricted? At that time, Yue Gang was… just a warrior! In any dangerous battle, he was at the forefront! Those people claimed to be nurturing a Human Lord, but in reality, they were cultivating warriors, not true Human Lords! Because they were all loyal to the Human Emperor, waiting for his return. Until then, they wouldn't allow anyone else to have the chance to replace the Human Emperor…"

Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled, "Interesting. It seems Hundred Battle was in a similar situation, though at least he was strong enough. Yue Gang… how strong was he?"

"About the same as the Human Lord."

That meant he had just stepped into the quasi-king realm. With such strength, he indeed couldn't control the Human Race during that period.

During that era, the Human Race had too many ancient figures, numerous quasi-kings, and even Heavenly Sovereigns.

"Were you wrongfully killed?" Su Yu asked.

Qi Rong was silent for a moment before replying, "Not exactly. They accused me of betrayal... and to be honest, they weren't entirely wrong."

Su Yu frowned. Just a moment ago, she claimed she was wronged, and now she admits to some guilt. Isn't that contradictory?

The Consort of King Qi spoke calmly, "Let's put it this way: back then, I was unwilling to let Yue Gang become their pawn. I secretly did some things, like encouraging the cultivation of pseudo-paths, trying to find ways for Yue Gang to advance further, and even having him seize opportunities to execute a group of powerful humans as a warning to others..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Did you do it? And then you got caught?"

"More or less."

Qi Rong sighed, "In the end, we were too weak. There were too many spies around us, even among those I thought were loyal. They were actually planted by those old guys!"

She continued helplessly, "Later, when the plan was exposed, those old guys were furious and wanted to kill me! Yue Gang pleaded for me, but it was useless. In the end, Yue Gang had to personally order my execution... he even did it himself!"

Qi Rong laughed, "Isn't it pathetic? The Human Lord... couldn't even protect his own partner."

She sighed again, "So when Yue Gang died in battle, I wasn't surprised. Those who act as pawns never live long! When I saw the Human Lord, I asked if Yue Gang was still around, but it was just a sliver of hope. He never came to see me all these years, so he must have perished long ago!"

Nearby, April spoke gloomily, "Yue Gang died long ago, tens of thousands of years ago! During the Third Tide, a great battle erupted, and May's son, my grandson, died in that tide change."

Su Yu recalled this matter. Not only that, but he also thought of many other things and said, "The Third Tide indeed had many upheavals. May's descendants perished, the Torchbearer officially appeared, and according to the Great Zhou King, the Weapon Cave emerged during the Third Tide. After the Third Tide ended, the Torchbearer's path was abandoned. Many things happened, so indeed, the Third Tide was tumultuous."

Marquis Giant Bamboo nodded, "Yes, Yue Gang was a fierce general! After Consort Qi was executed, Yue Gang lay low for some years. Later, he led some ancient marquises and initiated the battle that ended the Third Tide. In that battle, dozens of Daofuse Realm cultivators died! Many ancient marquises perished, and the myriad races suffered heavy losses. Yue Gang died in battle..."

Below, Qi Rong's eyes showed a hint of bitterness. She quickly said, "He must have been prepared. I knew he would do this... he would eventually confront those ancient marquises. It's just a pity... he still couldn't turn the tide!"

Su Yu laughed, "It seems being the Human Lord is a dangerous job, always ending in death! Indeed, out of nine Human Lords, only the Hundred Battle King is still alive; the rest are dead! Every tide change ends with the death of a Human Lord... it's quite tragic!"

The death of a Human Lord marked the end of a tide. Until the Hundred Battle King, who was so powerful that this curse was broken, though even he was sealed for six thousand years.

Su Yu laughed, "Being the Human Lord is a deadly position. Many ancient marquises are still alive, but a bunch of Human Lords have died. Truly pitiful!"

It's hard to say what's right or wrong. The Human Lord was originally cultivated by ancient powerhouses, and the first nine generations were all like that!

No, the first generation wasn't. The son of the Martial King was a reckless man who got himself killed. Otherwise, there might not have been subsequent Human Lords, as the Martial King still had many powerful subordinates.

Su Yu laughed again, "Fortunately, in my era, the old guys are all gone. Those who aren't are in the Upper Realm. I haven't eaten their food or drunk their wine, so I don't have to care about their opinions!"

Qi Rong sighed softly, "I can sense that. Otherwise... the Human Lord shouldn't have sealed me right from the start. The Human Lord's attitude towards me made me feel that perhaps... the old powerhouses aren't very favored by the Human Lord!"

Indeed, she dared to reveal her identity to Su Yu because she had already guessed some things, including Su Yu's identity.

She was a smart person, and Su Yu's attitude towards her made her feel that this Human Lord's attitude towards those ancient powerhouses was just so-so.

When Su Yu mentioned that Marquis Dingjun was still alive, Qi Rong cursed him as useless, and Su Yu didn't even bother to refute. If he was inclined towards them or under their control, he wouldn't have shown such an expression, even if he didn't refute.

Despite just being revived, Qi Rong quickly guessed some things through observation.

At this moment, she saw Su Yu sitting while Marquis Giant Bamboo and Lantian, both quasi-kings, stood, as did April. In the entire hall, only Su Yu was sitting, looking relaxed. This wasn't something an ordinary Human Lord could achieve.

During the Third Tide, it was usually the old powerhouses who sat while Yue Gang stood and discussed matters with them. That was the difference.

Hearing Qi Rong's words, Su Yu laughed, "Consort Qi, don't try to sow discord. I still have many ancient powerhouses on my side, like Marquis Dingjun, Marquis Huoyun, and Marquis Shadow. I respect these elders very much!"

"Hehehe..."

Su Yu glared at Lantian, who let out a strange laugh. Lantian chuckled dryly and stopped laughing.

Do you really respect them?

Alright, let's pretend I didn't hear that.

Even Marquis Giant Bamboo had a peculiar expression. Respect, my foot!

Saying that without blushing?

Those old powerhouses have no face in front of Su Yu. The ones with some face are actually from other races. Among the Human Race, Su Yu suppresses them heavily.

Qi Rong couldn't help but glance at a few people and softly said, "The Human Lord... seems to have completely controlled the situation?"

Su Yu laughed, "Thanks to the Hundred Battle King, the ninth-generation Human Lord, who ruined the Human Race. The old powerful ones are all dead, and the remaining ones aren't much. I have strength and confidence, so I don't have to be afraid. Of course, I'm kind-hearted. After all, they are seniors, and I respect them very much!"

"Heh..."

Su Yu's eyes widened, and Lantian shut his mouth. Su Yu was a bit annoyed, "Get out!"

Lantian was helpless. I really couldn't hold it in.

You lie through your teeth to everyone!

Qi Rong was also speechless. When Su Yu said that, even Marquis Giant Bamboo's eyes darkened, clearly unable to bear looking directly.

Qi Rong roughly guessed and didn't say much more. She didn't give Su Yu a chance to speak further, quickly saying, "Earlier, the Human Lord asked what I was doing. I said I was always responsible for one thing. This matter is actually quite simple..."

She looked at Su Yu and said solemnly, "Cultivating loyal subordinates of my own. This is related to the pseudo-path! What I wanted to do back then was to use the pseudo-path to replace the true path, even... to kill these true path powerhouses and replace them!"

She took a deep breath, "So, they killed me. I can understand because I wanted to kill them too! I wanted to cultivate pseudo-path powerhouses of the same Great Dao, then descend to seize the power of these true path powerhouses and devour these old ones!"

Su Yu inhaled sharply, "That's ruthless!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others might not have understood, but Su Yu did, "You're targeting these old powerhouses, wanting to gradually replace them without losing strength. Is that what you mean?"

Qi Rong nodded slightly, "Yes! For example, Marquis Dingbei cultivates the spear path. I would cultivate a pseudo-path powerhouse in the spear path, descend, imprison Marquis Dingbei, and let the pseudo-path powerhouse devour his Great Dao power, even merging with it!"

Upon hearing this, Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others understood, and their expressions changed.

This woman... is truly ruthless!

The most venomous is a woman's heart... Ahem, they quickly suppressed this thought.

But if Qi Rong had succeeded back then, it's unimaginable. Perhaps... she could have really replaced these powerhouses, provided the Great Dao fusion was successful.

Qi Rong's voice was hoarse, "You might think I'm ruthless, but since Yue Gang became the Human Lord, why should he be a puppet? He did all the dangerous things, had no power or troops, and had to listen to those people. I was unwilling! Later, the plan was leaked, those old guys were furious, and the plan failed... It seems no one continued it later, or it wouldn't be like this now!"

Su Yu stroked his chin, "You researched for years. You wouldn't have acted rashly without any confidence. How did you ensure the fusion would succeed?"

"All things are connected!"

Qi Rong's voice remained hoarse, "I had someone try it! Marquis Giant Bamboo might know that a top Daofuse Realm powerhouse of the Human Race disappeared back then..."

"Disappeared?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo thought for a moment and said, "Marquis Wushan?"

"It's him!"

Qi Rong said solemnly, "I'm not a good person, nor will I claim to be one. Marquis Wushan humiliated Yue Gang, scolding him at every turn. Later... I had someone secretly capture him and let a pseudo-path cultivator of the same path fuse with him! Devour Wushan!"

Ruthless!

This woman, even Su Yu found her quite ruthless. He had thought she was focused on research, but it turns out she's a ruthless person!

"The one who devoured Wushan not only fully received Wushan's Great Dao power but also advanced further, with hopes of stepping into the quasi-king realm..."

Marquis Giant Bamboo couldn't help but say, "Could it be the later Yue Qi?"

Qi Rong nodded slightly.

Marquis Giant Bamboo was slightly shocked, "It really was him! Later, Yue Qi and Yue Gang initiated the final battle together, and Yue Qi indeed entered the quasi-king realm. He was Yue Gang's most capable subordinate... So that's how it came about! I wondered how Yue Qi, at such a young age, managed to step into the quasi-king realm in just a few thousand years during that period!"

After speaking, he lamented, "It's a pity he later died in battle with Yue Gang."

Qi Rong said calmly, "I guessed it. Yue Gang died, so he probably did too. He was Yue Gang's own nephew. Family is more trustworthy than outsiders! He was also my only successful experimenter. Later, I had no chance to do it again."

Once the plan was exposed, there was naturally no chance to continue.

Su Yu stroked his chin thoughtfully, a smile playing on his lips. "Interesting! But... I don't have the right people on my side. Who could we replace? Marquis Huoyun? Forget it, these people are all obedient. It feels a bit redundant. By the way, can the Human Race replace the myriad races?"

"The Dao principles are similar, so it should be possible. In the Upper Realm, at the Source of the Dao, things are different from the Lower Realm. Any Dao can be cultivated..."

Su Yu nodded, chuckling. "True! Imagine if someone at the Source of the Dao cultivated the physical Dao, could they replace Hundred Battle?"

Suddenly intrigued, Su Yu mused, "What if I find someone who cultivates a pseudo-physical Dao, one of our own, and have them devour Hundred Battle? What do you think?"

Qirong couldn't help but ask, "Is the Ninth Generation Human Lord... really that strong?"

Su Yu laughed, "Strong, absurdly strong, almost reaching the level of the ancient Human Kings."

"......"

Qirong fell silent. This Tenth Generation Human Lord seemed quite audacious, daring to target someone as powerful as the Ninth Generation Human Lord.

After a moment, Su Yu asked, "Since fusion and replacement are possible, let me ask you, can the Great Dao be repaired?"

Qirong was slightly taken aback. "Repaired?"

"Yes, the Human Race's physical Dao seems to have some issues, leading to damage. Otherwise, we wouldn't only have someone like Hundred Battle. Do you think the pseudo-physical Dao could repair the Human Race's physical Dao?"

"It should be possible..."

Qirong hesitated, "Repairing the Great Dao... if it's repaired, wouldn't it just benefit others..."

Su Yu laughed, "How could it? Those who cultivate the physical Dao, the Human Race's physical Dao, are all my people. Except for that Hundred Battle guy, they're all mine. Whoever gets stronger, it's my strength that grows. How could it benefit others?"

"......"

All your people?

At this moment, Qirong couldn't help but think more deeply. Could it be that this man had truly gained complete control over the entire Human Race? That would make him far stronger than Yue Gang!

Yet his strength was only comparable to Yue Gang's.

Su Yu continued to smile, "Interesting, very interesting! Repairing the Great Dao... to be honest, each field has its own specialization. I can't do this myself. I've been pondering how to solve the problems with the Great Dao... and here you are, delivering yourself to my doorstep! I'm not interested in replacing the Great Dao, but I could give it a try. Pseudo-Dao is easy to cultivate. What I'm interested in is repairing the Great Dao, even merging similar Daos... You seem to have a lot of research in this area, especially in Dao fusion!"

Last time, the Great Zhou King had merged two Daos, exhausting himself in the process. That was also a form of fusion! The fusion of pseudo-Dao and true Dao follows the same principle, which reminded Su Yu of many things. He even considered whether he could merge the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King back into the Human Race's physical Dao!

These two were already powerful. Merging them back might allow them to advance further and seize a share of Hundred Battle's Dao!

Su Yu stroked his chin, lost in thought.

Looking at Qirong, he beamed, "I don't like those with too much combat power. I prefer those who use their brains for research. I was a researcher myself, and I greatly admire Consort Qi. Now that Yue Gang is dead, perhaps I can find his necromantic form and reunite you two... but you'll need to do something for me first. Is that a problem?"

"The Death Realm?"

Consort Qi was taken aback. Su Yu smiled, "Yes, I control the Death Realm now. I can help you find him, but if you don't need it, that's fine too!"

Qirong was momentarily stunned, "Can you really find him?"

"Not certain!"

Su Yu laughed, "He's been dead for so many years and hasn't revived yet. Maybe he can't be revived, or maybe he's still in the Celestial River of Death. Who knows if he can be found? I make no promises!"

Consort Qi took a deep breath, "If I refuse, what will the Human Lord do with me?"

Su Yu chuckled, "What a question! I'm not that kind of person! If Consort Qi truly refuses, then so be it. At most, I'll detain you with Wen Qi for a few years. Do you think I would kill you?"

"......"

Qirong tentatively asked, "Does the Human Lord... not wish to let me go?"

Su Yu laughed, "What a thing to say! You owe me your life. You haven't repaid it yet! Of course, I expect gratitude for my kindness. I saved you, so you owe me your life. If you don't repay me, do you think I would just let you go? You underestimate me, Su Yu!"

After a long pause, Qirong finally said, "If Yue Gang had your resolve back then... perhaps... things wouldn't have turned out the way they did."

This talk of gratitude and repayment was spoken with such righteousness!

To Qirong's ears, it was incredibly grating. This new Human Lord was truly an extraordinary figure!
