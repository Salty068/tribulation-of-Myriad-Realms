Chapter 741: Opportunity (Seeking Subscriptions)

Su Yu didn't feel anything was amiss with himself. He just felt a bit regretful. 

If he couldn't kill a Heavenly Sovereign, taking down a Heavenly King would suffice. But alas, it turned out that the pseudo-path was useless. Even self-destruction only managed to kill two Daofuse Realm experts. What a waste of Heavenly King strength.

In the distance, the Heavenly Sovereign Mo was burning with rage. Further away, the Desolate Heavenly Sovereign shook the earth, feeling somewhat stifled as he shouted, "Heavenly Sovereign Mo, be cautious! Also, the Daofuse Realm experts of other races are not enemies. Don't push them too hard!"

From his perspective, perhaps Heavenly Sovereign Mo had been too aggressive.

But Heavenly Sovereign Mo was aggrieved!

Was I being aggressive?

Nonsense!

I didn't even pressure Marquis Bonewing. He suddenly self-destructed. When I captured him, I even held back, not daring to use too much force.

Damn it!

Heavenly Sovereign Mo was extremely annoyed. At this moment, his gaze was cold as he scanned the surroundings, not noticing anything unusual. However, he still spoke with great seriousness, "Why did he self-destruct out of nowhere? Even if he went mad, he should have cherished his life. No matter how crazy, one should know that life is paramount. Self-destruction..."

A powerful being who had slumbered for countless years, only to self-destruct upon awakening, defied logic.

He looked towards March.

March shrugged, "Don't look at me. I was afraid you'd misunderstand, so I didn't even get close!"

Why look at me?

He said this, but he was also puzzled. Self-destruction? Very strange!

Could it be... related to Su Yu?

He couldn't help but speculate. Of course, he had no evidence. No one had any evidence because this was the first time they had discovered this Marquis Bonewing. Could it be that Su Yu had discovered him long ago?

That didn't seem likely!

Even if he had discovered him, how could Su Yu have tampered with the other's path?

March thought of Su Yu's mention of pseudo-path experts... perhaps it really was that guy's doing, unpredictable and unavoidable.

Who could have anticipated this?

This kid was ruthless. A Heavenly King-level expert, just revived, didn't even have time to say a few words before being killed by you.

...

On Su Yu's side.

The skull looked at Su Yu, its voice hoarse, "Was it you?"

This guy could dig me out, which meant he had grasped some things. The previous explosion was most likely his doing, especially since Su Yu had anticipated the self-destruction.

Su Yu smiled, "Indeed."

The skull hesitated for a moment before saying, "You... weren't familiar with that Marquis Bonewing, nor did you know his situation, yet you made him self-destruct? What if... he was an ally of the Human Race... then..."

Su Yu laughed, "No allies. I know who the Human Race allies are. Those without alliances aren't allies."

With that, Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "Do you find it inappropriate?"

"A bit."

The skull didn't deny it, "At least wait for him to reveal his identity..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Once he reveals his identity, how can I surprise him into self-destructing?"

"That's not what I meant..."

"You don't need to mean anything!"

Su Yu said calmly, "You just need to know that I dug you out and saved you. That's enough! If you remember this favor, you'll work for me! If you don't, you won't be able to stir up any trouble!"

"You're quite domineering!"

The skull's eyes cleared a bit, as if gradually recovering, "You seem not to have considered that I might not be willing to serve you."

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling, "I never thought about that because... those who disobey are dead!"

Su Yu chuckled, looking at him again, "This isn't the ancient times. The ancient foundations are gone, all exhausted by the Hundred Battle King! The current Human Race, let's say, is starting anew! Everything from ancient times has been consumed, so you can consider the current Human Race as a new Human Race, unrelated to the past. Thinking this way might make you feel better."

The skull remained silent.

And Su Yu continued to watch.

He was ready to trigger the self-destruction of the second Heavenly King at any moment.

Over there, the Moon Heavenly Sovereign and others were slowly approaching the area where the second Heavenly King was located.

Su Yu scanned the surroundings, frowning slightly. There were few people near the Moon Heavenly Sovereign. If the Heavenly King self-destructed, it might not create much value.

"What a pity, not self-destructing in peak condition. Otherwise, even if the Heavenly Sovereign didn't die, he'd be seriously injured!"

Su Yu regretted again that the opponent wasn't a Heavenly King in peak condition.

They had slumbered for too long!

They had severed their connection with the Great Dao. Such a strong one was only slightly stronger than the skull. If they self-destructed, it would be lucky to kill a Heavenly King.

He was waiting for the second explosion when the skull suddenly said, "Are you here just to blow them up?"

"No, just to weaken their strength!"

Su Yu smiled, "Killing one counts as one. You don't understand. Right now, if they unite, their strength will soar, making it more troublesome!"

The skull's voice was low, "You shouldn't kill these pseudo-path experts. They can all provide power to the Human Emperor, to the Human Emperor's path. Killing them... is a loss!"

With that, he hesitated but still said, "I see you seem to understand the Great Dao here very well, even knowing some things. Are you one of the leaders of the new Human Race?"

"Perhaps!"

Su Yu smiled, "Any advice?"

"These pseudo-paths aren't meant to be used this way..."

He said solemnly, "These pseudo-paths can actually be stripped away! Once stripped, they can allow someone to switch paths and directly become the Heavenly King expert you mentioned! Back then, there were many pseudo-paths here, but none were perfect or complete. The experts of the myriad races cultivated them, actually perfecting these pseudo-paths. When the pseudo-paths become strong enough, you can strip them away and integrate them into the true paths of the Myriad Realms!"

His eyes grew clearer, "In other words, pseudo-path experts can become true path experts! For example, if you cultivate the fire path in the lower realm, but it's hard to cultivate there, you can cultivate the pseudo-path of the fire path here. When you go to the lower realm, as long as there's a way, you can integrate the pseudo-path into it... because the essence of the Great Dao is actually consistent!"

Su Yu was taken aback, looking at him with a changed expression, "Are you saying... the paths here are actually simplified versions, and the paths in the lower realm are enhanced versions? But you can first cultivate the simplified version of the Great Dao, then go and integrate with the lower realm's Great Dao, and they can merge?"

"They can!"

The skull said in a deep voice, "So pseudo-path experts are very precious. They are equivalent to helping nurture the path. Killing them... is the real loss! Back then, when I cultivated the path here, I also had the idea of integrating the true path in the lower realm once I became strong enough! Of course, there was also hope that the Human Emperor could return, preparing for both possibilities!"

Su Yu was thoughtful.

Pseudo-paths can integrate with true paths.

This was the Human Emperor's pseudo-path. In his own Mark of Civilization, those Great Daos were also pseudo-paths.

Pseudo-paths, he had many.

Of course, they weren't strong.

His pseudo-paths could steal power from the true paths, so naturally, the Human Emperor's could too.

Su Yu suddenly looked at the skull, squinting his eyes, smiling, "Are you very skilled in this area?"

"Average."

The skull said in a low voice, "I just researched it for some years before, but later, when integrating the pseudo-path, something went wrong, so I almost perished. I've been in slumber, recovering, but unfortunately, the repair wasn't very good."

Su Yu rubbed his chin, this time taking the initiative to ask, "What's your name?"

"Qi Rong."

Su Yu laughed, "Sounds like a woman's name."

The skull was silent for a while, then said, "I am a woman!"

"......"

Su Yu looked at him, or her, for a long time, at that skin-and-bones body, at that almost skeletal head, and after a while, he grinned, "I... think the undead look better!"

A woman?

Su Yu was speechless!

A woman turned into this, it's... too pitiful, too terrifying!

Really uglier than the undead!

At least the undead can be distinguished by gender, but you can't be distinguished at all.

Xingyue looks better than you, even though her face is black.

People, you see, are afraid of comparisons. When compared, it's truly frightening.

Qi Rong?

That's probably a real name, not a title. Ancient experts usually liked to introduce their titles. Who would specifically introduce their real name? Su Yu found it odd. You say your real name, who knows you?

Take Marquis Lanshan, for instance. What's her real name? Who knows!

Su Yu didn't ask much, quickly saying, "You seem to have a deep understanding of the Great Dao. You know this place is the Human Emperor's path. Did you do research before?"

"Not exactly."

"Not exactly?"

Su Yu was puzzled. What does that mean?

Qi Rong was silent for a while, then said, "Since ancient times, I've only been responsible for one thing, but... until now, I haven't succeeded. You don't need to ask. You can take me to meet your current highest leader. I'll talk to them, hoping you can continue to support me."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow.

The highest leader?

Talking about me!

"Related to the Great Dao?"

"Yes."

Su Yu pondered for a while, then smiled, "Alright, I'll take you to meet them later!"

Saying this, he smiled, "Would you like to rest in my Dao weapon for now? Anyway, you've seen enough, no need to keep looking."

Qi Rong said in a low voice, "I still hope you can kill fewer pseudo-path experts. They are all useful. Some were even specially cultivated by me back then, but now they may have all gone astray..."

Su Yu was taken aback, looking at her.

Qi Rong nodded seriously, "You didn't hear wrong. Some pseudo-path experts of the myriad races were specially cultivated by me back then. Of course, they themselves don't know. This plan was only known to me and Yue Gang back then. Unfortunately, Yue Gang died, and it might not have been passed down... so you don't know these things."

With some regret, Qi Rong added, "I hope you can take me to meet your current highest leader as soon as possible. Otherwise, killing some pseudo-path experts isn't very useful."

Su Yu glanced at her and suddenly said, "Since you're so important, why do you look like a dead person, buried underground?"

For example, Wan Tiansheng and the others are also quite important now. If they were to go into seclusion, even a death seclusion, Su Yu would know something about it, where they are in seclusion, when they'll come out, but this one seems to have been abandoned.

Su Yu observed the scene before him with a frown. The situation was not unfolding as he had anticipated. The group led by Moon Heavenly Venerable had discovered the hidden expert, yet there was no sign of self-destruction or madness. Could it be that the expert had not connected with the Great Dao?

Perhaps, encountering fellow members of the God Race, the expert felt no immediate threat and chose not to link with the Great Dao. Su Yu was at a loss. If the expert continued to refrain from connecting with the Great Dao, would his plans be rendered ineffective?

"I refuse to believe you won't connect with the Great Dao eventually!" Su Yu muttered to himself, frustrated by the turn of events. He had waited patiently, eager to witness the expert's self-destruction, only to be thwarted by the expert's cautiousness.

Meanwhile, on the other side, Mo Heavenly Venerable and his group were also aware of the developments. Mo Heavenly Venerable felt a twinge of envy and remarked, "So it's Six Wings. It seems the God Race has gained another formidable warrior."

Their side had just lost two Daofuse Realm experts, while Moon Heavenly Venerable's group had discovered Six Wings Marquis. The comparison was disheartening.

March, another member of the group, glanced towards the distant scene with a peculiar expression. The aura of Six Wings seemed somewhat unstable, reminiscent of someone practicing a false path. Earlier, Bone Wing Marquis, who had also practiced a false path, had met with disaster. Yet, Six Wings appeared unharmed. Could it be that Bone Wing Marquis truly succumbed to madness on his own, without any interference from Su Yu?

As these thoughts swirled in March's mind, he maintained a simple, honest smile on his face. "It's good news. The stronger we are, the better our chances against the Chaos Race, right?"

"Perhaps," Mo Heavenly Venerable replied with a smile, choosing not to dwell further on the matter.

A new Heavenly King was indeed a stroke of luck, but perhaps soon, they might uncover a hidden powerhouse among the Demons as well.

...

Conversations continued as the search persisted. Meanwhile, Six Wings was steadily strengthening his physical body. The depleted blood essence and source qi were rapidly replenishing, and a faint smile appeared on his face. Not bad. Despite the immense consumption over the years, at least his realm remained stable.

At this moment, he was connecting with the Great Dao. With a bit more time to adapt, he could soon return to his peak state. Unlike the Golden Fire Marquis of the Golden Crow Race, who forcibly connected with the Great Dao, inevitably damaging their physical body and requiring significant time to recover.

Moon Heavenly Venerable waited for a while. Seeing Six Wings recovering well, he couldn't help but smile again. "Brother Six Wings seems to be recovering nicely. Perhaps, after some time, you might advance further!"

"Difficult!" Six Wings shook his head. "After all, I'm not cultivating my own path. It's somewhat superficial."

He then chuckled, "As long as Brother Moon Eclipse is strong, that's enough. Returning to the Divine Race, meeting old friends—whatever instructions you have, just let me know!"

With that, he added, "Brother Moon Eclipse, go ahead with your tasks. I'll continue adapting here. Maybe I'll run into some old friends to chat with."

Moon Heavenly Venerable beamed, nodded, and continued his sweep ahead. Others gradually returned to their positions.

Frost God Marquis, who had previously greeted him, was now operating the Ten Thousand Laws Pagoda with a smile. "Brother Six Wings, come over here. This is the newly crafted Dao Soldier, the Ten Thousand Laws Pagoda. See how powerful it is!"

Six Wings became interested, smiled, and flew over. At this moment, he began attempting to connect with the Great Dao again.

His physical body had grown much stronger. With the Great Dao connection, he now possessed the combat strength of a Heavenly King. Bit by bit, the Great Dao connected, and his aura grew increasingly powerful. As he drew closer to Frost God Marquis, the latter also sensed his formidable aura and remarked, "I see Brother Dao has recovered. Your strength should surpass mine! No wonder Moon Heavenly Venerable said you have the potential to advance further. Perhaps our Divine Race will produce another Heavenly Venerable."

"You're flattering me." Six Wings laughed. Everyone enjoys hearing nice words, but he knew his own situation—it was very difficult!

At this moment, he felt slightly uncomfortable. The power of the Great Dao surged into his body, strengthening his physical form. Yet, a thought vaguely emerged in his mind: kill Frost God Marquis!

Such a notion startled Six Wings. What a joke! This was someone he had a good relationship with in the past. Why was he thinking of killing him?

He was slightly alarmed, but the crazy thoughts in his mind only grew. Kill him! Kill all living beings he saw! It was as if someone was constantly urging him to kill, to eliminate these people who deserved to die!

He was recovering better than Bone Wing Marquis, not losing control as quickly. However, as he absorbed more of the Great Dao's power, the urge to kill intensified. Bone Wing Marquis hadn't absorbed as much of the Great Dao's power.

But now, Six Wings was absorbing more and more of it! His aura grew stronger and stronger!

At this moment, he was extremely close to Frost God Marquis. The latter sensed his formidable aura and remarked again, "If Brother Six Wings hadn't been injured back then, our race would definitely have another Heavenly Venerable by now..."

Beside him, several Divine Race Daofuse cultivators nodded continuously, smiling. Our race has produced another powerhouse!

The urge to kill in Six Wings' heart grew stronger. He barely managed to suppress it, forcing himself to say, "You're overpraising me!"

Yet, in his heart, Frost God Marquis' detestable smile automatically appeared. He was mocking him! Mocking him for being injured back then, and now, even Moon Eclipse Marquis, who was once inferior, had become a Heavenly Venerable, while he himself was not even as good as Moon Eclipse Marquis!

"Kill this detestable guy, kill them all!"

"They're all mocking me, they all want to kill me... Yes, they want to kill me..."

"Brother Six Wings?" At this moment, Frost God Marquis looked puzzled. What's wrong?

Six Wings' expression was somewhat grim. Could it be that he hadn't fully recovered from his long seclusion?

"No... nothing..."

Six Wings saw his face again, that detestable face, feigning concern. Ahead of them, Moon Heavenly Venerable also turned back with a smile, "Six Wings, if you're not feeling well, take a rest. I'll have someone escort you back to the Myriad Races Mountain..."

Moon Eclipse Marquis was also detestable! He actually wanted someone to escort him. What did that mean? Escort or secretly send someone to kill him? Because he might threaten his position?

With such thoughts and the desire to kill, he moved step by step closer to Frost God Marquis. In Frost God Marquis' concerned gaze, Six Wings smiled, and suddenly, six wings appeared behind him.

Buzz!

Those six wings, like sharp blades, flashed through the void!

Pfft!

A massive head, with a hint of confusion, flew into the sky! Frost God Marquis' head floated, filled with bewilderment! Why? Why did Six Wings want to kill him? Had he gone mad?

With a swift motion, Six Wings' speed was incredibly fast. The head was sliced by his sharp wings, instantly cut into countless pieces, even the sea of will was shattered into fragments!

The other Divine Race powerhouses hadn't even had time to react before heads started flying. A Heavenly King, without any defense, suddenly erupted beside them. In an instant, they were all stunned, heads flying.

These ancient marquises, almost all practiced the Weapon Fusion Method. Their weapons weren't drawn, their strength wasn't at its peak, and they weren't on guard. At this moment, heads flew, and the sea of will was shattered.

In the blink of an eye, including Frost God Marquis, a total of four top-tier powerhouses were slain on the spot!

Moon Heavenly Venerable, who was speaking, froze for a moment. The next instant, filled with boundless rage and shock, he roared, "Six Wings, what are you doing?"

Six Wings, eyes blood-red, moved with unimaginable speed, instantly breaking through the void. He didn't go after Moon Heavenly Venerable. He knew he couldn't match him. Even in madness, he retained a sliver of sanity.

Escape! Escape, and find another opportunity to kill them.

Buzz!

The void was sliced open by his wings. The next moment, Six Wings shifted hundreds of miles away, instantly fleeing the scene. Behind him, Moon Heavenly Venerable, with four fireworks exploding, roared in fury and confusion, tearing through the void to chase after him.

"Bastard, you deserve to die!"

He quickly pursued, shouting, "Thunderstorm!"

Thunderstorm was equally surprised but quickly said, "Your clan's matter... handle it yourself. I need to continue sweeping the Dao Source Land. If I leave, someone might take advantage of our gap to return, and that would be a loss!"

Damn it!

Moon Heavenly Venerable was furious! But at this moment, he couldn't care about much else. He was enraged beyond measure. He had treated Six Wings with respect, giving him treasures to restore his body and arranging for someone to escort him back to the Myriad Races Mountain.

Yet, Six Wings had killed Frost God Marquis and the others! Damn it!

He quickly pursued. Behind him, several Heavenly Venerables exchanged glances, all with some confusion and surprise.

Heavenly Venerable Mo frowned slightly. Earlier, Bone Wing Marquis had also gone mad, and now, Six Wings too. Was there some connection between these incidents?

He frowned deeply, considered for a moment, and quickly said, "March, continue the sweep. Others, assist Brother March. I'll go take a look!"

He didn't take everyone away, lest March go easy on them. However, Six Wings was too fast. He worried that Moon Heavenly Venerable might not catch up. Watching the Divine Race's turmoil was enjoyable, but now, something was off with Six Wings. Perhaps... there was something unusual about this.

Why were these powerhouses suddenly losing control one after another?

...

In the distance, Su Yu also took a deep breath. Impressive! This Divine Race guy could still maintain some sanity, and it seemed his aura was quite strong. He had regained some strength before killing.

The key was, after killing, he still knew to run! He also saw two beams of light, flashing by. Both were incredibly fast! One was Six Wings, the other was Moon Heavenly Venerable in pursuit.

Su Yu's eyes flickered. Should I find March and cooperate to take down those left behind? Forget it! There are still several Heavenly Venerables nearby.

Su Yu licked his lips, assessing the direction of their chase. Moon Heavenly Venerable was furious, determined to kill this Divine Race traitor. So... was there a chance to take advantage and kill a Heavenly Venerable-level powerhouse?

Or...

Various thoughts flashed through his mind, not delaying Su Yu's decision. He quickly tore through the River of Time, speeding up unnoticed, rapidly flying towards the Great Dao where Six Wings had been. He flew swiftly and soon found the tributary of Six Wings' Great Dao.

"Fly northwest! That's the only path to survival!"

Su Yu unleashed streams of the power of laws, merging them into that tributary, interfering with Six Wings' choice, directing him northwest. West led to Chaos Mountain, while northwest was closer to the Phoenix Race.

Streams of the power of laws were unleashed. Su Yu didn't care if Six Wings would be affected. Most likely, he would be. This guy had absorbed a lot of the Great Dao's power and was somewhat deranged. He might take this as a revelation from the Great Dao.

...

Soon, Su Yu emerged from the River of Time. He quickly ran towards the outskirts of the Dao Source Land. Along the way, he continuously communicated with Lantian.

"Head northwest, wait for my command in the Phoenix Race area!"

At this moment, Su Yu realized that if things continued like this, with Moon Heavenly Venerable in pursuit, perhaps... there was a real chance to kill him! Killing a Heavenly Venerable, as for the Dao Source Land, who cares! With one less Heavenly Venerable, their sweep would be much harder.

...

At this moment, in the direction of the Myriad Races Mountain, numerous powerhouses frowned. In just a short while, seven fireworks suddenly rose in the eastern direction, including Bone Wing Marquis and Frost God Marquis, both top-tier powerhouses, considered Heavenly King-level existences.

What happened? Wasn't there just a sweep? How did so many people suddenly die!

The three Heavenly Venerables at the border blockade all showed puzzled expressions, with some unease. Did they encounter a formidable enemy?

...

In Chaos Mountain.

Behind the Chaos Forest, at this moment, Yue Hao and his group were climbing the mountain to observe, each showing a different expression. Yue Hao chuckled lightly, "Could it be that the cleansing of the Dao Source Land has forced out the top experts of the Human Race, and they are currently engaged in a great battle?"

"Good news!"

"It seems the Myriad Races have suffered another loss!"

He smiled. The Myriad Races had been suffering significant losses recently, which was indeed good news. As for who was forced out, it didn't matter whether they lived or died; it was of no loss to them. There was some excitement to watch!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu was swiftly following them. However, it wasn't a direct pursuit; he also sensed the presence of Mo Tianzun, who was also tracking them!

"Two Heavenly Sovereigns... Mo Tianzun is here too."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. This could be troublesome. How could he send these guys to Chaos Mountain? Letting them clash with the people of Chaos Mountain would be the best outcome. Unfortunately, Su Yu hadn't yet found the hiding place of those from Chaos Mountain.

The spatial passages of the Space Ancient Beast Race might come in handy this time. These guys were all very fast. Strictly speaking, they were even faster than Su Yu. The Six Wings excelled in speed, comparable to the Heavenly Sovereigns, while Su Yu was a bit slower, gradually falling behind.

Su Yu wasn't worried, though. The spatial passages of the Space Ancient Beast Race were everywhere. He could reach wherever he wanted at any time!

At this moment, the Six Wings were indeed fleeing towards the northwest.

"Let's take it one step at a time!"

Su Yu followed slowly, deciding to assess the situation before making a decision. If there was truly a chance to kill a Heavenly Sovereign, it didn't matter if he could frame it on the Chaos Race or not. Killing one would mean one less threat.

With a crazed Six Wings around, many troubles could be avoided.

At this very moment, a chase was unfolding in the Upper Realm. The Six Wings, though frenzied, retained a sliver of rationality and had actually fled from the Dao Source Land, giving Su Yu a glimpse of opportunity.
