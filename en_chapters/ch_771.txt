Chapter 771: The Path to Completion

Darkness.

Boundless darkness.

Even the soul seemed to be silent.

Experiencing death—it's easy to say, but when truly faced with it, who knows what one might think?

At this moment, Su Yu knew what he was thinking.

He seemed to see a great path, perhaps the Death Path. That path seemed to want to guide him, but... this was the Land of Chaos, and that path seemed unable to reach him!

Is this what death feels like?

Su Yu vaguely saw that path, yet it couldn't come over. It seemed that the Death Path truly couldn't extend here. What a pity.

So, what should I do now?

His will was somewhat muddled.

It seemed to be fading.

"So bored!"

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly had this thought. Truly bored. Why open a path? Why experience death? Hadn't he dreamed of dying every day when he was young? Wasn't that enough?

When I wake up from the dream, I'll be alive again?

Yes, when I wake up, I should be alive!

But how do I wake up from this dream?

"The Path of Life and Death..."

"Should I open a path?"

"What path should I open?"

One muddled thought after another emerged. So tired. It felt like he could just sink into oblivion.

When you're tired, you should rest, right?

Since the age of six, he hadn't had a single peaceful night's sleep. By eighteen, the dreams gradually faded, yet for the past four years, the wars never ceased. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't escape it all.

The Culture King, the Human Emperor, the rulers of the myriad races, Chaos, Heaven Gate, the Gate of Hell, the Control King...

This world had too many secrets.

Even those who had lived for hundreds of thousands of years couldn't unravel all the mysteries. Why should I be the one to unravel them?

Why should I bear this burden?

Because the Time Sage chose me?

Just because the Time Sage chose me, I should bear all this?

I'm too tired!

I want to sleep. Since I was six, I don't think I've ever had a good night's sleep. Fighting, endless fighting, I'm too tired.

At this moment, Su Yu clearly knew he should open the Path of Life and Death.

If he opened it, he might return to reality.

But... suddenly, he didn't want to open it.

"Let me sleep peacefully! Sleep until the end of time..."

Yes, his will was muddled, but he knew he should open the path to resurrect himself. He had the ability to open the path, and he was ready to do so.

But... isn't it tiring?

"Let me be a coward for once! The world won't stop turning just because I'm not in it..."

...

Outside.

The Heaven Gate shattered.

A dragon's head escaped, but Su Yu... was completely gone!

Everyone's expressions turned grave.

Where was Su Yu?

Where was he?

Was he dead?

Wan Tiansheng's face was grim. The next moment, he shouted, "Surround it!"

He needed to see Su Yu!

If Su Yu was dead, he would kill this dragon!

In an instant, over a hundred strong cultivators charged out, surrounding the massive dragon head trying to escape.

The dragon had lost half its body, its aura greatly diminished, but it was still formidable. Even with half its body gone, it was a top-tier powerhouse, not weaker than a Heavenly Sovereign. Among those present, if it fought to the death, it might not kill them all, but it could certainly take down a few top experts.

Wan Tiansheng's aura fluctuated, his voice low, "Where is he?"

The dragon's massive eyes showed a hint of gravity, and it spoke in a low tone, "He's a madman. He broke through the Heaven Gate. Even if it was just the shadow of the Heaven Gate, it's not a place for either of us... He... might have died within the Heaven Gate!"

Wan Tiansheng's face grew darker. He looked around and suddenly shouted, "Wake up! Su Yu, where are you?"

His expression was grim. Something was wrong!

Logically, Su Yu should have opened the path and resurrected by now!

Whether resurrected as a spirit or a living being, he should have been reborn.

But he wasn't appearing!

Since Su Yu dared to open the path, he must have been confident. Why... wasn't he appearing?

Beside him, Marquis Tongtian stepped forward, his expression heavy, "He... he might have fallen into the Heaven Gate."

Wan Tiansheng suddenly looked at him, gritting his teeth in anger and despair, "What do you mean?"

"What is the Heaven Gate?"

"Falling into the Heaven Gate... What's inside the Heaven Gate? Isn't the Heaven Gate just a technique after opening acupoints? Could there be something mysterious behind the Heaven Gate?"

Marquis Tongtian was somewhat intimidated by his gaze, stammering, "Well... the Heaven Gate... Emperor Yu knows... he knows! I... I don't know why... why he broke through the Heaven Gate... but he really knows about the Heaven Gate!"

Wan Tiansheng coldly stared at him, "Tell me... what happens if one falls into the Heaven Gate?"

"I... I don't know!"

Marquis Tongtian nervously said, "I have no experience, I don't know what's going on! Also, Emperor Yu... Emperor Yu..."

He didn't know what to say.

Logically, Su Yu shouldn't have crashed into the Heaven Gate. He knew the Heaven Gate might seal an era, so why did he do it?

Or did he think his Heaven Gate was just a technique he cultivated, so he didn't care much?

Marquis Tongtian stammered, while Wan Tiansheng, gritting his teeth, stared at the dragon, "If he's dead, you will die today!"

The dragon beast remained silent.

But it was ready for a great battle. That guy might really be dead.

The Heaven Gate... the Culture King...

It seemed to have heard the Culture King's voice!

A terrifying existence!

Around them, the strong cultivators were all silent. Wasn't Su Yu supposed to open the path?

Why... wasn't he appearing!

Why?

...

At the same time.

In the boundless darkness.

The man in white couldn't help but glance into the distance again, frowning slightly, "Zhou Wu, did you really not hear anything?"

"Really didn't!"

The burly man angrily said, "If I heard something, would I not tell you? You keep asking, isn't it annoying! If you can't stand it, just go check it out!"

"Alright, just waiting for you to say that!"

As soon as he finished speaking, the burly man cursed, "You're crazy! Don't run around, it's dangerous over there. If you encounter..."

"Stop talking nonsense!"

The man in white frowned, "I have to go check it out, really, I think I saw a dragon!"

"Dragon my ass!"

The burly man cursed, "Where's the dragon? Why didn't I see it? If I saw it, I'd have killed it long ago, killed it and had a meal, haven't eaten in years, I'm starving!"

"Stop talking nonsense!"

The man in white ignored him, tidied his clothes, and quickly flew towards that direction. The burly man cursed again, glanced back, seemingly nervous, "Don't run around, if those guys see you, it'll be trouble..."

"Am I afraid of them?"

"Nonsense, if you're not afraid, go fight them!"

"Later!"

"..."

The two bickered as they quickly flew towards that direction, seemingly crossing time and space. After flying for a while, even crossing rivers and mountain ranges, they finally reached the place the man in white had seen.

The burly man looked around, cursed, "Idiot, I told you there's no dragon!"

After speaking, he paused slightly.

In the void, faintly, a massive dragon tail appeared!

The burly man was stunned!

Strange!

Where did it come from?

It really appeared!

He suddenly looked at the man in white, shocked, "Where did the dragon come from?"

The man in white ignored him, glanced casually at the dragon tail, then quickly shifted his gaze, looking around. Gradually, he frowned, "Here... it seems someone died!"

"Someone died?"

The burly man stepped forward, picked up the dragon tail, excited, "Fresh! Fresh, did you see it? Who cares, we have food now!"

"Shut up!"

The man in white's face changed slightly. Suddenly, the Heaven Gate on his forehead opened. In an instant, it seemed to blind him. He shook his head vigorously, turned to the burly man, "Open your Heaven Gate and take a look!"

"Huh?"

The burly man was stunned. Why open the Heaven Gate?

Alright, open it then!

Soon, his Heaven Gate opened, and he was also momentarily blinded, "Damn!"

The burly man was startled, shocked, "Damn, I think I saw the power of myriad paths... What the hell? Blinded me!"

Where the Heaven Gate looked, it seemed myriad paths appeared, but they were invisible to the naked eye.

And at the end of those myriad paths, there seemed to be a large seal, with a person sleeping on it.

At this moment, that figure seemed to sense something.

In reality, to outsiders, this place was just a dead silence.

But to the man in white, when he looked again, he indeed saw a person, a young man, lazily sleeping on that large seal.

The man in white closed the Heaven Gate, and there was nothing in front of him.

When he opened it again, he was blinded once more.

On that large seal, indeed, a person was sleeping, and this person, above his head, myriad paths were present, sleeping soundly.

He was stunned for a moment, then said, "There's really someone! I... I think I saw... saw... he's resting on a book!"

"Another scholar?"

The burly man was dumbfounded, "What kind of state is this, can't see with eyes closed, see myriad paths with eyes open, what the hell?"

"He's dead!"

"Huh?"

The burly man was stunned, "But I opened the Heaven Gate and saw he's still alive."

"He's still alive."

"..."

The burly man was confused, angrily said, "Speak human language!"

The man in white frowned slightly, "He's dead, yet alive, but... he seems to be opening the myriad paths, but... these myriad paths are too weak! Also not right, this guy... not right, not right... what's going on? Could it be... could it be he made a mistake while opening the myriad paths of life and death?"

"Also not right... he seems to be able to open the path of life and death to resurrect?"

"Also not right, something's off... the book he's resting on, why does it look... like my sister's?"

At this moment, the man in white was also puzzled, strange!

A strange state!

What kind of state is this?

In fact, this was the first time he had seen such a state.

Soon, he saw a somewhat broken door, yes, a door about to dissipate. He was slightly stunned, "Heaven Gate... this is someone who opened the Heaven Gate, he must have accidentally strayed here... not good! Once the Heaven Gate completely disappears, he won't be able to resurrect, he'll completely perish! Is this a human?"

In the depths of chaos, a sudden voice broke through the silence.

"Open the Heaven Gate?" a burly man exclaimed in surprise. "Indeed, without opening the Heaven Gate, it's nearly impossible to reach this place... Can he be resurrected?"

"He can!" The man in white nodded, swiftly activating the Heaven Gate, and gazed at the slumbering youth. In the next moment, the Heaven Gate trembled. "Wake up! Hurry and wake up! If you don't, you'll be truly dead!"

In his dreams, Su Yu heard the voice. It was annoying, like someone yanking off your blanket on a cold winter morning and shaking you awake. He abruptly opened his eyes, the noise too irritating to ignore.

"Who dares?" Su Yu's cold voice echoed as he looked up, seeing two doors in the sky. He frowned slightly.

A deep, resonant voice responded, "Who are you? Are you dead or not? If you don't leave now, the Heaven Gate will close, and you won't be able to leave!"

It was the voice of the burly man, who continued with curiosity, "Did you open the Heaven Gate to get here? But something seems off... Are you human? Are you dead or alive? What did you open? So many paths, it's blinding!"

"Enough questions, there's no time..." A gentler voice interjected, "You must leave quickly. This place is not safe for long. It seems you encountered an accident while opening a path. If you don't leave, you'll fall completely!"

Recognizing the voices, Su Yu's mind raced. He frowned and asked, "Are you unable to leave?"

"Hey, kid, why are you stating the obvious..." the burly man grumbled.

"Martial King?" Su Yu instantly understood. They couldn't leave!

"I came specifically to find you!" Su Yu calculated quickly, sensing his surroundings, and shouted, "Stop wasting time! Shut up! You brute, don't interrupt and waste my time!"

Outside, the burly man was stunned. Did I just get scolded? Why does this sound so familiar? He turned to look at the man in white, realizing he often heard such words from him.

The burly man reopened the Heaven Gate, and this time, he saw clearly. Beneath the blinding myriad paths stood a young man in white with white hair, exuding an extraordinary aura. The young man seemed to be looking at them, perhaps seeing them, perhaps not. Who knew?

The burly man felt this person was speaking to him. He glanced at the man in white, suddenly shocked, eyes wide.

The man in white frowned, turning to look, his frown deepening. "Is that... your son?" the burly man asked in shock. Where did he come from? Why didn't I know? Terrifying! Damn! He has a son?

The man in white glared at him, then looked at the crumbling Heaven Gate, speaking softly, "Leave quickly, or it'll be too late!"

"I know what I'm doing!" Below, Su Yu said solemnly, "The Heaven Gate will disappear in 30 seconds. If you hadn't woken me, I could have slept for another 20 seconds, a truly deep sleep. You two disturbed me! I set a timer; I would have woken up 10 seconds before it shattered!"

Such opportunities were rare for him. Not giving them a chance to speak, he quickly asked, "Is the Time Sage still alive? Just answer yes or no!"

Outside, the burly man was stunned again, looking at the man in white, shocked. Damn, your son is even more reckless than you. What do we do?

"Alive!" The man in white was also shaken. He ignored the burly man because time was short, and the gate was about to shatter.

"Can't you leave?" Su Yu asked.

"No."

"Can anyone enter here through the Heaven Gate?"

"Someone as strong as Zhou Wu could manage."

"Did you encounter a formidable enemy?"

"Yes."

"Is there a real portal for the Heaven Gate?"

"There is."

"Where?"

"Hard to say, it moves."

Su Yu quickly asked a series of questions, then continued, "Did you open the Heaven?"

"I did."

"Stronger than the Human Emperor's path?"

"Not stronger, I don't know how far he's opened it now."

Su Yu frowned, asking again, "Why did the Book of Time return to the Myriad Realms?"

"Seeking help... My sister is dying, and I'm injured. I can't open the Heaven here..."

"Can I come back next time?"

"Hard to say."

This time, the man in white couldn't help but ask, "Are you opening the Heaven?"

"I am."

"Why open the Heaven when you're so weak?"

"Do I have to be strong to open the Heaven? Am I sick?"

The man in white was speechless, then asked, "Are you opening the path of life and death?"

"I am."

"Life and death are hard to open, you..."

"I have confidence. If you hadn't disturbed me, I would have woken up naturally and left. I'm too tired, needed a rest. It's all your fault I'm this exhausted."

The man in white was taken aback. Our fault? What a statement! I'm taking the blame?

"Time is running out!" Su Yu quickly said, "Besides the four houses in the Myriad Realms, are there any other benefits? Don't mention the pen dao, it's too weak. I tried merging it a few times, but it didn't suit me, so I stopped."

Outside, the burly man gaped at the man in white. Damn, your son is really arrogant! The pen dao is weak? He merged it a few times and stopped!

The man in white also recalled previous sensations, his expression changing. "The pen dao isn't weak!"

"For someone opening the Heaven, it's too weak!"

Speechless, the man in white quickly said, "I didn't leave much, just the four houses and the pen dao."

"You've put the Human Race in a tough spot, leaving nothing else?"

I... where do I even begin to argue? It's my first time encountering such an aggressive person. He quickly said, "Did you come to find me?"

"Sort of. I guessed you might be here, but didn't expect to actually meet you. If not, I would have returned soon..."

Su Yu spoke quickly, only 5 seconds left. He had to leave immediately; those outside might be anxious. He had set a timer for himself. Wanting to sleep was true, wanting to escape was true, but... reality didn't allow it! He only took a chance, hoping to find something by entering the Heaven Gate. As for leaving... he could naturally leave!

"Really no benefits left?"

"None!" The man in white was depressed. Why... why should I give you benefits? Why? The pen dao and four houses aren't enough?

"Forget it, I'm leaving. Asking is pointless!" Su Yu was also depressed. No benefits at all, what a waste of a trip. Although he had guessed as much, hearing there were no benefits was still incredibly frustrating. He turned to fly towards the shattering Heaven Gate, ready to return!

Not wasting time with these two! At this moment, the burly man was anxious. "You came from the Myriad Realms? How are my descendants?"

"Dead!"

"You... you're lying..."

"Killed because of you. Why did you run? You ran, the myriad races rebelled, the world fell into chaos. The Culture King probably guessed it. The Culture King wouldn't ask such a foolish question. At least he left something behind, unlike you... not even worth bothering with!"

"Hey, kid, you're arrogant. I have contingencies... don't rush off, I sealed..."

"Martial Emperor, I know. I'm leaving!"

In an instant, the shattered Heaven Gate disappeared. At the same time, the man in white seemed to remember something, suddenly shouting, "If you can resurrect, remember, resurrect Xingyue... Opening the path of life and death might give hope to resurrect Xingyue... Remember!"

He roared, his face turning a bit blue. Damn, I was just bluffed by this kid and didn't have time to say it. Did this kid hear it?

The burly man was stunned, turning to the man in white, muttering, "Your son... is really arrogant! And you're still thinking about Xingyue? You're really something!"

"Your brother is about the same!" The man in white frowned slightly, not taking the bait about Xingyue, quickly continuing the previous topic, "As expected, when you chased after me back then, I knew the Myriad Realms would be in trouble. Sure enough! This person inherited my pen dao, got the Book of Time... and ended up opening a path himself, even coming here... just to see me?"

"Seeking his father?" The burly man was shocked. "Truly filial!"

As for Xingyue, he didn't mention it again. Forget it, good brothers don't bring up sad things.

"Enough nonsense!" The man in white frowned, "The situation in the Myriad Realms is probably not good. Otherwise, he wouldn't open a path when he's so weak. It doesn't make sense. And... it seems he fought with this giant dragon!"

He quickly speculated on some things, looking at the burly man for a long time, "You, as expected, don't do good deeds. Look, trouble!"

The burly man was stifled, soon feeling gloomy. "My son seems to be dead!"

The man in white was slightly startled, speaking after a moment, "Maybe he's become a spirit. If I can return, I'll help you find a way to resurrect him!"

"Alright then!" He quickly put the matter aside, unable to deal with it now. He quickly said, "That wasn't really your son just now? He seemed... even more arrogant than you!"

"That's your brother!"

The burly man glared at him. You're insulting me! Don't think I can't understand. Believe it or not, I'll beat you up!

The man in white was about to speak when his expression changed. "Let's go, trouble is coming!"

The burly man quickly followed him in retreat, his voice faintly heard, "You really didn't leave any descendants? That kid just now really looked a bit like you! My god, he broke through the gate to find you, such deep feelings!"

"Shut up!"

"See, even the way he talks is the same!"

"If you don't shut up, I'll kill you!"

"Scholar, mind your manners..."

"I..."

The two quickly vanished from the spot.

In the chaos, a great battle was about to erupt. Su Yu had yet to resurrect, possibly in real trouble. The giant dragon's aura surged, chaos energy spilling out, ready for an all-out battle. At that moment, the space rippled slightly, and a somewhat ethereal voice rang out, "Open!"

A low shout echoed through the world.

In an instant, a pitch-black Death Path emerged, and a figure appeared out of nowhere, their white robes turning into black.

"Your Majesty!"

Everyone was overjoyed!

Even the giant dragon trembled. He... was still alive!

In the void, Su Yu stepped onto the Death Path, not rushing to speak. Instead, he frowned and let out a low roar, "Open!"

A Path of Life appeared!

Su Yu stepped onto it, but the black aura refused to dissipate.

The death aura couldn't be dispelled!

Caught between life and death, he couldn't transform back into a living being. Su Yu frowned and shouted again, "Revive!"

Rumble!

A powerful aura surged from his body, yet the death aura persisted, growing even more intense.

Su Yu's expression changed slightly, and he shouted once more, "Revive!"

He stepped into the Path of Life, the clash of life and death energies sizzling, but he still couldn't transform back into a living being. Su Yu roared, "Open again!"

Paths appeared one after another!

"Open the paths of life and death!"

The countless paths left two gaps, filled by the two paths, yet they couldn't connect.

Life and death were distinct!

They couldn't merge!

Su Yu frowned, looking at Wan Tiansheng and the others, shrugging helplessly, "Don't look at me like that. I knew I might succeed in transforming life into death, but transforming death into life... is likely to fail!"

Su Yu sighed, "I can endure death without needing Hetu's insights or reminders! This isn't my first brush with death, even if only in dreams. My resilience isn't so weak as to crumble from a single death!"

Even if it were true death, he could withstand it.

The key was, after death, he was now considered a spirit of death, and he couldn't return!

He couldn't transform back into a living being!

As a result, the path couldn't be perfected!

The giant dragon was stunned, looking at Su Yu, stammering, "You... can really revive?"

"Of course!"

Su Yu frowned, "I haven't revived, can't you see I'm in a death spirit state? Are you blind? I failed to open the path, are you satisfied?"

"No... you... at the last moment, were you calling someone?"

Su Yu glanced at him and suddenly laughed, "You're lucky. I thought you might stay inside, but you managed to escape! Oh, it seems someone took your tail. I didn't see it myself, but... it's likely someone took it and ate it!"

The giant dragon's expression changed unpredictably, guessing who might have eaten it... but dared not say anything.

Su Yu looked at it, "You can leave now. You blocked me once, did your duty. If you don't leave, do you really think my people can't kill you?"

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "Not killing it? It will become a threat sooner or later!"

Su Yu laughed, "Forget it. If we really kill it and it self-destructs, killing some of our strong ones, it's not worth it! Let it go, it's quite powerful!"

The giant dragon looked at Su Yu, then at Wan Tiansheng, its giant eyes flickering with light, "Did you really fail to open the path?"

Su Yu squinted, "What if I failed, what if I succeeded? Do you... really think I can't kill you?"

His aura suddenly grew stronger, but it was all death aura, lacking vitality.

At this moment, he was stronger than when he had fought the opponent before.

The giant dragon was silent for a while, gradually retreating, retreating far away, and said in a deep voice, "You opened the path in chaos, sooner or later you'll be enemies with chaos!"

"Shut up!"

Su Yu said irritably, "I'm not in good shape now, don't provoke me!"

The giant dragon fell silent again and turned to leave.

This place couldn't be stayed in.

The Culture King!

That terrifying existence, it had heard the voice before, could Su Yu summon him?

No one knew!

It was a bit scared!

The giant dragon retreated.

Su Yu breathed a slight sigh of relief. That guy still had extremely strong combat power. If a battle really broke out, some people here would die, which wasn't worth it. Avoiding unnecessary conflict was best!

But while he relaxed, the others were tense.

Marquis Huoyun looked at the death aura surrounding Su Yu, nervous, "Your Majesty... what will you do?"

Was he really dead?

Had he turned into a death spirit?

Transforming from life to death was easy, but from death to life, even with the Path of Life opened, Su Yu couldn't revive. Was it over?

Su Yu ignored him and looked into the distance at the Land of the Abyss, silent for a while, then took a deep breath and exhaled, releasing death spirit aura.

"Life and death are just a thought away!"

Su Yu didn't care much, contemplating. The next moment, his voice resonated, "Open, draw the power of life and death here, I'll try again!"

Then, he looked at Wan Tiansheng and the others, laughing deeply, "Go, all of you, to the depths of the Abyss, intimidate those sealed guys! Also, intimidate the North King and the others, make them keep a low profile, don't cause trouble for me. I'll try again, if it doesn't work... a death spirit is a death spirit! I'll figure it out myself!"

Wan Tiansheng frowned, quickly nodding, "I'll go intimidate the North King and the others. Senior Fat Ball, you take the others to intimidate those in the sealed land. If they cause trouble, break the formation and kill them!"

"......"

Fat Ball was speechless, really?

Can't beat them!

Alright, whatever you say.

It quickly left, but before leaving, it glanced back at Su Yu, puzzled, "You... that... I..."

"I saw your master, but across a space-time, across life and death..."

Fat Ball was stunned.

Su Yu smiled, "Still alive, the Time Sage exaggerated, saying he was about to die, nonsense, they're all still alive! The Martial King is full of vigor, I didn't see any signs of dying, though he is injured!"

He didn't mention that the Time Sage seemed to be absent, possibly in trouble, no need to bring that up.

Fat Ball's eyes brightened, he... saw the master!

Really?

Su Yu added, "Don't ask if it's true, it is! The Culture King said he misses you very much, yes, that's it!"

"Liar!"

Fat Ball suddenly felt sad, "The master doesn't like me, he likes Doubao..."

"......"

Su Yu was speechless!

Beside him, Doubao blinked, staying silent, best not to speak, Fat Ball might hit it!

Su Yu was at a loss for words, quickly saying, "That's not true, the Culture King said he misses you very much! Believe it or not, he just can't come out now. He said he needs reinforcements, wants you to reach the realm of the ruler of rules and go find him!"

"Really?"

"I never lie!"

Su Yu nodded.

Anyway... you're not human!

Fat Ball quickly wagged its tail, suddenly becoming cheerful, "The master is really alive? I thought I smelled something!"

At this moment, the others were also slightly moved.

The Culture King?

Was Su Yu telling the truth or lying?

Why did it feel not entirely believable!

Su Yu ignored them, believe it or not, he had ventured into the Heaven Gate this time just to test, and indeed, he encountered it.

The Heaven Gate he opened might be an opportunity.

Of course, now wasn't the time to think about these things.

Su Yu shouted, "Alright, go, I'm going to attempt to reverse life and death!"

The Path of the Universe wasn't perfected yet.

If I really become a death spirit, how will I get out?

All black, not stylish at all.

Everyone left one after another.

Soon, the void trembled, and in the entire Death Realm, auras rose, intimidating all directions!

...

In the Death Path, the Great Zhou King looked solemn.

At this moment, he was opening a life and death passage with Marquis Lanshan. The power of life continuously overflowed from the Great Zhou King, and death aura also overflowed from Marquis Lanshan. In the passage they constructed, black and white forces intertwined.

At this moment, Marquis Lanshan looked pained, asking several times, "Haven't you connected to the Ink Path yet?"

Behind them, the South King resisted the pressure from various strong beings in the River of Time, remaining silent, looking ahead, the Ink Path was still not there.

The Great Zhou King gritted his teeth, speaking lowly, "Almost there, hold on! Remember, don't die, as long as you don't die, His Majesty has hope of reviving you... once revived, your chance will come... maybe... in this era, you'll be King Lanshan!"

"Really?"

Marquis Lanshan was excited, "Being crowned king... must feel great!"

"Really!"

The Great Zhou King smiled, and Marquis Lanshan also smiled, "Once crowned king, will you repay the grain and salary you owe me?"

"......"

The Great Zhou King was speechless, finally nodding after a long time, "If I'm alive, I'll repay, if I'm dead, it's gone!"

He had already seen the death aura overflowing from Marquis Lanshan, the speed of overflow extremely fast. The power of life and death, for a pure death spirit like Marquis Lanshan, was hard to bear. Actually, Su Yu and Liu Hong could bear it.

Unfortunately, one was in the Land of Chaos and couldn't leave, leaving would collapse the path.

The other had to open the Ink Path, and Liu Hong's strength wasn't enough, he might not be able to draw the power of life and death.

Marquis Lanshan laughed, "Alright... debtor, don't worry, I won't die... besides, I've already died once, dying again is nothing!"

Her death aura continuously overflowed, her figure vaguely becoming illusory. Behind her, the South King saw this, just about to step forward to help, when her expression suddenly changed, shouting coldly, "Dizhi Luo, you really dare to cause trouble!"

Boom!

In the Celestial River of Death, a shadow appeared from the water, with a sinister laugh, "Intruding into my domain, Yu Ziqi, you're the one seeking death!"

Boom!

A battle erupted, a battle of the power of rules.

The South King still had to maintain the passage from being destroyed. At this moment, although the opponent was sealed, fighting in the Celestial River of Death, in the opponent's domain, was still difficult.

...

At the same time.

Outside the sealed land.

Fat Ball was actually stunned, its eyes seemed to see something, seeing a pillar of light violently fluctuating, as if it knew something. The next moment, it was extremely furious, "How dare you, you're courting death!"

Boom!

A massive boot descended from the sky, directly stomping towards the sealed land!

This stomp... Dizhi Luo didn't care, stomp it, stomp and break the seal, that would be best!

However, when the boot touched the seal, suddenly, the seal flickered, as if sensing the power of the Culture King. Suddenly, the seal seemed to lose its effect, a loud explosion!

The force of the kick shattered the pillar of light where Dizhi Luo stood!

Fat Ball was momentarily stunned. "Huh, did it go through?"

In the next instant, it was startled and quickly maneuvered the boot to fly out. At that moment, the pillar of light from the Death Emperor flickered briefly, attempting to surge forth, but with a bang, the seal reappeared!

The face of the Death Emperor emerged, even manifesting a faint shadow. It suddenly looked at Fat Ball outside with a peculiar gaze. "Is this... the Culture King's boot?"

"Indeed!" White Dog hurriedly put away the boot, somewhat delighted. "Oh, the Radiant King actually left a backdoor for my master... You're done for. I'll come and stomp on you whenever I'm free!"

Only at this moment did Dizhi Luo's face appear, filled with pain and rage. "You bastard, you..."

"Stomp!"

Dizhi Luo instantly went on the defensive, only to find that White Dog was merely bluffing. Fat Ball, on the other hand, was quite pleased, cheerfully saying, "I won't stomp on you. That guy actually tried to escape. If he really runs, it'll be troublesome! Unless he doesn't run, then I'll come and stomp on you!"

The Death Emperor said nothing, merely glanced at it, then at Dizhi Luo, and calmly stated, "Enough, don't complicate matters further!"

He could sense the commotion within the Great Dao. However, it was still in a sealed state. Was it necessary to fight to the death with these people? Dizhi Luo was just being idle!

After being stomped, Dizhi Luo was also beaten by the South King within the Great Dao, feeling somewhat stifled and refrained from causing further trouble.

...

Moments later.

Deep within the Land of the Abyss, Liu Hong's expression shifted. In the next moment, the power of the Great Dao trembled as he looked towards Su Yu in the distance and shouted, "It's coming, can you handle it?"

Su Yu glanced at him but didn't respond.

At that moment, Liu Hong stopped speaking. The power of the Great Dao trembled violently, and in the next moment, he roared, and a Great Dao manifested, "Draw it in!"

Boom!

A surge of life and death force flowed in.

In the next moment, the Great Zhou King emerged with Marquis Lanshan. At this moment, the Great Zhou King's hair had turned much whiter, and Marquis Lanshan's aura had weakened significantly, yet she was still alive.

Seeing this, Su Yu breathed a slight sigh of relief.

The Great Zhou King smiled. "Don't worry, if she were truly about to die, I would intervene! I know your thoughts!"

If someone died just to open the path, Su Yu would likely cause trouble for him.

Su Yu glanced at him and suddenly said, "It seems you've consumed a lot of life force; you won't live long!"

The Great Zhou King laughed. "I share the same fate as His Majesty! If His Majesty can break the seal and make me a master of the rules, I can live! His Majesty only has a little over ten years of lifespan left, so why should I linger?"

Su Yu chuckled. "Zhou Tian, you're not waiting for the next one?"

"No more waiting!"

The Great Zhou King smiled. "Because... I've found it! If I wait any longer, His Majesty the Human Emperor will return... It probably won't be smooth, or he would have returned long ago! He's likely hoping for reinforcements for the human race!"

He had guessed it.

The situation on the Human Emperor's side was probably not good. Otherwise, he would have returned directly without any hindrance!

Su Yu nodded slightly, not saying much. At this moment, a black and white force began to emanate from Liu Hong. Having stayed at the intersection of life and death for a long time, he was not burdened by this power.

Liu Hong roared, taking steps towards the edge of chaos, shouting, "Stop chatting... Hurry... Quickly guide it in!"

What was there to chat about!

And Su Yu, taking steps towards the edge of chaos, smiled, "Teacher Liu, in light of you guiding the force of life and death for me today, I'll clear the debt of the tens of thousands of merit points you snatched from me back then!"

"..."

Liu Hong was dumbfounded.

My heavens!

You still remember those tens of thousands of merit points?

My goodness!

How long ago was that?

That was from so long ago, and besides, tens of thousands of merit points... Do you still care about merit points now?

That was from the Source Opening period, something anyone should have forgotten by now, right?

Yet, it was only at this moment that Su Yu cleared this debt for him.

Liu Hong suddenly felt like crying. Should I be touched?

"I... thank you!"

Liu Hong cried as he thanked him, and Su Yu nodded, "You're welcome, it's only right!"

Damn you, it's only right.

This time, he finally witnessed how petty this guy could be.

At this moment, a black and white force surged into the chaos.

Su Yu laughed, the Great Dao manifested, and the robust power of the Great Dao instantly connected with the black and white force, with countless life and death forces surging in!

"From death to life... resurrection from death..."

Su Yu absorbed a large amount of life and death force, murmuring, "Death, rebirth, half-alive, half-dead... Perhaps, I should be the most clear! The Book of Time has allowed me to experience it countless times; I should be clearer than anyone!"

And the moment of true death just now deepened his understanding.

At this moment, the black and white forces intertwined on his body!

And at this moment, Su Yu suddenly realized why he couldn't be reborn from death?

He suddenly turned his head in a direction and laughed, "Sorry, I need to cut off something first... You were still feeding me death energy!"

Su Yu sighed, smiling wryly, "It's not that I lack death energy, it's that I lack life energy. Women... even in death, they tend to mess things up, unreliable!"

Liu Hong and the others were slightly stunned. What did he mean?

And at this moment, above Su Yu's head, an invisible passage suddenly broke!

The death energy was slightly heavier!

It was related to this passage, interfering with my life and death balance.

The moment the passage broke, the balance of life and death on Su Yu's body was instantly achieved!

Simultaneously, in a distant direction, within an ancient castle, a figure suddenly appeared, looking towards the depths of the Land of the Abyss. As they watched, a hint of melancholy appeared, slowly descending.

Broken!

Good!

Let it break, I've long wanted to break it!

"Hmph!"

A cold snort echoed, and with a rumble, the castle gate closed. Outside the castle, several subordinate undead fell silent. Our king seems very angry, so it's best not to disturb him now.

...

At this moment, Su Yu's smile was radiant. "Probably quite upset, huh?"

Probably!

But it had to be broken. Xingyue didn't understand what she was doing. Seeing my consumption was high, she kept feeding me death energy. Without breaking the passage, I'd never be reborn.

"We'll talk about it later!"

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry. At this moment, the balance of life and death on his body gradually stabilized, the death energy was expelled, and life energy began to revive.

Then, life and death once again became imbalanced, with life energy surpassing death energy.

"Merge!"

A low shout shook the surroundings. Within the Great Dao, the paths of life and death suddenly erupted with brilliant light!

At this moment, the entire chaotic land suddenly trembled violently!

Rumble!

A massive Great Dao spanned the heavens and earth, where it passed, the chaotic aura dissipated, retreating!

Where the Great Dao covered, all chaotic forces dissipated!

The world was being opened!

At this moment, it truly seemed like the beginning of the world, with earth and sky suddenly emerging in the chaotic void!

As it continued to extend deeper, where the Great Dao extended, the world began to expand!

The entire Death Realm seemed to tremble, and the Death Dao seemed to sense something.

Not only that, but at this moment, the Time Dao of the Myriad Realms also seemed to sense something, trembling slightly.

In the Upper Realm, the Human Emperor's Dao was also trembling!

Another piece of pure land had appeared in this world!

The world Su Yu opened was somewhat murky, different from the Death Realm, different from the Human Emperor's Dao, and similar to the Time Dao of the Myriad Realms, but with an added force of life and death!

At this moment, Su Yu's aura grew stronger and stronger!

Rumble!

The chaotic Myriad Realms were trembling, but very weakly, because the world Su Yu opened was too small.

But no matter how small, it was still a world!

That rainbow-like Great Dao began to extend, extending beyond a thousand meters, beyond ten thousand meters, and then... abruptly stopped!

Su Yu's expression changed slightly, and soon, he sighed, "Weak!"

Too weak!

The Human Emperor's Dao, even if not fully opened, created a territory as large as the Source of the Dao, and the size of the territory often represented the strength of the Great Dao!

And my world, ten thousand meters in radius!

Does this count as a world?

Well, it barely counts!

The moment the Great Dao extended, the entire chaos began to tremble again!

The world began to stabilize!

And Su Yu's aura continued to rise, growing stronger!

"This path, for now, shall be the Cosmic Civilization Path!"

The name was grand, but in reality, it was weak. However, Su Yu hoped that one day, this path would truly become the core of cosmic civilization!

A world with a radius of ten thousand meters, so what?

I will eventually expand it to be larger than the Myriad Realms!

At this moment, Su Yu's life energy erupted, full of confidence. In the next moment, he laughed heartily, "Martial Emperor, I'm coming to play with you!"

Boom!

A surging aura rose, and Su Yu shot out, tearing through the void, instantly disappearing into the chaos.

To find the Martial Emperor for some practice!

...

At the same time.

Deep within the Time Dao.

A faint ripple gradually spread, spreading, continuing to spread!

It continued to extend!

Until it reached the depths upstream, suddenly, the shadow reappeared, with a hint of confusion. What happened again?

What the heck!

What exactly is going on in the Myriad Realms lately?

Just as he was thinking, rumble!

The waters of the long river suddenly trembled, thumping and shaking!

The shadow trembled slightly, soon revealing a bewildered expression. "Another master of the rules has died?"

Heavens!

What is going on?

I can't sense too far!

This tremor, could it be that the Martial Emperor died a second time?

Ridiculous!

If it's not the Martial Emperor who died, could there be another master of the rules in the Myriad Realms who was just taken down?

"Your Majesty, what happened again?"

Someone was puzzled.

The golden shadow hesitated for a moment, then said after a while, "The Martial Emperor was killed!"

"..."

An odd emotion erupted.

That's not right.

Wasn't he just killed a moment ago?

Killed again?

The golden shadow felt it might lack some credibility, thought for a moment, and added, "A moment ago, the Martial Emperor's Great Dao collapsed, and now, his sea of will has been shattered, completely fallen!"

Yes, that's correct!

Chapter 789: The Flow of Time

The intervals weren't long; perhaps that's just how it is! Otherwise, he couldn't explain why the River of Time trembled every so often recently.

Everyone remained silent.

Alright, whatever you say, we'll reluctantly believe you.
