Chapter 805: Unsealing the Upper and Lower Realms

"Apologize to me in front of all the realms."

The Martial Emperor fell into deep thought.

The Sky Opener...

Suddenly, he sneered, "You plan to kill me when I slay the third ruler of laws, so you won't have to apologize, right?"

Such a cunning Su Yu!

He could actually pull it off!

Su Yu was taken aback. Wow, you actually have a brain!

The thing is... I wasn't even thinking that. How did you come up with it?

Why bother!

It's not like apologizing will cost you anything, and even if it did, so what?

Besides, even if I do apologize... would you even accept it?

Should I apologize for insulting you, Martial Emperor? For saying your backside was planted with flowers, for saying you were hung upside down and buried underground for hundreds of thousands of years, for saying you were brainless, for calling you trash...

That's probably what the apology would sound like, right?

But... there's no helping it. I did insult you over those things. If I apologize, that's what I'd have to say.

Su Yu thought to himself.

As for killing the Martial Emperor when he slays the third ruler of laws, Su Yu hadn't even considered it yet.

The Martial Emperor sure had a lot of thoughts when he should have been thinking less.

Su Yu smiled, "Martial Emperor, how could that be! If you can truly kill three rulers of laws, an apology is nothing. I, Su Yu, am not someone who would turn my back on a promise."

The Martial Emperor sneered, "That's exactly the kind of person you are!"

Su Yu cursed inwardly. You're the one, your whole family is! I've always been an honest and reliable young man!

The Martial Emperor sneered again, "That's exactly what you're thinking, isn't it? Su Yu, you're insidious beyond measure. To achieve your goals, you disregard all manners and integrity!"

Su Yu was helpless!

These words... truly left him speechless.

Is that really how the Martial Emperor sees me?

Nonsense!

Su Yu swore, "I swear, if I kill you when you slay the third ruler of laws, I'll... I'll have flowers planted on my backside just like you!"

The Martial Emperor's face turned ashen!

Su Yu had insulted him again!

An unparalleled insult, right to his face, time and again.

Bastard!

Beast!

May you die a horrible death!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was furious to the extreme. This beast was simply inhuman.

The Martial Emperor's aura fluctuated as he coldly said, "Su Yu, you want to cooperate, yet you show no sincerity at all!"

Su Yu chuckled, "No sincerity? How could that be! If I truly had no sincerity, I would have killed you long ago. Why waste words with you? Do you think I can't kill you? Not to mention you're currently sealed, even if you were unsealed, I could still kill you! That Saint Transformation Seal earlier was actually left by the Culture King to deal with you, but I didn't use it against you; I used it against those undead instead!"

Su Yu laughed, "Moreover, at this moment, I have over ten Heavenly Sovereigns under my command, a bunch of Heavenly Kings, and over a hundred in the Dao Integration Realm! To put it bluntly, I just don't want my people to fall. Otherwise, even if you were unsealed, I'd still kill you!"

"Over ten Heavenly Sovereigns?"

The Martial Emperor was stunned. How could that be!

Su Yu laughed, "Don't believe it? Want to bet?"

He shrugged and laughed, "Forget it, you'd just cheat on a bet!"

The Martial Emperor coldly said, "That's you. I, the Emperor, always keep my word!"

Su Yu laughed, "What nonsense. You have quite the memory. Have you forgotten when you killed the East Heavenly King and promised to teach me the Zhou Tian Method? What happened? You only told me part of the acupoint operation method. Have you forgotten?"

The Martial Emperor was taken aback, then quickly said in a low voice, "But you learned it!"

Su Yu laughed, "That was my own deduction. I just ask you, did you tell me the entire method?"

The Martial Emperor hesitated!

He wanted to say he hadn't intended to cheat. Last time, he had almost told Su Yu all the acupoint operation methods, but some techniques couldn't be fully disclosed.

Besides, last time he wasn't that familiar with Su Yu. In his eyes, Su Yu was just a small bug. Wasn't it normal not to keep promises with a bug?

Who would take words with an ant seriously?

But now, caught by Su Yu, the Martial Emperor didn't know what to say.

Indeed, it seemed... he was more of a cheat than Su Yu.

At this moment, the Martial Emperor fell silent.

Su Yu, however, laughed, "Forget it, a gentleman doesn't hold grudges against a petty person! Martial Emperor, just say whether you agree or not. Why so much nonsense? I've even sworn an oath. If you still find it unsatisfactory, then forget it!"

The Martial Emperor frowned, "Then... who are the rulers of laws you want me to kill? You can't just tell me to kill the Control King or the Human Ancestor. They're also rulers of laws!"

He wasn't completely foolish.

He wouldn't just believe whatever Su Yu said.

The three rulers of laws varied greatly. Who knew who he was supposed to kill?

Su Yu laughed, "How about this, the three rulers of laws I'm talking about aren't any well-known figures. If they were, I wouldn't send you to kill them. That would be sending you to your death, which would be a bit insulting to me, Su Yu!"

The Martial Emperor pondered for a moment and quickly said, "Alright, for the three rulers of laws, I want to choose and evaluate them myself!"

Su Yu laughed, "Choose yourself? How about choosing me? Isn't that nonsense?"

The Martial Emperor was silent for a while, "Then... then I want the option to refuse!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "Alright! You can refuse three times! For example, if I tell you to kill the Culture King and you refuse, that's fine! But you can't keep refusing, otherwise... it's meaningless!"

"If you keep refusing, isn't that a complete loss?"

Su Yu laughed again, "This way, for both your sake and mine, let's set a deadline. For instance, before the Human Emperor and the others return, before the Heaven Gate opens, you must fulfill the promise of killing three rulers of laws!"

"This way, before the strong return, is there any ruler of laws you wouldn't dare to kill?"

That's true!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor felt a bit more at ease. Setting a deadline seemed like a good idea, completing it before the Human Emperor and the others return!

Thinking of this, he added, "Then what about the matter of helping me increase my strength..."

Su Yu laughed, "Do you believe it?"

Believe it?

If it were before, he would have said no, get lost!

But now... he kind of believed it.

That idiot Taishan managed to cultivate to that level, precisely because, as Su Yu said, Taishan was surrounded by smart people. Smart people, even when increasing their strength, do it quickly, while he lacked such smart people around him.

Su Yu was one!

This guy not only improved quickly himself, but his subordinates also advanced rapidly.

Thinking of this, the Martial Emperor said in a deep voice, "I believe it! So, I have one more request, at least... at least let me reach the level Taishan was at back then!"

Reach the level of the Four Extremes Human King!

Su Yu fell into thought, and the Martial Emperor sneered, "Can't do it?"

Su Yu was helpless, "It's not that I can't do it, but I don't know how strong the Four Extremes Human King was! Besides, if you don't listen, don't believe me, even if I help you improve, give you opportunities, you won't be able to seize them! This is a two-way street, and you can't forcefully push you to improve, right?"

The Martial Emperor thought for a moment, realizing this made sense.

Thinking of this, he nodded, "If it benefits me, if it truly helps me increase my strength, then I can listen to you!"

And that's that!

Su Yu smiled brightly.

The Martial Emperor was so easy to fool, no, so obedient!

No, this is called being wise and understanding the times!

Yes, that's the logic!

Su Yu laughed, "So it's settled, Martial Emperor, you have no objections, right?"

The Martial Emperor felt something was off!

But... where exactly, he couldn't pinpoint.

He knew that someone like Su Yu, a scholar, was the most insidious, and he hesitated again.

Su Yu said calmly, "You're always hesitating. It's one thing to be a brainless warrior, but if you're also indecisive, then you're beyond saving! Warrior, since you're reckless, be reckless to the end!"

"You don't want to think, yet at crucial moments, you hesitate. People like you... are destined not to achieve great things!"

The Martial Emperor's face darkened!

Su Yu said calmly, "Isn't that so? What can you think of? If I were you, I'd unseal myself first, regardless of the consequences! As for the future, deal with it later! Right now, I can kill you, your life is hanging by a thread, and you're still pondering if you're being schemed against... can someone like you achieve great things?"

The Martial Emperor's expression changed repeatedly, coldly saying, "I just don't want to be your pawn!"

Su Yu shrugged, "That's the reality. Of course, it's a transaction! I offer my terms in exchange for you being a pawn. If you think someone else can offer such terms, you can try! Go find someone else to cooperate with! And one more thing, Martial Emperor, if you don't cooperate with me, you might not even have a chance to break the seal. It's not that I want to kill you, but someone doesn't want to see you unsealed!"

The Martial Emperor frowned, "Are you talking about the Hundred Battle King?"

"How would I know!"

Su Yu laughed, "Guess for yourself, since you like to overthink!"

The Martial Emperor was choked by his words.

Damn you!

Talking to a scholar is troublesome, constantly mocking and annoying!

"Then when... will you help me unseal?"

The Martial Emperor stopped thinking. Maybe Su Yu was right. Unseal first, then talk about the rest.

Su Yu laughed, "Whenever you want, of course, to unseal, the rules of the Myriad Realms must dissipate first! I still need to prepare, like unsealing the passage first, then dispersing the power of laws... anyway, it's a quick matter!"

This time, the Martial Emperor didn't remain silent for long and quickly said, "I want to unseal immediately!"

"Are you sure? Will you turn against me once unsealed?"

"No!"

This time, the Martial Emperor answered decisively.

Of course, whether he would or not... who cares!

Su Yu laughed, "Maybe you will turn against me, but it's okay. If you do, I'll find a chance to kill you. At this time, it's quite simple, after all... you're a bit stupid, easier to scheme against!"

Damn your ancestors!

Martial Emperor couldn't help but curse inwardly. What do you mean by that? Who are you looking down on? What do you mean it's easier to scheme against me? Su Yu, you wretch!

Martial Emperor gritted his teeth. If I ever get unsealed, you'll be in for a surprise. Cooperation... well, it's not impossible. But just because you say cooperate, does that mean I have to? I should weigh my options, maybe shop around a bit. But really, is there anyone more shameless, more brazen, more cunning than Su Yu in the Myriad Realms right now?

Su Yu schemes against people day in and day out. To be honest, Martial Emperor had witnessed it firsthand several times. Like when Su Yu schemed the East Heavenly King to death, and back then, Su Yu wasn't even in the Dao Integration Realm. Or when he plotted against Marquis Longxue and others, or when he drove the Lord of the Undead to despair. Martial Emperor had seen Su Yu's old tricks of scheming people to death!

It seemed Su Yu knew what he was thinking. With a smile, Su Yu said, "Martial Emperor, how about this? I'll unseal you, consider it a free gift! Once you're unsealed, you can go to the Human Realm and have a chat with Hundred Battle, see if he can help you fend off the Human Emperor and Culture King. Or you could go find the Myriad Races, or even the Control King's lineage. What do you think?"

Martial Emperor was suspicious. "What... do you mean?"

"Isn't that what you were thinking yourself?"

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "I'm just giving you a suggestion, but I'd advise you to be careful. These people might want to kill you!"

Martial Emperor looked at him doubtfully. This brat, Su Yu, actually knew what he was thinking and even suggested he go find others. A conspiracy! It must be!

He looked at Su Yu and said, not meaning it, "I'm not that kind of person. I won't go looking for others!"

Su Yu chuckled, unconcerned. To be blunt, even though he hadn't interacted with Hundred Battle and the others, he knew their personalities. A Master of Laws who comes knocking on the door? Can I trust that? If they don't guard against you, it's a good thing. If they can kill you, they will. If they can't, they'd better stay far away from Martial Emperor.

The Control King's lineage, backed by the Gate of Hell, wouldn't let Martial Emperor join them. After all, Yue Luo and the others had just betrayed them. As for Hundred Battle, at most, he'd exchange a few pleasantries before telling Martial Emperor to get lost. An outsider Master of Laws is actually quite troublesome.

And the Myriad Races... forget it, Martial Emperor wouldn't go there himself! Martial artists look down on the Myriad Races. Well, that's a fact.

But Martial Emperor himself hadn't seen through these things, or rather, he didn't know Hundred Battle and the others well enough.

Su Yu didn't say much more. "After you're out, whether you cooperate with me or not, we can discuss it later! But if you don't cooperate with me, to be blunt, the current situation doesn't allow idle top-tier experts to watch the show. All sides might join forces to kill you first, to eliminate this uncertain factor. Believe it or not, you'll understand sooner or later! You have to choose a side, or form your own faction... provided you can, and someone is willing to follow you!"

Martial Emperor was silent. Who would I recruit? I'm strong, but I've been sealed for countless years. Where would I find people to recruit?

"Then I'll go to the Myriad Races, ask for a Councilor's Order, unseal the passage, and dispel the power of laws in the Myriad Realms. Do you need any other help?"

Martial Emperor grew more worried! This was truly offering help without reason! Just helping me unseal like that, and even agreeing to let me go out and ask around, look around, find someone to cooperate with. Honestly, he was scared. If I go out and find someone else, will you ambush me halfway with your people? That's possible!

So should I go or not? And when unsealing, will Su Yu do something?

The more he thought about it, the more depressed and pessimistic he became. Do I, Martial Emperor, need to fear Su Yu?

"Su Yu!"

Martial Emperor gritted his teeth. "I don't need your help with anything. Just dispel the power of laws in the Myriad Realms!"

Su Yu shrugged. "Alright! You and the Undead Emperor can be unsealed together!"

Fear!

Martial Emperor instantly thought of something and gritted his teeth. "You want him to restrain me?"

Su Yu laughed. "Nonsense, he can't even leave the Death Realm. Restrain your ancestors! I still have to be careful of him stabbing me in the back! Of course, he's smarter than you, so he probably won't do that!"

"Su Yu!"

Martial Emperor was furious. "You keep insulting me. Aren't you afraid I'll come out and fight you to the death?"

"Am I worse than Martial King at insulting? Martial King isn't dead, and you have the nerve to say you'd fight me to the death?"

Stunned!

Martial Emperor was stunned. Yes, Su Yu was just talking. Taishan really did insult him, making him a symbol of shame. Taishan isn't dead, so how can I die with Su Yu?

Thinking of this, he suddenly felt extremely dejected. "Fine! Help me unseal, and I won't trouble you!"

Taishan is still alive!

Su Yu smiled. "Alright, I'll get to work now. But it's very dangerous. I'm going to the Myriad Races, and more than a dozen Heavenly Sovereigns want to kill me! Gathering over 90 Councilor's Orders isn't easy. I've been worrying myself sick for you."

Martial Emperor remained silent. Go to hell! I don't believe you! Well, it seems quite difficult. For a moment, he didn't know what to say.

"Alright, I'm off then!"

Su Yu tore through the void and quickly returned to the sealed land. Martial Emperor watched him run off to whisper with the Undead Emperor, and for a moment, he was filled with worry. What did Su Yu say to the Undead Emperor?

After Su Yu left, Martial Emperor's voice shook the heavens. "That stinky guy, what did Su Yu say to you?"

At this moment, there weren't many strong individuals around. With Su Yu gone, he could shout a few times and even chat with the Undead Emperor over there.

The Undead Emperor's voice echoed faintly. "Nothing much."

"You're lying!"

Martial Emperor cursed. "You stinking bug..."

The Undead Emperor said indifferently, "It's better to keep your mouth clean. I was born in the early Taigu era, in the same generation as the Human Ancestor. You might be my descendant for all I know. If you curse your ancestors, who knows who'll suffer?"

Martial Emperor was taken aback.

The Undead Emperor's voice was indifferent. "You're just a human from the late Taigu era. In terms of seniority, you're far inferior to me! If I'm a stinking bug, and you're my grandson's grandson's grandson... what does that make you?"

Martial Emperor was stunned again. Is that possible?

"Don't you have ancestors?"

The Undead Emperor said coldly, "Can you guarantee that your ancestors have nothing to do with me?"

This... is hard to say.

"Are you human?" Martial Emperor thought of something and asked in surprise, "Were you human before you died?"

"Why not?"

"You..."

Martial Emperor didn't know what to say for a moment. Sometimes it's really strange. Could he really be my ancestor?

This time, he didn't curse anymore, feeling a bit uncertain. "Are you really in the same generation as the Human Ancestor? How is that possible!"

"Why not? When the Death Realm was born, I was already here. Strictly speaking, I'm in the same generation as the Lord of the Undead. Is there a problem?"

It seemed there wasn't a problem.

Martial Emperor felt a bit stifled for a moment. "Then... what did Su Yu say to you? That guy is extremely cunning. Maybe he wants you to restrain me. I'm warning you, don't force me to shatter your undead body!"

The Undead Emperor sneered. "Do you think if he dares to release you, he'd be afraid of you attacking him? Martial Emperor? Big name, but not very smart! Since he dares to release you, even if you rebel, it's within his calculations. Does he need me to restrain you?"

Martial Emperor was completely speechless for a moment, feeling very aggrieved. With no one to talk to, he could only continue chatting with the Undead Emperor. "What about you? Aren't you resisting?"

The Undead Emperor chuckled. "Why resist? I'm just an undead. He said he's willing to appoint me as the Undead King, allowing me to openly unify the Death Realm. Why not?"

Is that so?

Martial Emperor's thoughts flickered, and he said, "He'll kill you sooner or later!"

"Why?"

"If you don't listen..."

"Then I'll just listen, won't I?"

"You... damn it..."

Martial Emperor cursed. Do you have any shame left? Just because he tells you to listen, you listen? Are you a dog?

"You deserve to be beaten to death!"

"Better than living a life worse than death!"

"You're courting death!"

Martial Emperor was furious. "When I get out, I'll kill you first!"

"If I become the Undead King and you kill me... you'll probably die too. Are you sure?"

"I..."

Martial Emperor was going crazy. An undead, stinking and rotten, dared to mock and look down on him. When I get out, I'll kill this bastard first!

"You're just benefiting from my presence, allowing you to be unsealed. Do you know that?"

Martial Emperor wanted to find some sense of superiority. The Undead Emperor said indifferently, "I was promised last time that I could be unsealed at any time. You're the one benefiting from my presence, do you understand?"

Martial Emperor was at a loss for words. I don't believe it! Anyway, at this moment, he was very troubled, very irritable, just very annoyed. He couldn't even win an argument with an undead!

Annoying!

The Undead Emperor laughed. "Do you remember your ancestor's name? What's your surname? Maybe... I'm really your descendant?"

Martial Emperor's face stiffened! Go to hell! You're more likely to be my descendant! He didn't want to reply anymore. If they really had the same surname... forget it, he didn't dare to think about it. Too terrifying.

If this old geezer was really his ancestor, he'd rather kill himself.

Martial Emperor left in a huff, diving into the passage and sealing it instantly, not wanting to chat with this old geezer any longer. His interest in chatting was completely gone.

...

Leaving the Death Realm, Su Yu chuckled.

He heard it!

That idiot Martial Emperor, after being stumped by me, tried to regain face with the Undead Emperor, only to be stumped again. It's best if he stays stumped.

After listening to the martial artist's argument, Su Yu left with a smile.

Martial Emperor... should be manageable.

With the pretense of cooperation, this guy wouldn't mind too much.

"Unseal Martial Emperor and the Undead Emperor, break the barrier between the Upper and Lower Realms, open the Myriad Realms, and let Control King and Hundred Battle face each other directly!"

A good thing!

After all, Martial Emperor and the Undead Emperor would eventually break free. Might as well do it now and gain some favor.

Various thoughts flashed through Su Yu's mind.

As for what to do if the Martial Emperor comes looking for trouble... just kill him. Of course, if it comes to a real fight, the losses might be significant. Better to ambush him instead.

This time, Su Yu didn't return to his own world. He headed straight for the Chaos Mountain, intending to gather some intelligence on the Sin Clan and see if the Dragon Beast had emerged.

---

Chaos Mountain.

The aura was in utter chaos! So many had just died, and the turmoil hadn't settled. The energy was turbulent, and any ordinary cultivator entering would likely explode from the pressure.

Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of the Control King, the aura of Yu Qing and Yue Zhan continued to flare, intimidating all around them. They were also wary of Su Yu and his group launching a surprise attack.

In the void, a portal flickered in and out of existence. The Dragon Beast hadn't emerged yet, but it was close. With Yu Qing and Yue Zhan working together, and the power of laws from the deceased Celestial Sovereigns being absorbed, the Dragon Beast's emergence was only a matter of time.

Su Yu observed from a distance, not approaching. Soon, he flew towards the Human Mountain.

---

In front of the Gate of Hell.

The once bustling area was now deserted. After a fierce battle, only Yue Zhan remained among the Celestial Sovereigns of the Control King's lineage. Most of the Heavenly Kings were dead, except for one survivor, Yu Xi, a direct descendant of Yue Zhan.

Among the Dao Integration experts, only seven or eight survived, barely escaping with their lives. This was the once mighty Saint Clan, considered the foremost power!

Fortunately, they still had Yu Qing.

At this moment, Yu Qing's expression was cold and severe. She seemed to sense Su Yu's presence, spying from the shadows.

With a grim face, she said, "Su Yu is nearby!"

Yue Zhan's face was equally grim as he muttered, "Does he intend to strike again?"

Yu Qing suspected as much but couldn't be certain.

She said in a deep voice, "Ignore him! As long as we don't leave, he won't dare come here. If he causes any more chaos, the Dragon Beast will soon emerge!"

Behind the gate, the Dragon Beast struggled and roared, "If he dares to come, I'll be the first to devour him!"

Yu Qing said nothing more.

She turned to Yue Zhan, "Why did Yue Luo and Yue Xiao side with the Hundred Battle King?"

How would Yue Zhan know!

If he did, this wouldn't have happened!

Yue Zhan hesitated before saying, "Perhaps... perhaps Yue Luo had some dealings with the Hundred Battle King."

Nonsense!

Yu Qing cursed inwardly, then quickly said, "Let's not talk about that. When can you truly overcome this barrier?"

Yue Zhan wasn't truly a master of the rules.

Yue Zhan frowned, "The Human Emperor sealed the River of Time, and Chaos has long been sealed. No matter which path we take, it's difficult to truly break through! Unless... I break through behind the gate and then find an opportunity to emerge!"

"Behind the gate?"

Yu Qing frowned, hesitating, "Is it really impossible to break through here?"

Yue Zhan nodded, "Look at the Chaos Dragon. If it were possible, it and the Eight-Winged Tiger wouldn't have rebelled, seeking the Chaos Will from you! In truth, Chaos is already behind the gate. Outside the gate, it's probably impossible to break through!"

Yue Zhan sighed, "I originally thought the Chaos Path wouldn't be restricted, but it turns out... it is! If I had known..."

But there seemed to be no other way!

No matter which path, the result was the same.

Chaos was sealed!

This was different from what Su Yu had anticipated. If the Chaos Path could truly become a master of the rules, Yue Zhan would have broken through long ago, as would the Chaos Dragon. Both were practically at the level and realm of true masters of the rules, but they were just a step away!

They could never cross that line!

Suddenly, he looked at Yu Qing, whose face changed slightly. She transmitted a message, "No! Do you want to start a war with the Ancient Chaos Clan? The Chaos Will, the Eight-Winged Tiger, and the Chaos Dragon can have ideas about it, but you cannot! Don't even think about it!"

She immediately understood Yue Zhan's intention!

He also wanted to devour the Chaos Will!

Yue Zhan was also on the Chaos Path.

Yue Zhan transmitted, "Senior Sister, we could claim it was stolen..."

"Foolish! If you break through, who would believe it was stolen? Besides, the Dragon Beast will soon emerge. Do you want to offend it? The Chaos Will is formed by the powerful beings behind the gate...”

"It's useless!"

Yue Zhan was somewhat gloomy, "The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon are uncontrollable. This thing is just a waste! Since it's a waste, why not use it to help me break through? Once I break through, with the Dragon Beast out, we three masters of the rules will fear nothing!"

It's a waste!

The Chaos Will was originally meant to control those ancient beasts, but now?

Isn't it useless?

Might as well let me use it!

Yu Qing frowned, transmitting, "You don't understand! It's actually a guide! The Chaos Will is also a positioning coordinate. Otherwise, do you think those ancient beasts would leave it with me? The Dragon Beast's emergence is also related to this! If it truly gets lost, the Dragon Beast will find it difficult to find the correct path through the Gate of Hell!"

As for controlling the ancient beasts, that was just a secondary function!

Yue Zhan was stunned, so that's how it is!

Then this thing indeed couldn't be easily tampered with.

But he was unwilling!

He also wanted to break through!

If he couldn't use this, he could only break through behind the gate or wait for the Gate of Hell to open and the chaos to surge before breaking through.

The Gate of Hell sealed the chaos.

It also sealed the possibility of achieving the Dao in the future!

Yue Zhan was momentarily at a loss. The once mighty Saint Clan had suddenly declined, and he found it hard to accept.

He wanted to break through!

Meanwhile, Yu Qing fell silent. If possible, she would have given this to Yue Zhan, but that was impossible. Otherwise, it would mean turning against the powerful beings behind the gate.

She quickly transmitted, "Don't worry. The Holy Master has already ventured deep into the chaos. Perhaps soon, the portal will be fully opened, releasing the Chaos Era. Then, everything will be simple!"

"The Holy Master... is opening the portal?"

"Yes!"

Seeing that he no longer mentioned it, Yu Qing quickly said, "The Holy Master has already reached an agreement with the powerful beings in the chaos. The Holy Master will assist them in completely breaking open the Gate of Hell! And these powerful beings in the chaos will temporarily respect our Saint Clan!"

Alright!

This time, Yue Zhan stopped thinking about it, unable to contain his excitement. He transmitted, "Then can the other senior brothers and sisters come out?"

"They are cooperating with the Holy Master! Once the Holy Master emerges, the heavens will still belong to our Saint Clan!"

Yue Zhan nodded, filled with anticipation.

---

While they were full of expectations, Tiangu and his group didn't look too pleased.

Su Yu had returned!

At this moment, outside the Human Mountain, Su Yu wore a bright smile. Upon seeing them, he got straight to the point, "Give me the Councilor Tokens! I need them to open the passage and connect the Upper and Lower Realms, letting the Hundred Battle King and Yu Qing face off directly!"

Tiangu frowned slightly, "Open the passage between the Upper and Lower Realms completely?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu smiled, "What, can't do it?"

Tiangu said solemnly, "What if the Hundred Battle King joins forces with them? Wouldn't that be more troublesome?"

Su Yu laughed, "What are you afraid of? Then I'll join forces with you, how about that?"

Tiangu fell silent.

If you join forces with the Hundred Battle King, you might as well wipe us out!

None of you are good people!

But... if we don't give them, does Su Yu have no other way?

This guy clearly has other means to enter and exit the Upper and Lower Realms. Yue Luo and the others fled into the depths of chaos, perhaps they can also connect inside and outside.

Thinking of this, Tiangu sighed, "We can give them to you!"

"Smart choice!"

Su Yu laughed, "Don't look so worried. Don't be afraid. I'm protecting you. Before Doubao eats you, how could I let you die? Wouldn't that be a disservice to the Fate Emperor's prophecy!"

Tiangu's face changed slightly!

Su Yu chuckled, "Why are you looking at me? You and Doubao... have a grudge! Or rather, you don't know, and Doubao doesn't know either, but eating you has almost become an obsession. Doubao is actually a manifestation of the rules, and in life, it was also a master of the rules. Do you really have a feud with Doubao?"

Tiangu frowned slightly, looking at Su Yu, and said solemnly, "It's him who keeps pestering me!"

What grudge does he have with Doubao?

But come to think of it, since ancient times, Doubao has been obsessed with eating him, which is strange!

Tiangu pondered, then said solemnly, "We'll talk about this later! We can give you the Councilor Tokens, but please, Emperor Yu, teach me how to break the seal?"

Su Yu laughed, "You're really obsessed! Breaking the seal... soon! Don't worry, everyone wants to break the seal, just wait!"

Tiangu gave him a deep look and shouted, "Bring out all the Councilor Tokens!"

Then he added, "Some are with the Demon Clan..."

"Yes, I have most of them, and a few should be with Mo Tianzun!"

Su Yu laughed, "No problem, I'll get them. He's currently with the Demon Clan, with nowhere to hide in the Upper Realm. Soon, he'll have to go to the Sin Clan, and I'll get them. If he doesn't give them... unless he wants to die!"

Tiangu had nothing to say.

Su Yu had been domineering from the Lower Realm to the Upper Realm. Sometimes, he truly envied Su Yu.

Soon, nearly thirty Councilor Tokens were in Su Yu's hands.

After obtaining them, Su Yu quickly said, "Lie Kong Marquis, are you leaving?"

On the mountain, the Space Ancient Beast Race's Lie Kong Marquis was stunned. Su Yu smiled, "Your partner asked me to save you. Are you leaving? If so, take your people with you! As for the Hou Race, they're too weak. If they don't leave, they'll really die! As for the Fate Clan, forget it, Tianming, protect yourself!"

At this, the myriad races turned green!

What was this?

He was directly taking people away!

Tiangu took a deep breath and said solemnly, "Let them go! If they want to leave, do it quickly!"

It's better if they leave, the myriad races will be cleaner!

It would be best if Tianming and Leibo also took their people and left, that would be ideal!

On the mountain, Lie Kong Marquis no longer hesitated, quickly leading a group of Space Ancient Beasts, flying out with some peculiarity. Just like that... they left?

So simple!

In the distance, a small group of the Hou Race looked towards their only Dao Integration expert, wondering if they should leave.

That Dao Integration expert hesitated, "There's news from the Lower Realm, our race..."

"The Hou Pseudo Emperor?"

Su Yu chuckled, "You think I killed him? Why would I? The Hou Pseudo Emperor is living quite comfortably now. Are you leaving or not? If not, I'm out of here!"

The Hou Race expert hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and roaring, "My clan, retreat!"

Leave now!

The colossal mountain of the Myriad Races seemed on the verge of collapse. If not now, then when?

Moments later, Su Yu led the experts of the two races away swiftly. Meanwhile, on the mountain, Fate looked awkward. "He did it on purpose. I have nothing to do with him!"

The crowd from Tiangu's side couldn't be bothered to respond. Did he really think they were blind?

Tiangu, however, was pondering what Su Yu was up to this time. Was he planning to unseal the Upper and Lower Realms?

"Unseal the Martial Emperor?"

He murmured, thoughts swirling in his mind. He quickly recalled Su Yu's previous words. Could it be that there was truly a grudge between him and Doubao?

Doubao had been consuming his obsessions for many years. Sometimes, things were just that strange. Since Doubao had always wanted to consume him, and this desire had persisted from ancient times to the present, there might indeed be something unknown at play.

Tiangu grew increasingly melancholic. In the future, perhaps a confrontation was inevitable. Was he destined to die in Doubao's maw? That was not an outcome he wished to see.

He stopped dwelling on it, feeling somewhat disinterested. As he walked, he said, "Once the Upper and Lower Realms open, Thunderstorm, you should take your people and leave."

Thunderstorm's expression shifted slightly, and he replied awkwardly, "Tiangu, my friend, those words..."

"If you don't leave... then stay!"

Tiangu's voice was calm, "The Myriad Races still have the strength to fight. Does Brother Thunderstorm truly believe we cannot annihilate the Giant Race?"

Thunderstorm was left speechless. After a long pause, he finally said, "And Fate..."

Marquis Fate glanced at him indifferently, as if to say, why do you care about me? I'll leave if I want to. If not, Tiangu can't do anything about it!

Tiangu was clearly more afraid of Su Yu. If he couldn't see that, he was a fool!
