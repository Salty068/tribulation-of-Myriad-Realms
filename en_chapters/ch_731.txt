Chapter 731: A Gathering of Talents

Within the River of Time.

Su Yu gazed at the Great Zhou King, who took a deep breath. A series of divine characters flew out as he spoke, "The path of endurance has countless branches. Unifying them might offer some insights for Emperor Yu, preparing for the eventual unification of myriad paths."

Su Yu chuckled, "What unification of myriad paths?"

The Great Zhou King also smiled, "Your Majesty knows."

"I don't."

"Your Majesty knows."

The Great Zhou King was speechless. What was this about? Did he think I was blind? Isn't your Mark of Civilization precisely for the unification of myriad paths? My vision, Zhou Tianqi's vision, is top-notch. How could I not see it?

Su Yu laughed again, a meaningful smile on his face. "Have you ever seen the true unification of myriad paths?"

"No."

After the Great Zhou King replied, he saw Su Yu staring at him and had no choice but to explain, "The Human Emperor once discussed it with the Culture King. The concept of unifying similar paths was mentioned during that conversation."

The Great Zhou King elaborated, "The unification of myriad paths is likely the ultimate pursuit of every top-tier genius and supreme expert!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "But not necessarily. The master of the Death Path is specialized! Too much greed can lead to failure. Unifying myriad paths, if done improperly, can be disastrous. However, the master of the Death Path is quite bold, focusing solely on one path!"

To focus solely on one path and reach such heights is indeed terrifying.

The Great Zhou King nodded, and the two continued forward with the divine characters.

As they moved upstream, the Great Zhou King continued, "However, looking further into the future, specialization may not surpass breadth! Just like the difference between the Death Path and the River of Time. The River of Time should represent the unification of myriad paths, right?"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "Indeed, the Human Emperor's writings are insightful. You're right."

The Great Zhou King chuckled dryly, "I was just speaking casually, not comparable to Emperor Yu."

Su Yu glanced at him, smiling, "The Great Zhou King is truly modest! But it's understandable. You're close to the Human Emperor, dealing with top-tier rulers of laws. Your insight can't be poor. I'm just curious..."

"What is Your Majesty curious about?"

"I'm curious why you chose the path of endurance."

Su Yu smiled, "You're skilled in many areas, like the path of silence... Of course, that path might not be very powerful. But I know you're adept in the path of space, which surely has limitless potential! I'm curious why you didn't specialize in the path of space. Becoming a Heavenly King wouldn't be difficult. With your wisdom, if you focused on the path of space, your achievements now might not be low."

Being chosen by the Culture King to handle certain matters, the Great Zhou King must have capabilities.

He wouldn't be unaware of which path has greater potential.

The Great Zhou King was silent for a while, then suddenly smiled bitterly, "If I said... it was due to an accident, would Your Majesty believe me?"

"An accident?"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "To be honest, some things were indeed accidental. The path of endurance, in my view, isn't bad and suits me. My initial thought was to master the path of endurance first, step into the realm of rulers of laws, and then, whether to unify the path of endurance or master other great paths, it wouldn't delay."

The Great Zhou King shook his head, sighing, "Who knew, later on, the ancient upheaval occurred, and rulers of laws became a thing of the past! The path of endurance was a minor path. Even if I comprehended it fully, my strength remained limited, unable to advance further!"

Su Yu understood, "You mean you wanted to become a ruler of laws first, then broaden the path of endurance to encompass other similar paths?"

"Something like that."

The Great Zhou King nodded, "As I mentioned before, similar types of paths are generally in the same region."

He looked at Su Yu, smiling, "To be clearer, take the path of the physical body. The human race's path of the physical body is actually a convergence of countless types of physical body paths. No path is inherently strong upon creation; they all expand and strengthen over time."

Su Yu understood, "So, the path of the physical body actually absorbed all types of physical body paths to become what it is now. Your idea was to first master a path of endurance, then, like the path of the physical body, develop a powerful path of endurance."

Saying this, Su Yu stroked his chin, smiling, "In that case, the Death Path might have started as a small path, then absorbed all types of death paths, converging into a top-tier path. Eventually, the master of the Death Path, with this path, partially detached from the River of Time..."

Stroking his chin again, Su Yu smiled, "So... I'm pondering a question. For instance, can the human race's path of the physical body merge with the myriad races' path of the physical body?"

The Great Zhou King looked at him, silent.

Su Yu mused, "If possible, that would be interesting! You mentioned that similar types of paths can merge. Does that mean all physical body paths are similar? If so, it implies that the Great Qin King's Desolate Beast physical body path could potentially reverse-absorb the human race's physical body path, right?"

"......"

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, "Your Majesty can ponder this. I don't know."

I just mentioned it, and you've connected so many dots. What more can I say?

Su Yu didn't mind, smiling brightly, "So, myriad races and myriad paths might all be interconnected, eventually forming a closed loop!"

"This closed loop becomes the current River of Time!"

"Just like a social network, I know you, you know the Human Emperor, the Human Emperor knows the Culture King, the Culture King knows the Martial King, the Martial King knows Marquis Lanshan, and Marquis Lanshan knows me... In this way, through different people, completely unrelated individuals can be connected."

"Just like this great path!"

Su Yu laughed, his smile radiant, "So, when unifying myriad paths, perhaps such a social network needs to be established! What connection does the path of fire have with the path of water? Water with earth? Earth with wind? One link connects to another, ultimately weaving and interlacing the entire myriad paths, forming a new path. Is that it?"

The Great Zhou King was speechless!

Su Yu nodded, "I understand! Thank you, Great Zhou King, for the reminder."

The Great Zhou King looked weary!

What exactly did I remind you of?

I just started the conversation, and then you began speaking, thinking, and now it sounds like you even have a concept for unifying myriad paths.

You, Su Yu, are always like this.

Others say one thing, and you understand it, but what you understand is completely different from what we said!

Yet, after listening to Su Yu, the Great Zhou King found it very reasonable.

This was somewhat unreasonable!

Su Yu didn't care about him. As long as he understood, that was enough.

At this moment, Su Yu kept thinking, following the Great Zhou King as they moved forward, speaking as they walked, "Great Zhou King, your concept is very reasonable! Previously, when I studied the path of chaos, I pondered how to unify myriad paths when they are so diverse? How to achieve complete unification?"

"Now, I understand. It's not about simply analyzing the components of the great path, but about integration! Inclusion!"

"Big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp, and in the end, the core great path remains!"

Su Yu was somewhat excited, "Yes, that's it! For example, the path of endurance, with countless forms, once you unify them, it becomes a single path of endurance. Within endurance, wouldn't there be a part of silence? For instance, you make someone endure without speaking, isn't that a form of silence? Then later, you can use silence-related paths to merge... Silence is a form of the path of confinement, right? Then you can use the path of confinement to devour... This is an endless nesting doll, and in the end, all paths can be nested together!"

"Brilliant!"

Su Yu marveled, "The Great Zhou King is indeed knowledgeable, pointing out the core of unifying myriad paths. Impressive!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King remained silent, almost shedding tears.

I didn't say that!

Really!

It's all your imagination.

And Su Yu wasn't being sarcastic or mocking. He genuinely felt enlightened.

Sometimes, all it takes is a spark of inspiration.

And Su Yu, at this moment, was inspired, his creativity sparked, constantly thinking, finding the Great Zhou King's words very reasonable. In this way, unifying myriad paths wouldn't result in a mishmash!

It's not just about simply combining great paths!

It's about integration!

This would undoubtedly be of great help for his future path creation.

"I should establish a research institute to have people deduce the connections between myriad paths, forming a closed chain!"

Su Yu said, suddenly inhaling, "I understand, this is akin to acupoints. 720 acupoints ultimately form the Heaven Gate! But with 720 acupoints, there are countless combinations. So, unifying myriad paths... How many possibilities are there? How many deductions are needed to form a complete closed loop?"

Su Yu was astonished, "No, I fear I can't complete this task alone. I must call on others to do the preliminary integration and deduction for me!"

A research institute must be established.

At this moment, Su Yu realized this might require countless manpower, resources, and intellect to deduce, cultivating the path, akin to solving a mathematical problem with infinite possibilities.

The Great Zhou King silently shed tears in his heart.

Whatever you say!

After all, I just started the conversation.

At this moment, the two continued forward. This time, not too far, past the path of the physical body, the Great Zhou King's divine characters stopped. The Great Zhou King glanced around and said, "Your Majesty, it's here."

Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, looking to both sides.

Soon, he saw several small tributaries, none too large, but in this area, there were five or six tributaries.

He then looked at the Great Zhou King's divine characters. Several divine characters were vaguely connected to some tributaries, with the strongest connection to one particular tributary, corresponding to a powerful divine character.

"Endurance, Patience, Suppression, Peace..."

Su Yu glanced at the Great Zhou King's divine characters, smiling, "You've outlined many divine characters of the same type. The strongest is this 'Endurance' divine character, which has formally stepped into the peak of the Daofuse Realm. The remaining ones are all at the Eternal stage. Which two paths are you planning to connect now?"

"Endurance!"

At this juncture, the Great Zhou King didn't say much. Su Yu had a clearer view than he did, so he directly said, "Connect the two paths of Endurance and Forbearance!"

The Great Zhou King spoke solemnly, "I had some ideas back then. After mastering the Path of Forbearance, I wanted to expand it to cover the Path of Endurance. But now, I can't control it, so I can't expand it. My idea is to construct a tributary between these two paths... Do you think it's feasible, Your Majesty?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "It's feasible. Where do you plan to construct this tributary?"

As he spoke, Su Yu placed a small Heaven Gate on the Great Zhou King's forehead.

The Great Zhou King took a careful look, and after a moment, he said, "It can be constructed anywhere, but if it's outside the River of Time, I'm worried it might be destroyed. So, my idea is to build it within the River of Time!"

He continued, "There are intervals between each tributary. I want to clear some of these intervals. These intervals are actually parts of the Path of Forbearance, and they are also insights... I want to clear them, which is essentially like opening a path, but not a long one. I just need to open a small area that can connect the two paths."

Su Yu nodded, "That's a good idea. Can you do it?"

"I should be able to, but I'll still need Your Majesty's help."

"How can I help you?"

Su Yu looked at him. Everyone's understanding of the Great Dao was different, and Su Yu didn't know how to specifically assist him at the moment.

The Great Zhou King understood this and, after a moment of silence, said, "I will open the path to connect the two paths, but at that time, I don't need the power from the River of Time. I just need the two paths to communicate... What Your Majesty needs to do is help me build a dam to prevent the river water from the River of Time from flooding into the small channel I open."

Very straightforward!

He wanted to open a small channel but didn't want the water from the River of Time, just the two small rivers to communicate with each other.

Su Yu's mouth twitched at this, "You... want me to help you build a dam in the River of Time?"

The Great Zhou King smiled broadly and nodded, "Yes, just like that. Simple, right? I don't even need you to worry about it!"

But Su Yu felt a headache coming on. He looked at him, "Are you sure? The water from the River of Time is incredibly powerful. You want me to stop it from flooding into your small channel?"

"Yes!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "Your Majesty doesn't need to hold it for too long. Once I successfully open it and the two paths are connected, you can let go."

Su Yu looked at him for a while, "So, I'm just a human sandbag, holding it for you, and once you're done, I can leave?"

"Well... sort of."

The Great Zhou King smiled humbly, "Your Majesty... this shouldn't be too difficult, right?"

Get lost!

Su Yu wanted to curse!

The water from the River of Time is not that easy to intercept!

Damn it!

Su Yu frowned at him. This wasn't simple. Connecting two paths, the Great Zhou King's idea... one had to admit, was quite imaginative. But in this era, without becoming a master of the rules, merging two paths might be his only way to break through the boundaries.

Su Yu measured the distance between the two paths. From his perspective, they were only a few hundred meters apart.

The Great Zhou King wanted to open a channel between these two paths, and Su Yu needed to block the water from the main river of the River of Time from falling into it.

The Great Zhou King added, "Your Majesty, I specialize in the Path of Forbearance. I can't let the mixed power of myriad paths flood in, or it will cause interference. I'm afraid I won't be able to merge the two paths, so Your Majesty must ensure that not a single drop of river water falls in to prevent interference from the Great Dao! And such a delicate task can only be done by Your Majesty, who has opened the Heaven Gate."

Su Yu asked seriously, "What if interference occurs? What if the river water falls in?"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Then I'll have to give up on merging the paths and wait for a chance to become a master of the rules before trying again."

Su Yu asked solemnly, "If you merge the two paths, do you think you'll have difficulty entering the Heavenly King Realm?"

"No."

The Great Zhou King smiled, "Merging the two paths will give me greater potential. Crossing into the Heavenly King Realm shouldn't be a problem, and even reaching the so-called Heavenly Sovereign Realm isn't impossible. Two paths are definitely stronger than one."

Su Yu took a deep breath, "I can't guarantee there won't be any problems! You have a clear understanding of your Great Dao and a certain future. I'm not you, so I won't give you advice... Since you want me to build a dam... fine, but I'll need the Starry Sky Seal and the Human Lord Seal. I've left them at the Culture King's Residence! If I'd known it would be this difficult, I would have brought them... never mind, I'll go get them now. Wait here!"

"Your Majesty..."

The Great Zhou King looked at him expectantly, "Your Majesty... you can't just leave and not come back!"

Seeing his expression, Su Yu felt he might really abandon him.

It's difficult, but isn't there no other way?

Su Yu felt a bit nauseous and angrily said, "Don't imitate Blue Sky. One Blue Sky is enough!"

Damn it, why are these guys so disgusting now?

That look made Su Yu feel like he was abandoning someone.

Why are these old men so disgusting?

The Great Zhou King quickly retracted his expression. I'm not Blue Sky.

Su Yu snorted and left through the air.

After he left, the Great Zhou King regained his composure, glanced at the River of Time, and soon cast his gaze upstream, looking into the distance, as if seeing something far away, and sighed softly.

At the end of that, perhaps... the Human Emperor is there.

However, people like them have no way to participate in anything.

Even Su Yu, bold and powerful, who once said he would attack the Upper Realm, never mentioned actively going against the current to participate in that great battle, because there, dozens or even hundreds of rule masters are present, and anyone who goes will die!

With small arms and legs, they can only play around here.

...

The Great Zhou King didn't wait long.

Su Yu returned once more.

This time, he had taken the Human Lord Seal and the Starry Sky Seal. As for Fat Ball, Su Yu had sent it back to suppress the Culture King's Residence to prevent it from collapsing.

"Let's begin!"

Su Yu didn't waste words and quickly said, "You open a bit, and I'll help you block a section. Be quick! This is also like opening a path. It depends on how deep your understanding is. If it's deep, you can open it quickly, and I can withdraw quickly. Otherwise, I won't be able to hold on for long!"

"Alright!"

The Great Zhou King was straightforward, and without another word, he directly crossed the river, instantly entering the tributary, which was the Path of Forbearance.

Boom!

With a loud noise, the tributary of the Path of Forbearance suddenly bulged, extending from the root to one side. The Great Zhou King aimed to connect it to the Path of Endurance.

The opening was swift, and in an instant, a gap of one or two meters appeared.

And the water from the River of Time began to fall, rushing towards the gap.

Su Yu also shouted, and the Starry Sky Seal and Human Lord Seal erupted simultaneously, suppressing the river, with his entire body bursting with the power of laws.

The river water that was about to flood down was forcibly suppressed by Su Yu, and the Great Zhou King quickly opened the path. His understanding of the two paths of Forbearance and Endurance was profound, and he opened it quickly. As far as he opened, Su Yu suppressed.

Gradually, Su Yu began to struggle.

The Great Zhou King's speed of opening also slowed down.

Su Yu was helpless!

Don't let this be another Blue Sky incident; I can't handle another one.

After a while, they were halfway through.

Opening a path represents understanding the Great Dao, not just forcibly breaking through.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was clearly struggling.

While opening, he fell into contemplation, obviously pondering deeper insights as he opened.

Su Yu couldn't disturb him and continued to hold on.

After a while, the Great Zhou King continued.

Su Yu continued to suppress more river water, the immense pressure making him feel like vomiting blood.

Not a single one is worry-free!

Each one, opening a path, is a troublesome affair.

Looking back now, Old Wan was still the best. When he opened a path, Su Yu didn't have to do much.

After a while, they were about two-thirds through. Seeing that they were about to connect to the Path of Endurance, the Great Zhou King suddenly flew out, leaving Su Yu dumbfounded. Damn, what are you doing?

"Your Majesty, I'm a bit stuck... I'll try opening from the Endurance side."

"..."

Are you kidding me?

Su Yu gritted his teeth, "Hurry up! I can't hold on much longer!"

The Great Zhou King chuckled dryly and quickly rushed into the Path of Endurance.

This time, starting from the beginning, the speed was a bit faster, and Su Yu continued to suppress both sides. In fact, at this moment, Su Yu was almost bearing the suppression of the river water in all areas, panting heavily from exhaustion.

The Great Zhou King continued to open, and this time it was quick, opening about a quarter.

The entire channel had less than 10% left unopened.

And the Great Zhou King's speed slowed down again.

Su Yu gritted his teeth, damn it, can you do it or not?

Seeing your confidence, I thought you'd connect it quickly.

Not a single one is worry-free!

The Great Zhou King continued to open, and Su Yu measured, 8%, 7%, 5%...

Finally, about 3% remained unopened.

The channels opened from both sides were just a bit short of connecting.

Su Yu, being a peerless genius, immediately understood that this person probably couldn't comprehend some part of the Great Dao in the middle, which was why it couldn't be opened.

Su Yu sighed, and the faint power of the Book of Time began to ripple, suppressing the river water.

He had to use the Book of Time a little!

Otherwise, Su Yu really couldn't hold on.

Damn Great Zhou King, when will you finish comprehending?

...

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was also solemn.

He felt that his understanding of the Path of Forbearance was already profound, and he had thought he could complete the opening quickly.

But now, the Great Zhou King was lost in thought.

His insights were exhausted.

The Path of Forbearance still wasn't open.

Something was missing?

"What's missing?"

The Great Zhou King pondered silently.

He sat cross-legged in the channel he had opened, thinking about what was missing in the Path of Forbearance.

Why couldn't he open that little bit in the middle?

This meant his understanding wasn't complete.

The Great Zhou King closed his eyes, deep in thought. At this moment, he ignored everything else, focusing solely on the path of endurance. He could endure and lie low, disregarding all other matters.

Meanwhile, Su Yu was also observing from above, feeling an urge to curse. He knew that the Great Zhou King was in trouble—just a little more was needed! Su Yu quickly pondered, wondering if the Great Zhou King's path of endurance was still immature. Why couldn't he break through?

As he thought, the pressure mounted, becoming unbearable. He couldn't hold back any longer. "Try exploding!" Su Yu shouted.

The Great Zhou King, startled, looked up at Su Yu with a hint of confusion. Su Yu yelled, "Endure, endure, but must you always endure? Endurance is for a better explosion! If you keep enduring without release, you're no different from a pig! When you can't endure anymore, explode! You're good at enduring, but you need to explode to gain something. Without explosion, how are you different from a rock?"

The Great Zhou King's eyes flickered. Endurance and explosion were two entirely different concepts. Was it time to explode on this path of endurance? He wasn't sure if Su Yu was right, but he felt the pressure from Su Yu, even sensing a tendency to burn his lifespan.

Taking a deep breath, the Great Zhou King thought, maybe... maybe he had endured too much. Was endurance truly for a better explosion? He didn't know, but he had to try.

In the next moment, the usually calm Great Zhou King was filled with a murderous aura, like a powder keg ignited. Boom! He seemed to explode. What happens when endurance reaches its limit? At this moment, the Great Zhou King showed everyone that when endurance reaches its peak, it results in an extreme explosion, filled with boundless anger and killing intent.

In the channel, the last bit that hadn't been opened was instantly breached. The Great Zhou King's eyes widened in fury, and in an instant, he connected the channels between the two paths. Boom! The waters between the two great paths began to merge.

The Great Zhou King's aura visibly strengthened, rapidly switching between two extremely contradictory qualities: endurance and explosion. This rapid transformation was akin to a split personality.

Seeing this, Su Yu breathed a sigh of relief. The old guy finally succeeded. If he hadn't, Su Yu was ready to flee—he didn't have much lifespan to burn for him. Quickly withdrawing his seal, Su Yu leaped onto the River of Time.

Meanwhile, on the Great Zhou King's side, the water in the River of Time stopped falling, as the channel was now filled with the power of laws from the path of endurance. Boom! With a loud noise, the Great Zhou King broke through the path, appearing before Su Yu with anger and explosive intent. His aura was much stronger!

Looking at Su Yu, he was now completely different from before, no longer the humble and enduring figure, but one filled with anger. "Your Majesty, thank you!" he said.

"..."

Damn! Why did his thanks sound like Su Yu was his mortal enemy? Su Yu was speechless and could only reply, "It's nothing."

"Your Majesty, are you dissatisfied?" The Great Zhou King's eyes widened in anger. "I'm thanking you, and you're so dissatisfied?"

Boom! The Great Zhou King's powerful aura surged as he stepped forward, glaring, "Your Majesty, do you not accept my gratitude?"

"..."

Damn you! Su Yu knew this old guy seemed to be adapting to his path. The problem was... Su Yu wasn't going to indulge him! In the next moment, Su Yu raised the Starry Sky Seal, instantly suppressing it, and swung his fist at him! He had long been displeased with this guy. You asked for it.

Boom! A fierce battle erupted in the River of Time.

...

The battle lasted seven or eight minutes. When it finally subsided, Su Yu snorted, adjusted his clothes, and coldly said, "Get out!" With that, he stepped into the air and walked back.

Behind him, the Great Zhou King, with a bruised face, no longer angry, returned to his enduring self, lowering his head with a pitiful look, following Su Yu out.

...

The River of Time was torn open again. Su Yu emerged, and soon after, the Great Zhou King followed. Lantian was stunned, looking at the Great Zhou King, then at Su Yu, then back at the Great Zhou King... After a while, he exclaimed, "You... you like this?"

What was with the Great Zhou King's battered expression? In the next moment, Lantian stopped being a little girl and instantly transformed into an old man, looking at Su Yu with tender affection, "Brother Emperor Yu..."

Boom! A punch was thrown!

Su Yu was furious! Was there not a single normal person under his command? He punched Lantian away and then turned to look at the Great Zhou King, who also wore an innocent expression, whispering, "Your Majesty, I just opened my path and am not used to it. He did it on purpose."

We're not the same!

Su Yu glared at him. Just then, Wan Tiansheng walked out in a daze. Seeing Su Yu, he was about to speak when Su Yu angrily said, "Are you that old? Yingwu and the others, who are tens of thousands of years old, still act like young people. Hongmeng, who is hundreds of thousands of years old, transforms into a young man. Are you really that old? Acting like an old geezer, who are you trying to disgust?"

"..."

Wan Tiansheng was utterly confused. What... what did I do wrong? I've maintained this appearance for a long time, naturally. I'm a hundred years old; I'm just an old man.

At this moment, in the hall, others who had finished their insights also listened intently, hearing Su Yu scold, "White beard, white hair, is that so dashing? Acting like an old immortal, who are you trying to disgust?"

"..."

In the hall, the Fate Emperor remained expressionless, his hair turning black. Was Su Yu the only one allowed white hair, not the rest? Disgusted by old men? The Fate Emperor instantly became youthful.

Some other Daofuse cultivators, who had transformed into older appearances, also quietly transformed into young people, becoming handsome men and beautiful women. Su Yu was about to explode! Wan Tiansheng and Lantian had both been beaten. These were his confidants, so it was better to keep a low profile now and not stand out.

When Su Yu stepped into the hall, he was stunned for a moment. The entire hall was filled with young men and women, all looking around twenty years old. It felt like he had entered a gathering of young people. He looked at the Fate Emperor and others, who had previously been old geezers, now suddenly young, making Su Yu feel a bit awkward.

Thinking back to what he had just said to Wan Tiansheng... he was speechless. Damn it! These people were too idle! Feeling a bit powerless and too lazy to say more, Su Yu quickly said, "The Great Zhou King has advanced to Heavenly King, congratulations! Director Wan, what about you?"

Wan Tiansheng looked innocent at this moment. I just got scolded by you, and now you're ready to continue scolding me? He quickly said, "I have gained a lot. Give me some time, ten days... no, three days. Within three days, I'll strive to have the combat power of a Heavenly King!"

Su Yu was surprised. Did he really gain something? Three days? That was acceptable. Su Yu then looked at the Great Qin King, who straightened his face and loudly declared, "Three days! In three days, both the Great Xia King and I will step into the second tier!"

Don't cause us trouble! Su Yu seemed to be looking for trouble! Su Yu was once again surprised. That was quite fast; they must have gained a lot. He then looked at Doubao, who wore an innocent expression on his furry face, "Well... my little guy has reached the Eternal Realm!" He hurriedly raised the small furball. As for himself, it seemed he hadn't gained much insight and was still a bit short of reaching the Heavenly King level.

Next, whoever Su Yu glanced at quickly reported their progress. Su Yu nodded slightly, a bit surprised. They all seemed to have gained a lot.

At this moment, among the crowd, Heavendoom looked aggrieved. Look at me! Notice me! In the next moment, seeing that Su Yu wasn't asking, he was furious, gritting his teeth and shouting, "I'll reach the fourth tier within three days!"

"..."

Su Yu glanced at him and nodded. I see it! Fourth tier... can't I see it? Really! Seeing this, Heavendoom felt cold inside and quickly said, "I... I want to go to the Upper Realm! If I go up and kill a few with my big stick, I'll reach the third tier. I want to go to the Upper Realm!"

Su Yu had said that those below the third tier wouldn't be considered. He wasn't having it! He wanted to go up! Su Yu looked at him and suddenly smiled, "Are you sure? Heavendoom, you've fought so many battles... maybe you should stay in the Lower Realm. In the Lower Realm, you're still top-notch!"

You've never won a fight! Even if you reach the fourth tier, going up might just mean getting beaten. Are you sure you want to keep getting beaten? Maybe it's better to stay in the Lower Realm.

Heavendoom gritted his teeth, feeling deeply hurt. He angrily said, "I want to go to the Upper Realm!" He couldn't hold back anymore! Even Grandstar was stronger than him now. The Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng were both about to or had already reached the Heavenly King level. Hongmeng seemed to have fully entered this realm this time. At this point, if Marquis Huoyun advanced, Su Yu's subordinates would have quite a few Heavenly Kings.

If he didn't keep up, he wouldn't even have a chance to eat dust. Su Yu laughed and quickly said, "We'll see! In three days, I'll announce the list of those going to the Upper Realm this time! Everyone, consolidate your realms well in these three days. This time, when we go up... we won't be weaklings anymore!"

Lantian, the Great Zhou King, Wan Tiansheng, and if Marquis Huoyun could also advance, Doubao... a bit foolish, but still a second-tier peak. Plus, Marquis Yunshui and those about to step into the second tier, along with the Great Qin King and other second-tier Daofuse cultivators. Going up again, Su Yu's side would be extremely formidable!

As for Fat Ball, Su Yu was considering whether to bring it up this time. As for the Culture King's Residence, if it really didn't work out, he could leave his Human Lord Seal here, and with Big Wood's help, it could be suppressed for a while. If he brought Fat Ball up and called on Marquis Giant Bamboo from the Iron Devourer Race...

Su Yu calculated for a while, and the combat power would be much stronger than when they last went to the Upper Realm. There's also the Great Ming King... the Great Ming King had gained a lot in the Ming King's Mansion. Judging by his situation, he might soon step into the third tier, which would be very useful then.

As for Hongmeng, there was no way to bring him to the Upper Realm for now. The Death Realm still needed someone to suppress it. Only at this moment did Su Yu feel that he had a wealth of talent under his command, with strong experts everywhere.

There was also Flatbread, a third-tier Daofuse combatant. Su Yu pondered whether he should bring them along. This family of three had been assisting him for quite some time. Taking them might yield some benefits.

As various thoughts crossed his mind, Su Yu quickly announced, "The list will be released in three days, and in five days, we will ascend to the Upper Realm!"

By then, it would be nearly ten days since his disappearance. He wondered if any significant changes had occurred in the Upper Realm during these ten days.
