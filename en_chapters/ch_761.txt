Chapter 761: The Joy of Opening a Breach (Requesting Subscription)

It was only as big as a bowl!

Su Yu muttered to himself, worried that if he dug too large, he wouldn't be able to stabilize it. Look at the Human Emperor, who dug such a large breach that even the Heavenly Sovereigns couldn't pass through—how dangerous!

Diving into the River of Time, Su Yu swiftly flew forward. This time, Wan Tiansheng and the others would be sorting out the Great Dao below, leaving the task of opening a breach solely to Su Yu.

As he traveled, he mainly relied on the Starry Sky Seal. Nowadays, Su Yu depended more on the Starry Sky Seal than on the Book of Time. If not for obtaining the Starry Sky Seal from Xingyue, opening a breach in the River of Time would have been impossible. Even traversing between the upper and lower realms would have been difficult.

Xingyue...

At this moment, Su Yu thought of Xingyue again. Perhaps Xingyue didn't care about the Starry Sky Seal or had completely forgotten about it, but he still had to remember the favor. This necromancer, who had been dealing with him from the start, was now very low-key, continuing to reside in her necropolis, rarely seen outside. She was a genuine homebody, staying in for tens of thousands of years.

With these thoughts in mind, the Starry Sky Seal continued to exert its power, smoothing the waves of the River of Time, allowing Su Yu, whose Great Dao was severed, to continue his journey.

He didn't know how far he had traveled, almost surpassing the pen dao, when Su Yu sensed the aura of the Abyssal Great Dao.

Soon, a significant tributary appeared before him. Su Yu examined it carefully, judging that this should be the main path of the Abyssal Great Dao. It wasn't particularly strong. The entire tributary spanned about a kilometer, weaker than the pen dao and even less than the Great Dao of the Desolate Beast, naturally inferior to the Martial Emperor's Great Dao.

"The strength of the Abyssal Emperor is just like this!"

Su Yu roughly sensed it. Digging a hole here would suffice, but he needed to lock onto the right position to avoid digging outside the realm, which would be a waste.

Su Yu quickly stopped in front of the tributary, measuring it before landing at the corresponding main path position.

At this moment, the river roared. This river was filled with the power of myriad paths, which would channel the corresponding Great Dao power into those tributaries, providing them with the power of laws. This was the operational mode of the entire River of Time.

Under normal circumstances, even a Heavenly Sovereign would only specialize in one path. If they rashly dived to the riverbed of the River of Time, they would be overwhelmed by its power if delayed even slightly.

The power of myriad paths contained too much, including corrosion, attack, and certain death... and other powers of laws. Such impact was unbearable for anyone.

"I wonder how long the Starry Sky Seal can suppress it!"

Su Yu wasn't sure, as in previous attempts, he had only dabbled briefly, suppressing for a moment before quickly retreating. Now, digging a hole... wouldn't be easy. The River of Time wasn't so fragile that it would break just because you wanted to dig a hole. If it were that simple, the River of Time would have been full of holes long ago.

"Suppress!"

Su Yu didn't think much further and decided to try first. With a loud shout, the Starry Sky Seal erupted with brilliant light. In an instant, the entire River of Time seemed to pause slightly. Su Yu immediately dove to the riverbed, with the Starry Sky Seal forming a protective shield around him.

However, the massive river's power continued to impact Su Yu, making it difficult for him to stabilize. If he were swept away, he would deviate from the Abyssal Realm.

In his mind, the Book of Time rippled slightly. The Mark of Civilization emitted a faint glow. The Human Emperor's Mark of Civilization, the Time Sage's Book of Time, the Starry Sky Seal... these treasures were all exerting their powerful influence at this moment.

Su Yu continued to dive, feeling a bit strained. The river water rushed past him, and Su Yu felt the power of myriad paths, a terrifying convergence of various forces.

He kept diving, unsure how long it took, but it seemed he had reached the bottom. Su Yu looked down, his eyes flickering. This was the first time he had seen the riverbed so clearly.

A barrier!

What was that barrier?

"Chaos!"

Su Yu murmured, yes, chaos! The riverbed of the River of Time was chaos, the power of chaos, a fusion of myriad paths, a mixture of myriad paths.

"So that's how it is!"

"Using chaos as a wrapper, opening one's path, stabilizing the River of Time, chaos outside, myriad paths inside!"

"Impressive!"

Su Yu marveled in his heart. The Great Dao barrier was wrapped in chaos, providing him with many ideas for opening a path.

Su Yu threw a punch, but the riverbed didn't budge. Not even a ripple appeared!

"It's not brute force..."

Su Yu frowned, quickly realizing something, then chuckled bitterly, "Damn!"

He understood a bit now! Digging a hole wasn't about brute force but about sorting out chaos, opening a breach within chaos, akin to analyzing the chaotic path.

"To dig a hole, one must comprehend the Great Dao, understand the Great Dao!"

Chaos was a tangled web. Su Yu needed to sort out this tangled web, then remove some key threads to loosen the net, thus creating a hole.

At this moment, Su Yu thought of the Human Emperor! The Human Emperor opened such a large breach, not through brute force, but because of his deep understanding of the Great Dao, thoroughly analyzing the chaotic path, and then removing the entire chaotic barrier, resulting in such a large breach.

"Impressive!"

Su Yu marveled again. Opening a breach wasn't simple. As far as Su Yu knew, in this tide, only he, Lantian, and Wan Tiansheng had a chance to open a breach. Others probably couldn't, as they lacked deep understanding of the myriad paths and chaos.

"Can Hundred Battle and the others do it?"

Hard to say. After all, digging a hole wasn't about strength but intelligence. When did even digging a hole become a task only cultured people could do? Su Yu sighed again. When would warriors be able to stand up? If they didn't work hard, even digging holes, a task requiring strength, would be beyond them!

"Analyzing chaos... Fortunately, I've studied a lot with Lantian and the others recently. Maybe I can do it."

For the past half month, he had been researching all this with several necromancers, including Lantian. Previously, Su Yu might have been at a loss.

"This is good, a test before I open a path! If I can't even analyze it, how can I talk about opening a path?"

The Great Dao was like a machine. If you couldn't even dismantle it, how could you create it? The chaotic path was a synthesis of myriad paths. Su Yu had to dismantle it first to have a chance to create it. Otherwise, his success rate in opening a path was extremely low!

Su Yu crouched down, ignoring the river's impact outside. The Mark of Civilization and the Starry Sky Seal hovered, suppressing the area. In the short term, there was no problem. If he was swept away, he could just come back. What was there to fear?

"Chaotic barrier, I need to find a thread first, otherwise it's hard to dismantle!"

Su Yu looked at the solid, smooth chaotic barrier, feeling a bit overwhelmed. Where should he start?

"How to draw out a thread?"

This thing really required unraveling, not just a metaphor but a literal unraveling.

"Let's start with the Five Elements!"

In Su Yu's hand, a flame rose, and on the barrier, a flame glow was reflected. Su Yu's flame grew stronger, and the flame path on the barrier also grew stronger.

Su Yu focused his mind, carefully sensing, and had a thought. Forcibly breaking it might be difficult.

"It requires using the Dao to counter the Dao!"

"Water and fire are incompatible, wood generates fire. Use the wood path to nurture the fire path, strengthen the fire path, and use the water path to extinguish the fire path... sever the fire path thread!"

One thought after another arose in Su Yu's mind. He first drew out the fire path, then his wood character divine text erupted, nurturing the fire path, making it stronger. Gradually, the fire path on the barrier became clearer, showing signs of protrusion.

Indeed, it required Great Dao comprehension. Brute force couldn't break the barrier.

The water path appeared! Instantly pouring down!

With a sizzle, the protruding fire path was instantly extinguished by the water path.

"No, I'm too weak."

Su Yu felt overwhelmed. His path was too weak. At this rate, he would need to grind it down slowly. Just breaking one path would require a lot of effort.

When would he be able to grind down all these myriad paths?

"It seems I need to borrow strength!"

The next moment, a page of the water path appeared in the Mark of Civilization. A virtual water path connected with Su Yu.

Then, in his mind, the Book of Time also infused a power of the water path into his body. Su Yu's water path instantly grew stronger, pouring onto the fire path on the barrier again.

Sizzle!

This time, the water path was much more effective. However, breaking this fire path would still take some time.

Su Yu didn't mind. This was a test of his Great Dao comprehension. Even if he couldn't open a breach this time, it was still a test for himself.

"If an opener can't even dig a hole, then there's no way to open the heavens!"

"This is somewhat like an assessment. Failing the assessment means I don't even have the basic qualifications to open the heavens!"

Su Yu continued his slow grind, starting to wear down the fire path.

Around him, a large amount of river water surged, and the Starry Sky Seal shone brilliantly. However, gradually, it also began to dim.

The power consumption was too great!

...

At the same time, deep within the River of Time, a shadow appeared again, suddenly turning back to look into the distance.

"Starry Sky Seal..."

Murmuring, the figure sensed the Starry Sky Seal within the river, perhaps at some point in the future, upstream to the past, downstream to the future.

In the future, someone had brought the Starry Sky Seal into the River of Time, continuously suppressing the river.

What were they doing?

The Starry Sky Seal's power seemed to be depleting rapidly.

"Did Xingyue give the Starry Sky Seal to someone?"

With some doubt, the shadow frowned slightly. Why was it staying in one place without moving?

Strange!

Recently, strange things had been happening more frequently. Last time, there was even a peculiar individual who didn't accept his inheritance.

As he pondered, a figure swiftly approached from the front, exhausted and shouting, "Your Majesty, they've launched another assault! The front lines are struggling to hold!"

The shadow trembled slightly, disregarding the rear. "Hold them back!"

"Your Majesty!" The figure in front urged anxiously, "We should retreat!"

"We cannot retreat!" came the low growl. "Retreat? If we retreat any further, we'll soon be back in the Myriad Realms! The Myriad Realms have not changed; no one has broken the seal to become a master of the laws! With no reinforcements, there is nowhere left to retreat. If we retreat again... the Human Race will surely be defeated!"

"Your Majesty! Perhaps the Culture King and the others have returned..."

"Impossible!" the figure snapped. "If they had returned, they would have come to aid us by now! Listen to my command, advance with full force! The Human Race of the Myriad Realms... what are they doing?"

The last words were barely audible, but the frustration was evident. How many years had it been? Not a single reliable expert had emerged? Not a single useful one? Hadn't I left enough contingencies? If there had been even one reliable person, the Myriad Races would have been conquered by now, and with the Myriad Races under control, producing a few masters of the laws wouldn't have been a problem, right? Not asking for much, but in all these years, if ten or eight masters of the laws had emerged, I could have led the charge back, and there would have been reinforcements. But... the seal remains unbroken. What does that signify? It signifies that not a single master of the laws has appeared! Damn it!

The shadow's heart burned with anger. How could there be so many useless people? Was the Human Race destined to end with my generation? What a nightmare! The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. In the next moment, his voice boomed, "Advance with full force, no more retreating! There's no path behind us, no room to retreat!"

"Understood!" came the resounding reply, and in the distance, battle erupted. Lines of law and order crisscrossed the river of time, its waves surging violently. Behind, the shadow suppressed the waves, for the river's turbulence was too intense, threatening disaster for the rear and impacting the future.

From a distant direction, a cold voice echoed, "It seems the Myriad Realms have yet to produce a master of the laws... Human Emperor, your grand plan has failed!"

"Our return is not far off!"

"Once we return to the Myriad Realms, the decline of humanity will be inevitable, and Human Emperor, your path... will be at its end!"

The grand voice reverberated through the river, tinged with coldness and mockery. Even if blocked for millions of years, so what? Without you, the Human Race of the Myriad Realms remains useless. When we return and break the seal, perhaps the Myriad Races will produce numerous masters of the laws, for they have already sensed it; the Myriad Races' fortune is not low!

The shadow ignored them, though his heart was filled with curses. What was the Human Race doing? The more he thought about it, the more sorrowful he became. In countless ages, had there been no genius? It was too disheartening!

As the shadow pondered, suddenly, he felt a slight movement in his heart and turned to look back again. It wasn't that someone had become a master of the laws, but rather... there seemed to be some disturbance where the Luminous Domain Seal was located. Vaguely... something seemed off. What kind of disturbance? The distance was too great for him to sense clearly. Forget it, forget it, no matter what kind of disturbance, no master of the laws has emerged. Is it truly fate that the Human Race is not destined to rise?

...

Meanwhile.

At the riverbed.

Grinding!

Su Yu continued to grind, grinding for who knows how long, until there was a cracking sound! The protruding Fire Path snapped with a crisp sound!

Su Yu was drenched in sweat, feeling both delighted and helpless.

Damn it! Just one path nearly wore me out. Digging this tunnel is too difficult. I had underestimated this task before. At this rate, how long will it take me to grind through?

"Maybe I don't need to grind through everything. If I break some of the main paths, perhaps the river of time will wash the tunnel open on its own!"

With that thought, Su Yu grinned, "With the Fire Path of the Five Elements broken, the remaining four are unstable. Breaking the Five Elements seems feasible now!"

At that moment, within the river of time, suddenly, a surge of Fire Elemental power separated from the myriad paths, transforming into a stream of Fire Elemental water, rushing towards Su Yu's location, and in the blink of an eye, it entered the broken gap.

Su Yu's heart stirred, and in that instant, the Fire Elemental power vanished.

"Where did it go?"

"Could it have flowed into the Abyssal Realm?"

...

At that very moment.

In the Abyssal Realm.

Everyone was on high alert, waiting silently.

After an unknown period, suddenly, a flame descended from the sky, a flame that could incinerate the heavens and the earth! It seemed like the fire of the apocalypse. It burned without any restraint, extinguishing countless deathly auras. Blue Sky's face changed; this flame's power was too overwhelming, burning without restraint, too powerful.

Wan Tiansheng's expression also changed, and in the next moment, he shouted, "Fire Elemental Race of the Five Elements, step forward and absorb the flames! Those who cultivate the Fire Path, quickly, absorb the Fire Elemental power!"

On the side of the Five Elemental Race, several cultivators of the Fire Elemental Path swiftly flew into the sky. The pure and unparalleled Fire Elemental power left them astonished. Several Eternals quickly absorbed the Fire Elemental power, yet the flames continued to rise madly.

Wan Tiansheng's face changed slightly! No, the power absorbed by the Fire Path was too little. In the next moment, he shook the pages of a book, and tens of thousands of Fire Elemental Race experts appeared, some strong, some weak. These were left to him by Su Yu, who dared not bring everyone into the river of time.

"Fire Elemental Race, absorb the power of the flames! Blue Sky, suppress the intensity of the flames, everyone else... help me suppress the power!"

Wan Tiansheng kept shouting, and in the next moment, his voice echoed through the pages that held fifty million people: "Is there anyone who comprehends the divine character of the Fire Elemental? Anyone who can cultivate the Fire Path? If so, step forward quickly!"

Relying on a few Eternals was completely insufficient to absorb all this Fire Elemental power. Wan Tiansheng's face was serious as he looked up at the sky. What was happening? Why was there only the singular Fire Elemental power seeping through, causing a severe imbalance in power, with the flames burning the sky? At this rate, it would eventually burn the entire Abyssal Realm.

A large number of Fire Elemental experts frantically absorbed this pure and unparalleled Fire Elemental power. It was like a reward from the heavens. The problem was... there was too much of it. So much that it was terrifying, threatening to burst everyone.

On the side of the Five Elemental Race, the Fire Ancestor initially felt elated, but soon turned to terror, looking at the Topsoil Spirit who was absorbing the power with horror, "There's so much, we can't absorb it all!"

The happiest thing in life is absorbing countless corresponding attribute rules of power. The most painful thing in life is also absorbing countless corresponding attribute rules of power, damn it, unable to absorb it all, absorbing so much that you're about to be burned to death!

The Topsoil Spirit was also trembling, so much! A large amount of heavenly fire descended from the sky. What was Su Yu doing? Don't just set fires! There's too much fire, and with the imbalance of power, other experts can't even enter to absorb these flames.

As everyone was frantically absorbing, suddenly, a large amount of heavenly water descended from the sky. Wan Tiansheng's expression changed again, what the hell, wasn't this supposed to be digging a tunnel? How did the power imbalance become so severe! These powers were pure, but the recipients were few. Fortunately, there were quite a few people from the Five Elemental Race.

In the next moment, he shouted again, "Blue Sky, disperse the power of water and fire, Water Spirit Race of the Five Elemental Race, absorb the Water Elemental power, all those who cultivate the Water Path, enter!"

In the sky, Blue Sky couldn't help but curse, "Do it yourself, I'm just one person, do you think I'm a god?"

He wanted to curse! Everything was Blue Sky, did Blue Sky eat your food and drink your water? Tiansheng was not cute at all! Didn't he see that I was busy?

Wan Tiansheng was also frustrated, but there was no choice. Only he and Blue Sky could separate these powers of the Great Dao, everyone else was lacking. With this thought, Wan Tiansheng suddenly shouted, "Marquis Huoyun, are you dead? What are you doing? Come and absorb!"

He was usually polite to these elders, but at this moment, he suddenly remembered, wasn't there a guy on the Fire Path? Where was he?

In the distance, Marquis Huoyun transformed into a shadow, a ball of light flickering, with helplessness, "We have no physical bodies, the power is too fierce, Blue Sky, please dissolve it a bit, make it gentler..."

Damn it! Blue Sky cursed silently, did they all think of him as a filter? Curse as he might, he still quickly began to weaken the Fire Elemental power, acting as a human switch, controlling the strength of the power's seepage.

Seeing this, Wan Tiansheng's eyes lit up, "Blue Sky, go to the sky, block the point of power seepage, act as a switch, adjust the strength of the power release!"

At this moment, Blue Sky was really useful. Blue Sky couldn't hold back any longer and shouted angrily, "If you want to kill me, just say it, what do you think I am?"

"Stop talking nonsense, are you going or not?" Wan Tiansheng was also angry, "Besides you, who else can do it? Don't look at the number of people here, they're all just eating for nothing, haven't you heard of 'the capable do more work'?"

"......"

Around them, a group of experts felt ashamed. Those words... really hit home. We don't want this either! The key is, we're all specialized in one path, who cultivates so many paths?

Blue Sky was helpless, so he had to fly into the sky, shouting angrily, transforming into a giant octopus, blocking the sky! Then, he opened his mouth, spitting out some Fire Elemental power like spitting saliva, and then spitting out Water Elemental power.

Below, everyone's faces stiffened. Marquis Huoyun couldn't help but say, "Friend, this... how about... using another method?" Spitting it out! It's a bit disgusting!

"Poof!" The octopus farted, releasing a large amount of Water Elemental power... Everyone was disgusted! Blue Sky, that bastard, did it on purpose. Yes, he did it on purpose. Who told them to make him the switch, they could absorb it or not.

Wan Tiansheng was also speechless! Truly not a decent person! Forget it, anyway, I'm not absorbing it. "Everyone, don't mind it, it's all pure rules of power, not Blue Sky's saliva or urine..."

If you hadn't said it, it would have been fine, but now that you did... forget it, let's keep absorbing. As he was speaking, boom! A surge of Earth Elemental power seeped through, and Wan Tiansheng vaguely understood, shouting, "Earth Elemental Race, prepare, Emperor Yu is gradually releasing the rules of power, everyone, this is a rare opportunity! Such pure rules of power, if missed this time, there may not be a next time!"

At the moment the opening was made, these powers were very pure, seeping out bit by bit. Afterward, they would probably be mixed. At this moment, the Five Elemental Race was getting a big advantage. Su Yu was releasing the Five Elemental power above, while Blue Sky was controlling the strength of the rules of power seepage below. For them, this was a heaven-sent opportunity! Equivalent to continuous heavenly rewards appearing!

Topsoil Spirit was also frantically absorbing energy. As a Five Elemental powerhouse, he could absorb all five elemental forces, and he was, after all, a manifestation of the origin of the Earth Ancestor. Strictly speaking, the difference between Topsoil Spirit and Doubao wasn't that significant. He could barely be considered a spirit of the Great Dao!

At this moment, his aura surged dramatically. A large amount of the power of laws was absorbed by him, and Topsoil Spirit grinned widely. As expected, following Su Yu had its benefits.

At this moment, numerous experts of the Five Elemental Race were advancing. For the weaker ones, such a massive influx of the power of laws might make their realms somewhat unstable, but it was indeed the best opportunity for advancement! Those cultivating the Five Elemental powers were continuously strengthening.

Marquis Huoyun, a Heavenly King-level expert of the Fire Path, had his shadow solidify instantly as he absorbed a vast amount of fire elemental power. Previously, his physical body had been shattered, but now, he used the fire elemental power to outline a complete fire elemental body.

In the next moment, a weapon appeared in his sea of will. Following that, over ten thousand people appeared, and Marquis Huoyun roared, "Absorb! Everyone, absorb the pure power of fire elemental laws!"

Those people began absorbing, albeit somewhat bewildered.

Where are we?

Wan Tiansheng glanced over and frowned slightly. Marquis Huoyun awkwardly explained, "They're my people, brought from Divine Fire Mountain. I didn't have time to release them earlier! They're all very strong..."

He then looked at a fiery woman among them and shouted, "Huoyue, hurry and absorb, reach Daofuse!"

The fiery woman looked bewildered but didn't hesitate and started absorbing.

Where did all this fire elemental power come from?

And there's water elemental power too, yes, and earth elemental power.

These people were all confused.

However, this place was a hundred times purer than the power at Divine Fire Mountain, indeed a great place for their cultivation. Among these people, there were quite a few Eternals.

Back in the day, Marquis Dingjun had over a thousand subordinates, many of whom were Eternals. Marquis Huoyun had even more Eternals under his command.

In the distance, Marquis Dingjun exchanged glances with a few others, and in the next moment, he shouted, "Chongming, where are our people? Release them quickly, let them absorb!"

Chongming hurriedly released the subordinates of Marquis Dingjun he had brought.

Meanwhile, General Yingwu, without a word, also released a weapon from his sea of will, releasing over ten thousand people. Those cultivating the Five Elemental paths were instructed to absorb!

On that day, six ancient marquises from the Upper Realm descended; Shadow had no subordinates, Yunshui had left, and Su Yu didn't manage Marquis Zhennan's people, as they were all with Marquis Zhennan himself.

At this moment, the combined forces of Marquis Dingjun, General Yingwu, and Marquis Huoyun amounted to nearly thirty thousand people, with over a hundred Eternals among them!

Years of accumulation were now fully displayed on these veteran powerhouses.

A large number of experts began absorbing the Five Elemental powers.

Especially on Marquis Huoyun's side, Huoyue's power was continuously rising.

In the blink of an eye, a loud boom resounded!

The power of the Great Dao instantly grew stronger, and an aura belonging to Daofuse surged up in an instant!

At this moment, General Yingwu sighed.

What a pity!

Not pity for others, but for Marquis Yunshui. If Yunshui were here, he would certainly have a chance to advance to Heavenly King, and many of Yunshui's subordinates, who mostly cultivated the Water Path, might also become powerful water elemental experts.

Advancing to Daofuse was not just a dream.

General Yingwu felt it was a great pity, but it was Yunshui's own choice.

Meanwhile, Marquis Huoyun was grinning so widely it seemed his mouth might split.

This is great!

One of my subordinates has reached Daofuse.

He laughed heartily, "Huoyue, keep it up, continue absorbing! And Huolie, Huobao... all of you, absorb, don't let the Five Elemental Race take advantage, they can't reach Daofuse, let's charge!"

He was extremely excited, and Wan Tiansheng, seeing him shouting incessantly, angrily said, "Shut up! Huoyun, focus more on comprehending the Fire Path, this is your only chance to advance to Heavenly Sovereign!"

This old thing, why so much nonsense!

Hurry up and absorb, comprehend the power of the Great Dao.

Marquis Huoyun had advanced to Heavenly King last time, and this time, if he was lucky, without the interference of a physical body, and by comprehending the Great Dao more, he might enter Heavenly Sovereign. The Fire Path could certainly advance to Heavenly Sovereign.

These foundational Great Daos were all very strong, unlike the minor paths of the Great Zhou King, which might not even reach Heavenly King even if cultivated to the peak.

Huoyue and the others were somewhat bewildered.

However, seeing Marquis Huoyun obediently going to comprehend the Great Dao, the others felt a bit strange but remained silent, quietly absorbing the power.

Why does it feel like our leader's status isn't high here?

Where is this place?

The Lower Realm?

Where does the Lower Realm have so much power of laws, truly strange.

One by one, the fire elemental experts grew stronger, and in the void, the power of the Gold Path emerged again. At this moment, many people were delighted, and Wan Tiansheng also showed a joyful expression, "Quick, warriors can also comprehend, all weapons belong to the Gold Path! The Gold Path, the path of attack!"

This path, even if not specialized in, could be comprehended!

The path of attack, which cultivator hasn't encountered it?

Wan Tiansheng's face lit up with joy, unexpectedly, the opening was like this, if it could be opened every few days... wouldn't that mean... everyone would prosper?

"We're rich!"

"If Su Yu can open the passage, then open it every three days, each time everyone bathes in the power of laws, comprehending various pure Great Daos, even a pile could produce a Heavenly Sovereign!"

Wan Tiansheng thought about these things, feeling a bit strange. If the Human Emperor could open it, why didn't he open more back then?

Opening it every three days, the Human Race wouldn't say they have the master of laws, but at least a large number of Daofuse experts would emerge, right?

...

At this moment, Su Yu was unaware of Wan Tiansheng's thoughts.

Otherwise, he would have cursed Old Wan to death.

Go to hell.

The Five Elemental Paths weren't even fully opened, and Su Yu was already pale-faced. Around him, both the Mark of Civilization and the Starry Sky Seal were trembling madly!

The pressure was immense!

As he ground down some barriers of the paths, various forces surged towards him, and Su Yu himself absorbed a large amount of the power of laws, feeling like he was about to explode.

"So hot!"

"So cold!"

"So painful!"

"Ah, I'm petrified!"

"..."

With no one around, Su Yu kept shouting and cursing.

Next time, I'm not opening the passage again. Once opened, all kinds of Great Dao powers have to pass through, slicing through me a thousand times.

Opening this passage once is life-threatening.

"I opened it weakly, opened it small..."

"Back then, when the Human Emperor opened such a large passage, with so much Great Dao power pouring in, the Human Emperor must have been screaming in agony too!"

Su Yu comforted himself, not embarrassing!

Surely, it's not just me, the Human Emperor must have been crying out in a place where no one could see. I opened it so small, you opened it so big, even if you're strong, you must have cried.

"This is the secret of us pioneers, no one will leak it, yes, definitely!"

Su Yu was almost in tears from the burning, then frozen into an ice block, then saved by the power of wood, moaning in relief, only to have his internal organs shattered by the power of the Gold Path!

Tears streamed down his face!

With no one watching, what's the big deal?

This must be everyone's secret, the Human Emperor won't say, the master of the Death Path won't say, I won't say, who else would know?

The Great Dao was being ground down one by one.

Each time one was ground down, Su Yu experienced a unique sensation.

For instance, when the power of the Demon Path was ground down, Su Yu transformed into a demon, cackling sinisterly.

When the power of the Immortal Path was ground down, Su Yu became ethereal and otherworldly, though he cried and wept, he still exuded an immortal aura.

At this moment, Su Yu was truly experiencing the various powers of the Great Dao, gaining more insights.

Different Great Daos brought different experiences.

It was like role-playing, and at this moment, Su Yu became a man of a thousand faces, somewhat manic, somewhat fervent.
