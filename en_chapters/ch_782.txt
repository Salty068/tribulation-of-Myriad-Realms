Chapter 782: The First Resurrected (Subscription Requested)

Fourteen top-tier experts had just fallen!

At this moment, the aura of the South King grew stronger, as did that of the Death Spirit Giant. Both were Heavenly Sovereign-level beings, advancing toward even higher realms. Simultaneously, the Dragonblood Marquis also silently ascended in rank!

With the fall of these fourteen top-tier experts, the entire Death Realm suddenly quieted down, except for those death spirits whose minds were truly controlled.

...

Within the Death Path.

Su Yu's expression was stern as he faced the giant opposite him. The aura of the Death Spirit Giant grew increasingly powerful, yet his brows furrowed as he looked at Su Yu.

Su Yu also observed him.

After a moment, Su Yu calmly asked, "Are you the full will of the original, or just a remnant? Is the Lord of Death Spirits alive or dead?"

"Life and death?" The giant replied indifferently, "Are you discussing life and death with one who controls death? Don't you find it laughable?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Control death? I admit, the Lord of Death Spirits is immensely powerful, unparalleled in talent, but to claim control over death might be a stretch!"

He didn't deny the Lord of Death Spirits' strength, but controlling death depended on the situation. Could he control the death of top-tier beings? Clearly not! Such a claim was a bit too grand.

The giant couldn't be bothered to respond, thrusting a fork at Su Yu. His aura continued to grow stronger, even beginning to approach Su Yu's level!

In truth, not much time had passed.

As for the deaths of Dizhi Luo and the others, the giant remained indifferent. Death was the nature of this world! Their complete demise only accelerated his revival, so he didn't lose out.

Su Yu's side, the South King and others gained, the giant gained, and the Dragonblood Marquis gained. All three parties benefited! As for who lost, naturally, it was only those foolish enough to die.

The giant's fork caused the path to tremble, and he spoke more, "Death is the final destination. To think you can resurrect them is mere wishful thinking! The Path of Time cannot accommodate their existence!"

Su Yu discerned that this giant was not the original!

Su Yu didn't care about his words but curiously asked, "Are you an avatar or a lingering imprint? A mental imprint?"

The giant remained calm, thrusting his fork again, causing Su Yu to retreat, "What does it matter if I'm an avatar or an imprint? I am me! The avatar is me, the imprint is me, life is me, death is me, all paths are me!"

He continued, "Do you intend to integrate these people into the world you've opened? You dare to do so with such strength, and you've succeeded. It's truly impressive... But you are currently infringing upon my path! Do you realize this is a life-and-death feud?"

"Though I am not the original, should the original return one day, your act of seizing the path will be a life-and-death feud!"

Indeed, this time, Su Yu was the one actively seizing the path. If someone died, and the Lord of Death Spirits helped them return, a price would be paid. Now, Su Yu intended to take them away, which was unacceptable!

The South King and others were like crops nurtured by the Lord of Death Spirits, to be harvested at will. But now, Su Yu, an outsider, wanted to uproot these crops entirely. If this wasn't a feud, what was?

Su Yu laughed, "So, you're saying you won't kill me?"

Otherwise, why mention the original?

The giant, however, remained indifferent, "Kill you? You can leave at any time. This conflict is merely about whether you can take these people away. Do you think we can decide life and death between us now? I am not the original. Once I leave the Death Path, my strength weakens, and entering the Realm of the Living, I am powerless. How could I kill you?"

Exactly!

That was the crux of this struggle. As for Su Yu's demise, the probability was low. So, those with clear eyes could see it. Those who couldn't were already dead.

Su Yu smiled, "Then why not step back?"

"I have never retreated!"

With that, the giant's massive fork suddenly transformed into countless ropes, sweeping toward Su Yu, intending to bind him!

"I knew you weren't honest!"

At this moment, Su Yu was not idle either. While they chatted, both were preparing. The opponent's fork transformed into ropes, a unique skill. Meanwhile, Su Yu was secretly gathering strength, pointing out a pen stroke that formed a great lock, a cage, a suppression symbol, and a binding array!

Boom!

A loud noise erupted again, and at this time, behind him, a surge of auras rose, much stronger than before. The South King and others had arrived!

The South King struck from a distance, snorting coldly, "You revived me, and I've served you for many years. The source of death spirits has also supplied the Death Path for years. We are already even, so we are merely in a mutually beneficial relationship. You are not the master!"

These words were naturally directed at the giant.

The giant quickly retreated a step, indifferent, or rather, dismissive, ignoring them! Ants! The two sides were not on the same level. Even if the South King was powerful now, so what? The Death Spirit Emperor was stronger than Su Yu, so what? In the giant's eyes, the Death Spirit Emperor was merely a dog, a dog he raised. It might bite back, it might not, it might wag its tail and beg, or it might bite back. So what? A dog he raised was still a dog!

Only Su Yu, whose power level was not unique, was worth considering!

Thus, the giant couldn't be bothered to argue with the South King. If you say so, then so be it. If you say anything, so be it. If I take it seriously, I lose.

His indifference made the South King frown, quickly turning into a cold snort, saying no more.

At this moment, others also gathered. Previously, there were over sixty strong individuals, now only about thirty remained. Some were killed by those who followed orders earlier, some by the South King and others.

Su Yu sensed slightly, frowning immediately.

Xingyue and Hetu were not present.

The South King knew Su Yu's thoughts and quickly transmitted, "Your Majesty, Xingyue... Xingyue cannot find her source!"

Su Yu was slightly stunned.

Cannot find the source?

What does that mean?

He instantly looked at the giant, suddenly speaking directly, "Lord of Death Spirits... never mind, let's call you Death Spirit Daoist. Though we have our conflicts, how about I ask you something?"

The giant retreated a few steps, not intimidated by Su Yu's words, but avoiding their edge, waiting for his strength to recover. Su Yu was stalling for time, and he was happy to oblige. Stall away!

"Speak!"

The giant was indifferent but still responded.

Su Yu asked, "A friend of mine, of high status, died many years ago, but now her source cannot be found! You, as the master of the Death Path, should know the situation, right?"

"Cannot find the source?"

The giant seemed to fall into thought, and after a long time, a strange light appeared in his eyes as he suddenly looked at Su Yu.

Soon, he laughed, for the first time.

"You want to resurrect her?"

"Of course!"

The giant laughed again, "Then you might be disappointed. I might know who you're talking about! It's not that her source cannot be found, but her backer is not weak. When she died, her backer forcibly extended her life!"

He continued, smiling faintly, "I'm quite curious about your choice! I don't mind telling you a bit about her situation. I know a thing or two. Her source is not entirely in the Death Path... no, or rather, not entirely in the Death Path! You should know the point of life and death intersection!"

"Her source is half in the Path of Time, half with me!"

"If you want to resurrect her, you not only offend my original but also that one!"

"Her state is special, half alive, half dead, not in the usual sense of half-life and half-death... truly balanced between life and death! Such a feat, only an unparalleled expert can achieve. Back then, I vaguely remember, a later expert, self-proclaimed Human Emperor, came to ask for a favor, maintaining her in this state... waiting for later resurrection!"

"I thought she had long left, but it seems she's still here!"

The giant chuckled, "I know a bit about what the Human Emperor intended. Perhaps he also wanted to open the heavens, to create his own world, and then draw this woman in. Unfortunately... he probably failed later, as there's no more news of him."

Su Yu's heart trembled.

Human Emperor!

Indeed, Xingyue was related to the Human Emperor, and when Xingyue died, the Human Emperor had come to the Death Path, intending to resurrect Xingyue. However, at that time, the Human Emperor had not yet opened the heavens. Midway, he had to abandon the opening of the heavens, and naturally, there was no more news of the Human Emperor.

Su Yu asked solemnly, "Her source is at the intersection of life and death? So, to resurrect her... I need to go to the River of Time to connect with the other half of her source?"

"Wrong!"

The giant replied indifferently, "To resurrect her is different from others! When others die, they are truly dead. I draw their source from the River of Time and recreate them!"

"But this woman is neither alive nor dead, not truly dead. Since she's not truly dead, how can we speak of resurrection?"

Su Yu was once again stunned. This time, he truly didn't understand what this guy meant.

After a long time, Su Yu frowned, "What do you mean?"

The giant didn't mind telling him these things, partly to stall for time, and secondly, Su Yu was qualified to discuss the Dao with him. Even the weakest of those who opened the heavens were still those who opened the heavens!

"To restore her is actually quite simple..."

Simple?

Su Yu felt a bit strange. Could it really be that simple?

The giant chuckled, "Indeed, it's quite simple. Your path of opening the heavens, I see you've comprehended life and death, reversing life and death, it's not difficult! She is also half-life, half-death, and you are actually the same. You go to the intersection, find her source, and give her the path of life and death from your world. She will transform the path of life and death, and naturally, she will be resurrected!"

Su Yu was stunned. That simple?

The giant chuckled, "Isn't it simple? However, as one who opens the heavens, let me remind you, the path of life and death in your world is very strong and unique. If you give these two paths to someone else, once they turn against you... you will find it difficult to reclaim them. From then on, the life and death of all beings in your world will be at her whim!"

"Right now, she's being suppressed by both the Time and Death Paths, and her memory might not even be one percent intact. The person you know might not be the same after her revival!" The giant's smile grew even wider. "Others might regain their memories and true selves, but not her! She's being suppressed by two supreme paths simultaneously. The person you know is just a fraction of her, an insignificant part! So, what if it's simple? Are you sure you want to revive her?"

Su Yu chuckled. "So, you're saying that once she recovers, she won't be the Xingyue we know now? Unlike the South King and the others, who might remain the same after recovery?"

"Exactly!" The giant smiled faintly. "So, you're willing to hand over two crucial paths of your world to someone else, someone unfamiliar? Yes, once she revives, you won't recognize her! Then, will you still think it's simple? Will you still think it's worth it? Behind her, there's also a supreme being. If the Human Emperor isn't dead, even if he failed to open the heavens, he's still a supreme being. Be careful he doesn't use her to invade your world!"

Su Yu laughed, suddenly turning and shouting, "Let's go to the Intersection of Life and Death!"

The giant followed step by step, smiling faintly. "Are you really not going to reconsider? Impulsiveness will be punished! Young people love to act on impulse, but you'll realize later how dangerous it is! Opening the heavens isn't easy. Why risk everything for a stranger? While my strength hasn't fully recovered to the level of a master of laws, you still have a chance to revive others... Are you really going to gamble everyone's future on this woman?"

This was clearly an attempt to sow discord!

The South King immediately recognized it and said coldly, "His Majesty won't abandon anyone!"

Su Yu laughed heartily. "South King, you're wrong. If someone needs to be abandoned, they will be! Don't put me on a pedestal; it's unnecessary. Xingyue is different. Many things I've obtained actually belong to her! I repay kindness and avenge grievances! As for everyone else... I'm confident I can help you all revive. Don't pay attention to this mental imprint; such provocations are child's play. Even if the Lord of the Dead were here, he wouldn't play such games!"

"Confident?" The giant smiled. "There's still hope now, but wait a bit longer, and your confidence... might become a joke!"

Su Yu ignored him.

The giant continued, "Are you sure you want to hand over the Path of Life and Death to her?"

"Why not?" Su Yu smiled. "The Path of Life and Death isn't my core path! Friend, you're being short-sighted! My Path of Life and Death is good, but it's only because these two paths are useful. It's not like they're my core paths! Even if she regains her true self and is no longer the Xingyue of this moment, so what? I'll do what I need to do!"

The giant smiled, not in a hurry, following Su Yu step by step.

His aura was growing stronger by the moment.

Every second, he was reviving to greater strength!

Gradually, he was reaching a level equal to Su Yu, and he continued to grow stronger.

...

At the same time.

Deep within the path, Xingyue held the Starry Sky Seal, suppressing the fluctuations of the path, searching everywhere. After a long time, she muttered, "Forget it, let's go back!"

She vaguely felt that her origin was even deeper.

Now, much time had been wasted.

Forget it, stop searching!

Beside her, Hetu and Xia Chen were protecting her path. At this moment, both were extremely uneasy. The stronger one is, the deeper the origin.

The South King's origin had been found, but Xingyue kept moving forward. Without the Starry Sky Seal, they would have been crushed by the waves long ago!

Is she really sensing something, or is she just wandering aimlessly?

Where exactly is Xingyue's origin?

Xingyue said nothing, turned around, and started heading back. She hadn't gone far when waves of aura fluctuations came.

Hetu was startled. "Has His Majesty been defeated and is retreating?"

Otherwise, why would he come so deep!

Just as he was thinking, figures appeared, and Su Yu's laughter echoed, "Why are you heading back?"

"Xingyue said she couldn't find her origin, so she stopped looking..."

Hetu had just finished speaking when Su Yu laughed, "How could she not find it? How could one not know where their own origin is? Lady Xingyue, isn't your origin at the end?"

Xingyue's face was cold. "I can't find it!"

"Alright, I know. It's at the end. Let's go, I'll accompany you!"

Su Yu chuckled. "What are you worried about? Worried about wasting too much time? It's fine, look, the friend behind us isn't in a hurry, so we shouldn't be either!"

Everyone looked and indeed, the giant behind them wasn't in a hurry, leisurely following at a distance, smiling. "Continue, I also want to see what happens after this half-life, half-death revival!"

Hetu was stunned and transmitted, "Your Majesty... have you subdued him?"

What are you thinking!

Su Yu was speechless. Subdue him? The guy was clearly here to watch the show, and you can't see that?

The giant's strength was already advancing towards the level of a master of laws!

...

The group continued forward.

Xingyue frowned several times, wanting to speak, but Su Yu interrupted her each time. What's there to say? Just keep quiet. There's no time to waste with endless chatter with a woman!

Soon, they reached the Land of Life and Death.

At this moment, everyone saw the intertwining of two forces, and Xingyue's eyes first showed confusion, then a hint of clarity.

Her origin was indeed nearby!

Su Yu looked at Xingyue and smiled. "Lady Xingyue, it seems you've sensed it too. Your origin should be here! Having a strong backing is great. Could you be the Human Emperor's daughter? Sister? Wife? Or... the Human Emperor's mother?"

Under Xingyue's furious gaze, Su Yu laughed. "The friend behind us said that reviving you is actually quite simple. The Culture King wanted to help you revive back then, but the Paths of Life and Death weren't strong enough! And your revival... I suspect, is different from everyone else's!"

Su Yu laughed. "You might be accepted by the River of Time, while the South King and the others might not be!"

Behind them, the giant chuckled. "It's not a possibility. This woman will definitely be accepted by the River of Time upon revival. That's why I said you're in danger! Because she will continue to control everything she cultivated in the River of Time back then, while also independently mastering your Path of Life and Death. She won't be under your control!"

Xingyue's state was even more unique than Hetu's. She was truly dead, but her backer, the Human Emperor, had once come here and directly merged her origin, half-life, half-death, into two paths!

One Path of Life, one Path of Death!

So, what the Death Path brought was actually incomplete, just a small part of the origin.

Su Yu couldn't help but marvel. Having a background is really something.

Look, even after death, she wasn't fully taken, could still survive, could revive, and could directly return to the River of Time, while others didn't have this treatment!

At this moment, Xingyue frowned. "What do you mean?"

The giant chuckled. "This little friend probably wants to hide something. I don't mind saying a few more words..."

He hadn't finished when Su Yu directly said, "What's there to hide? It's childish! Once you're alive, you'll control the Paths of Life and Death in my world. Your memory is only one percent. Once revived, the memory of the dead, the memory of me, is probably like... taking a leak and meeting a fellow leaker. Got it?"

"......"

Everyone was stunned. What kind of analogy is that?

Su Yu laughed heartily. "Why are you looking at me? That's the reality. Taking a leak, meeting someone else doing the same, you see them, but who knows who they are? Next time you meet, will you recognize them?"

"That's not necessarily true!"

Hetu pondered and nodded, and everyone looked at Hetu strangely. Your words are quite meaningful!

At this moment, everyone almost burst into laughter because of these two.

Xingyue, however, frowned and looked coldly at Su Yu. "So, I'll forget you?"

"Probably not, but you might treat me as a stranger!"

Su Yu smiled. "Alright, we weren't really acquaintances anyway. You came to convert me back then, I later used you, and borrowed the Starry Sky Seal and the Great Dao Map from you... Now, I'm repaying with the Paths of Life and Death!"

Xingyue looked at him coldly. "You want to settle accounts?"

Su Yu laughed. "That's a strange way to put it... but yes, it's quite clear! However, after Lady Xingyue revives, if you still remember me, take care of me. The Human Emperor is a great backer!"

"Hmph!"

Xingyue snorted coldly. "I won't revive. I don't need you to repay anything!"

Su Yu laughed. "It's not up to you!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned for a moment, then saw Su Yu step forward, grab Xingyue by the neck, and laugh. "You're a weakling. Do you think you have a say? If I want to repay, I'll repay. Stop talking nonsense! Hurry up, if you keep dawdling, the friend from the Death Path will become a true master of laws!"

Su Yu directly pressed Xingyue into the Intersection of Life and Death, laughing. "Quickly merge with your origin!"

"I won't!"

Xingyue resisted, furious. "I won't revive!"

Su Yu laughed heartily. "Come on, hurry up. Why not revive? Want to keep the beautiful memories with me? You're a dead spirit tens of thousands of years old, and you still want to eat my tender grass?"

"......"

Everyone was stunned. Damn it, what if we want to laugh?

Xingyue was furious, aggrieved, and somewhat ashamed!

Yes, am I not reviving because I'm thinking of something?

No!

She shouted angrily, "Who wants to keep anything? What beautiful memories do I have with you? Su Yu, you're overestimating yourself!"

Su Yu laughed loudly. "True, we don't have much of a memory! I just absorbed, absorbed, absorbed, drained you a few times, hahaha..."

"......"

Such wild words!

At this moment, even the South King couldn't listen anymore and shouted, "Hurry up, do you have to wait until he becomes a master of laws?"

What are you doing!

Marquis Lanshan also looked at Su Yu with a strange expression. His Majesty... can be quite cheeky at times!

Su Yu chuckled, then quickly turned serious. "Alright, let's get back to business! I don't like owing people. When you owe too much, it's not a favor anymore; it becomes a burden. Whoever does me a favor, I'll repay it... It's not about keeping score, but I don't want favors to turn sour and become a burden!"

"Xingyue!" Su Yu looked at Xingyue, his voice firm. "Once you recover, whether you remember me or not, it doesn't matter! I have only one request..."

Xingyue remained silent for a moment before speaking in a low voice, "Speak!"

Su Yu's expression grew solemn. The atmosphere shifted, and everyone else became serious, their faces grave. What was Su Yu about to say?

After a brief silence, Su Yu suddenly declared, "The paths of life and death... I can't give them to you."

Everyone was stunned. Xingyue was also taken aback! What was this? This scoundrel insisted on giving it to me when I didn't want it. Now that I'm not refusing, he's not giving it. Is he doing this on purpose?

Su Yu burst into laughter. "Of course, I can't give it to you. The necromancer friend is trying to trick me. If I give it to you now, how am I supposed to resurrect others? Hahaha!"

Su Yu laughed heartily. "So, you should first merge with the origin. I'll revive everyone else first, then merge the paths of life and death for you. Even if you turn against us, we won't lose out. That necromancer friend is indeed cunning, setting traps on purpose!"

Behind him, the giant laughed. "Little friend, you do like to overthink. I could have always told you not to do this!"

Su Yu turned to look at him, smiling. "Friend, you're almost at the level of a ruler of laws, aren't you?"

"I suppose... I've reached it!"

Boom!

A powerful aura surged from the giant as he stepped forward, his smile fading. "I didn't want to kill you, but you insist on courting death by coming to the depths of the Death Path. Now, you can't tear through the path. How will you escape?"

Su Yu pointed behind him, smiling. "I'll escape into the Time Path!"

The giant replied calmly, "Indeed, but only if you can survive against me! Su Yu, isn't it? Little friend, you have many tricks, but unfortunately... this is my territory!"

"No!" Su Yu shook his head. "This belongs to the master of the Death Path. He is the overlord, not you. You're just his projection, a mere avatar, a mental imprint. You're not him! People like us never acknowledge avatars or imprints as ourselves. We are who we are! Do you understand?"

Su Yu laughed. "An avatar is an avatar, an imprint is an imprint. Who says an avatar or imprint is me?"

Su Yu chuckled. "I've never thought that way. Whether it's an avatar or an imprint, they're just tools, means to an end. Who would consider a tool as themselves? Isn't that foolish?"

The giant's face turned cold. "Even now, you're provoking me!"

"Of course, why should I fear you?" Su Yu laughed. "You've become a ruler of laws, and this place is indeed your territory, but... I'm not afraid of you!"

"Courting death!" A cold shout erupted, and a terrifying aura surged, attacking Su Yu.

The South King and others were about to intervene when Su Yu laughed. "No need, everyone prepare for revival! Liu Hong!"

A loud shout echoed!

In the next moment, Liu Hong, who had been missing, suddenly roared!

At this moment, within the Death Realm, on the Death Path, a path suddenly moved deeper, Liu Hong's aura erupting as he ran, moving the Ink Path tributary, unable to help but curse, "Why go deeper?"

"Nonsense, the power of life and death is over here. Hurry up!" Su Yu's voice echoed.

Liu Hong roared, moving the Ink Path, shouting, "Everyone, clear all obstacles, quickly!"

In an instant, many powerful figures appeared.

Wan Tiansheng and others arrived. Without needing to be told, Wan Tiansheng glanced around and quickly shouted, "Kill all obstructing necromancers! Quickly! Suppress the power of the Death Path! Everyone, act!"

"Disperse and attack, target the path!"

"......"

Boom!

Countless experts acted!

Heaven and earth shook!

Meanwhile, Liu Hong moved the Ink Path, frantically moving it, shouting, "At least three Heavenly Sovereigns, all Heavenly Sovereigns come, move to that guy's side, he'll try to stop us, let's take him down together!"

"Just a ruler of laws, let's kill him!"

"Fat Ball, Giant Axe, March, gather quickly!"

Everyone shouted, while Giant Axe and March were bewildered. Damn it!

Here, rulers of laws are taken down casually?

This place, it seems two rulers of laws have appeared today!

The Necromancer Emperor and this giant's avatar.

Today, it seems Heavenly Sovereigns aren't worth much here?

While thinking, a powerful aura suddenly came from afar, and the Martial Emperor's roar echoed, "Get lost! You bastards, where are you attacking?"

March and the others quickly looked over, all stunned!

Is this the Martial Emperor?

At this moment, the Martial Emperor wasn't trying to make his presence known. The group led by September was chasing some necromancers, fighting near the Martial Emperor's passage. Fighting was fine, but they kept attacking the Martial Emperor's passage entrance.

The Martial Emperor was furious!

I've been so low-key, with battles happening all day, and I haven't intervened, haven't participated, haven't gotten involved. What do you take me for?

In his anger, he roared, punching out, shattering a newly resurrected necromancer king from the Celestial River of Death into pieces, exploding it!

Frightened, September and the others quickly retreated.

Seeing them retreat, the Martial Emperor snorted coldly. "Don't think that just because you're under Su Yu, I won't kill you!"

March was shocked!

September is in danger; this is an incredibly powerful being.

The next moment, the Martial Emperor snorted again. "Forget it, scram. As long as that dog doesn't bother me again, I can't be bothered with you!"

With that, he turned and ran back into the passage, closing it with a creak!

March and Giant Axe exchanged glances... Damn it, what an eye-opener!

Is he scared?

Scared, yet he speaks so domineeringly, so fiercely. The Martial Emperor is indeed the Martial Emperor!

Admitting fear but not admitting it verbally!

At this moment, Liu Hong roared, "Hurry up, what are those two Heavenly Sovereigns standing there for? Don't they have any sense?"

I'm so angry!

Are the two Heavenly Sovereigns from the Upper Realm idiots?

Fighting until now, they feel a bit dazed!

March and Giant Axe exchanged glances, yes, he's talking about us!

The two of us are overlords in the Upper Realm!

Here... we're constantly being despised!

It's really embarrassing!

They stopped speaking, silently following Liu Hong, clearing the way for him. Liu Hong moved the Ink Path rapidly, reaching the end in the blink of an eye.

Boom!

At this moment, a powerful aura erupted, and the giant stabbed at the Ink Path with a fork, surprised and shaken. "You actually opened a secret path, and I didn't know. Damn it!"

"Like hell you'd know!"

Liu Hong cursed, then quickly shouted, "Heavenly Sovereigns, attack him! Do you think he's attacking me?"

Almost exploding with anger!

Such poor coordination!

It's really annoying!

Cooperating with smart people is truly enjoyable. You just need to prepare your stance, and they know what to do!

These guys, even if you lie down, they still need you to instruct them on how to act!

Three Heavenly Sovereigns, along with several Heavenly Kings, attacked!

Powerful forces surged into the Ink Path, reaching the top in an instant, forcing the giant to take a step back.

At this moment, Su Yu laughed heartily, a surge of life and death power spreading from the Ink Path, directly towards the Land of Chaos. "Necromancer friend, it seems I've still won!"

"Everyone, enter the Ink Path, cross into the Land of Chaos, enter my world, and be reborn!"

Boom!

At this moment, the world shook, and numerous necromancer experts rushed into the Ink Path. Liu Hong roared violently, the Ink Path swaying, shouting, "Quick, Your Majesty, drive that guy away, or we can't guide them away!"

Su Yu cursed, "Nonsense, I'm maintaining the path of life and death, where do I have time to deal with you! March, Giant Axe, Fat Ball... follow the Ink Path up and fight him together!"

One by one, powerful beings entered the Death Path through the Ink Path.

At this moment, the Death Path shook violently, a powerful repulsive force weakening the aura of several living experts. The giant sneered, "Living beings entering, courting death?"

"Just hold on!"

Su Yu roared, just hold on for a while!

At this moment, he was guiding the power of life and death, guiding his own world, intending to transfer the South King and others over, not only transferring but also using the rich power of life and death here to revive them!

"World invasion!"

A furious shout, boom!

In the distance, Su Yu's small world, taking advantage of the Death Path's turmoil and the giant being held back, charged directly towards the Land of Chaos!

In the void, a book and a great seal were rapidly breaking the Death Path's dominion!

Since we're fighting, I'm going to seize your territory too!

"Courting death!"

Boom!

The giant stabbed March with a fork, then stabbed Giant Axe with another fork, quickly engaging in battle with Fat Ball.

Meanwhile, Su Yu rapidly gathered countless life forces, looking at the South King and Lanshan, smiling, "Who wants to go first?"

"......"

Below, Hetu collapsed, "Your Majesty, let me go first!"

"......"

Su Yu laughed, "No rush, you first merge with the origin, everyone has seen it, that's enough. As for revival, you don't need to go first!"

Damn you!

Be a person!

You keep saying women are obstacles, but at critical moments, you only know how to revive women first?

Damn it!

Hetu was extremely frustrated!

At this moment, a powerful life force merged into Marquis Lanshan's body, Su Yu smiled, "Alright, Lanshan will set an example first! Liu Hong, cut off the Death Path, connect to my world!"

"Alright!"

Boom!

The middle of the Ink Path quickly closed, and at this moment, Marquis Lanshan instantly transformed from a black person to a white person, from a white person to a black-and-white yin-yang person, constantly changing, her appearance constantly shifting!

The next moment, she flew out of the Ink Path, outside, into Su Yu's world.

She had been there before!

At this moment, everything felt extraordinarily different!

Suddenly, she sensed the existence of her physical body and felt the rejection of the power of death!

Lanshan was stunned!

Am I... resurrected?

She suddenly raised her hand, staring at it blankly. Meanwhile, Su Yu roared, "Quickly connect to the Great Dao within my world, the one that suits you best. Hurry, be careful!"

Boom!

At that instant, both the Death Path and Su Yu's Great Dao erupted with a thunderous force, striking towards Marquis Lanshan!

This world does not permit your resurrection!

To rise from the dead, now that truly throws everything into chaos!

Just a moment ago, Marquis Lanshan was pale, but in the blink of an eye, she was struck by lightning and turned dark!

Marquis Lanshan let out a piercing scream, filled with agony, yet... it felt so exhilarating!

"Hahaha! I can feel pain!"

Marquis Lanshan went mad, I can feel pain!

Oh heavens, I can actually feel pain!

And Su Yu couldn't help but roar again, "Shut up, transform your clothes! Do you want to be resurrected only to be ogled by those old lechers?"

"......"

In that instant, even the Great Dao seemed to quiet down.

A group of elder powerhouses, each felt a pang in their liver!

Who the hell are you calling old lechers?

Who are you implying?

Marquis Lanshan was also taken aback, but the next moment, she burst into laughter, her laughter crisp yet coarse!

"Fine, I'll only show His Majesty! Hahaha, Your Majesty, I'm very beautiful!"

Boom!

In an instant, she was struck by lightning and turned into charcoal. Su Yu was speechless, is this what you call beautiful?

Heh!

These women, all have a mysterious confidence!

At this moment, the entire world shook violently, not just Su Yu's world. At this moment, the Death Path, the Time Path, Su Yu's Great Dao, and even the Human Emperor's Great Dao were all trembling!

Someone has been resurrected!

Risen from the dead!
