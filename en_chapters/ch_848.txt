Chapter 848: Seeking Heaven and Earth

This battle erupted quickly and ended just as swiftly. However, the gains were substantial.

Especially for Su Yu. The Martial Emperor had integrated his dao with the heavens and earth, and the Nether Emperor, at the first-tier level, had done the same, though he hadn't severed all his paths. Even so, a first-tier expert was formidable. Additionally, the Great Zhou King had integrated his second-tier dao with the heavens and earth.

At this point, within his own domain, Su Yu had reached the first-tier level. Outside his domain, he was close to the peak of the second tier. If he borrowed power from the return, he could barely reach the first-tier level outside as well. Indeed, combat is the fastest way to progress. The energy and power of laws from the slain rulers of laws had yet to be fully absorbed by Su Yu.

Once fully absorbed, he might advance further on the first-tier path. Moreover, the Human Emperor had casually integrated his collapsing physical body into Su Yu's domain. Su Yu hadn't paid much attention, but in truth, the Human Emperor was still the Human Emperor. Even a body on the verge of burning out made Su Yu feel that the physical dao within his domain had grown stronger.

At this moment, within his domain, two great daos had vaguely reached the second-tier level: the physical dao and the Nether Death Dao from before.

...

Su Yu enjoyed using battle to nurture battle. Every fight was an opportunity for him. Because at this moment, he was at a peak period of progress.

Once he reached the level of the Human Emperor, further combat and advancement would become exceedingly difficult.

At this moment, Su Yu exchanged a few words with the Human Emperor. He was mainly concerned that the Human Emperor might relax, thinking someone else could bear the responsibility, and thus lose his drive. That would be disastrous.

The Human Emperor was severely injured!

However, Su Yu was also somewhat puzzled. He transmitted, "Your Majesty, I see that your sea of will can rival three first-tier experts. Were you really heavily injured by those guys back then?"

Such a powerful Human Emperor—would even the Three Emperors dare to confront him head-on?

Could it be that seven or eight top-tier experts besieged the Human Emperor alone back then?

Hearing Su Yu mention this, the Human Emperor sighed slightly and explained, "Various factors coincided, and I was just unlucky. I was preparing to deal with the Immortal Emperor, to eliminate him and prevent him from causing us trouble."

"As a result, the period of weakness after merging with my future self arrived earlier than expected. That was anticipated, but more unfortunate was that there seemed to be chaos within the Heaven Gate at that time, a riot. I had to take responsibility for suppressing the Heaven Gate... Everything coincided, and the Divine Emperor and others severely injured my physical body. The shattering of the Heaven Gate's shadow led to my sea of will being severely damaged..."

Su Yu was taken aback.

Such bad luck?

The key was, he hurriedly asked, "Does the Heaven Gate's riot affect us too?"

"Yes!"

The Human Emperor thought for a moment and added, "Not really, it's just that I like to meddle. I didn't want the Heaven Gate to open at that time, so I suppressed it for a while. If I hadn't intervened, it wouldn't have been a big issue."

Alright!

Su Yu understood. The Human Emperor's severe injuries were indeed due to bad luck and his tendency to meddle too much.

On one hand, he had to deal with the myriad races, and on the other, he had to suppress the Heaven Gate. Then, just as his period of weakness arrived... It's a wonder he wasn't killed.

"The Heaven Gate riot... Could it be because the Culture King and others were inside, and conflicts with the other side led to it?"

"Possibly!"

The Human Emperor couldn't be certain and shook his head, "If it were back then, I could still investigate the situation through the Heaven Gate. But now, I can't! When Old Second Wen just left, if I had time, I could still look after them... Now, I can't manage it."

Look after them!

From this, it seemed that back then, he might have had some contact with those inside the Heaven Gate. Su Yu's heart stirred, and he suddenly asked, "Your Majesty, were you really set up by the Martial King, or did you send him into the Heaven Gate because the Culture King and others encountered a crisis?"

"…"

The Human Emperor looked at him and coughed lightly, "No such thing, I was set up by Old Second Wen and the others..."

Heh!

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly had a judgment. The Martial King knew the Culture King had left, knew how to enter the Heaven Gate, and really found the Culture King and others. Was it really the Martial King's own doing?

Not necessarily, right?

Perhaps the Human Emperor sensed something, detected a crisis for the Culture King and others, and specifically sent the Martial King there?

And the Martial King... might not even know about it.

From some legends, it could be seen that both the Culture King and the Human Emperor were the type to plan without missing a beat. The Martial King's change might not have been a sudden one, but rather caused by the Human Emperor himself.

Of course, the Martial King's departure, with much fanfare, might have had its own purpose. He had previously mentioned driving the myriad races' experts into the River of Time, somewhat borrowing their power to suppress the Three Gates from opening.

If the Martial King hadn't left, how would the myriad races dare to rebel at that time?

Without rebellion, how would the Human Emperor have a reason to capture them all and drag them into the River of Time? Only at that time was the opportunity most suitable.

Actually, by this point, Su Yu could vaguely sense some things.

He also saw some things!

The changes in ancient times might have been part of the Human Emperor's plan from start to finish. The goal was still clear: to suppress the Three Gates, to prevent them from suddenly opening, and also to support and aid the Culture King.

Everything was actively done by the Human Emperor.

Also, if he didn't take the initiative, he wouldn't have been able to take all the ancient experts with him.

Su Yu shook his head and transmitted, "The Martial King is specifically taking the blame for you guys, and you still feel good about it!"

The Human Emperor coughed lightly and also transmitted, "Not really, I just informed him. He has the right to know, right? You... your brain is indeed sharp. At that time, Old Second Wen did encounter a significant crisis. If Taishan hadn't gone, Old Second Wen might not have held on. I really couldn't leave, so I had no choice but to let Taishan go over and support."

"Is the Martial King very strong?"

"When he left, he was about 20 paths."

The Human Emperor explained, "At the first-tier level, advancing one path is extremely difficult! His strength wasn't weak. After entering, he could also lend a hand to Old Second Wen."

"Don't you think about your own side?"

Su Yu was speechless. The Human Emperor laughed and transmitted, "Do you really think I'm weak? Let's just say, it was bad timing! The period of weakness arriving early and the Heaven Gate's fluctuation should be related, just too unlucky, and there's nothing that can be done!"

Otherwise, he wouldn't have been severely injured back then. If he hadn't been severely injured, he would still have had the opportunity and confidence to continue suppressing the myriad races. Even when severely injured, the myriad races didn't dare to act rashly.

"Bad timing..."

Su Yu thought for a moment and asked, "Could it be that someone calculated against you?"

"That's possible!"

The Human Emperor wasn't surprised and transmitted, "Wenyu had an accident, Old Second Wen went to save him, my period of weakness arrived early, the Heaven Gate rioted... Actually, when you connect it all, it's quite simple. The Three Gates wanted to open, it's that simple! They were worried I'd suppress the Three Gates and not let them open!"

He suddenly felt a bit proud and laughed, "With me here, the Three Gates won't open. I'll decide when to open them! Inside the Three Gates, there should be experts who sensed this, so they calculated against Wenyu and the others. The ultimate goal was to make me open the Three Gates... But I just wouldn't let them have their way and insisted on suppressing them for ten thousand years!"

Otherwise, the Three Gates might have been opened ten thousand years ago.

Su Yu connected the cause and effect, and finally laughed, "Your Majesty still has many means, just meddles in too many things!"

"…"

The Human Emperor was not convinced, "It's not meddling. As an emperor, the emperor of the heavens, whether it's the Three Gates or the Five Gates, let me ask you, if outsiders want to come to your territory, do they need your permission?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded.

"If these guys want to sneak into your territory, should you kill them?"

Su Yu nodded again.

"These guys, when you said they couldn't enter, and even if they wanted to, they had to wait until you could kill them all before letting them in, chose to sneak in. Should you manage it?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded again, yes, it should be managed.

"Isn't that settled?"

The Human Emperor was speechless. You nodded yourself, and you say this is meddling?

I do like to meddle, but this is necessary. This is a challenge to my supreme emperor's dignity. I must kill them!

By this point, Su Yu agreed with his words.

Indeed, my territory, my rules!

Whether the Three Gates open or not, it's up to me!

Back then, the Human Emperor had the same mindset as Su Yu. I'll open it when I want to, but you can't open it secretly. I haven't prepared to kill you all yet, and you're opening it secretly. Isn't that opposing me?

Su Yu somewhat understood this person's mindset. Deep down, he was still domineering.

It's just that sometimes, he did things without saying, giving people the impression of an honest person.

It seemed like the people inside the Three Gates were calculating against him, but in reality, it wasn't. It was him insisting on blocking the Three Gates, not letting the strong inside come out. The other side was somewhat forced, having no choice but to deal with him.

"Alright then! The strong inside the Three Gates do need to be dealt with!"

Su Yu nodded, "I'll let you out, and then you can come out. If you insist on coming out forcefully... then you should be dealt with. But it seems like the Human Emperor was the one dealt with!"

The Human Emperor felt a bit aggrieved!

That's the way it is, but hearing it still feels unpleasant!

What kind of talk is this?

Su Yu thought for a moment and asked, "Do the myriad races know about the situation with the Three Gates?"

The Human Emperor laughed, "Most likely, a few of them do. Of course, it's limited to a few people. They've been opposing us for many years, and it's not impossible that they've been influenced by the strong inside the Three Gates, like those who established realms during the era of opening the heavens!"

So, some of the myriad races also knew why they were opposing the human race and were aware of the Human Emperor's goal.

"They know, and they still dare to meddle?"

"They're not weak, why wouldn't they dare to meddle?"

The Human Emperor was speechless. Are you underestimating the myriad races?

They're quite formidable too!

Su Yu laughed.

The Human Emperor also laughed.

As they laughed, the Human Emperor asked, "Have you connected with the existence inside the Heaven Gate?"

"Well, Gui, does the Human Emperor know about him?"

"Gui?"

The Human Emperor thought for a moment, then shook his head. "Never heard of him. Must be a minor figure. I'm not familiar with small fry."

"......"

That was a hard statement to follow. After all, Gui was a first-class existence, yet in the eyes of the Human Emperor, he was reduced to a mere nobody. Such arrogance.

However, Su Yu pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement. Perhaps Gui had only recently broken through to the first class. Previously, he might have been second class. To someone like the Human Emperor, who was at his peak and on the verge of fully opening the heavens, an ancient second-class existence was indeed not worth noting or even considering.

The Human Emperor didn't pay much attention to Gui, only cautioning, "Don't be careless. If the opponent maintains their power for too long, they might manage to descend upon the Myriad Realms from the Void Gate... Of course, if they're not strong, there's no need to worry too much!"

He added, "If you really want to fish, don't fish for small fry. Go for the big ones! The weak ones aren't worth it. If you kill the one connected to your Heaven Gate, it will be difficult to connect to the next one... If I were you, and the opponent wasn't strong, I might look for an opportunity to go in reverse and explore the Heaven Gate first."

Su Yu's eyes flickered. He looked at the Human Emperor and suddenly asked, "Has Your Majesty ever entered the Heaven Gate?"

The Human Emperor shook his head, then nodded. "I've probed it with my will once, but I didn't go deep. I was discovered by a strong figure inside the Heaven Gate and was driven out. Damn it, if it weren't inside the Heaven Gate, I would have killed that bastard!"

He had indeed tried to investigate. For someone like the Human Emperor, knowing oneself and the enemy was the best strategy. He wanted to suppress the Three Gates, so naturally, he needed to understand them, especially the Heaven Gate.

The beings inside the Heaven Gate wanted to plant stakes in the Myriad Realms and understand them. Similarly, the Human Emperor had the same idea. Strictly speaking, the Culture King and Martial King were also stakes the Human Emperor had driven into the Heaven Gate.

Su Yu chuckled and asked, "What about Yiyue of the Iron Devourer Race, the Martial King's mount, and the previous emperor of the Hou Race? Why haven't I seen them? Does the Human Emperor have other plans for them?"

Indeed, he hadn't seen these figures, not even among the Myriad Races.

"Them?" The Human Emperor laughed. "They didn't come with us. Didn't you know?"

Su Yu was taken aback. How would I know? What do you mean they didn't come with you?

"I placed them in the Earth Gate. I don't know if they're dead..."

The Human Emperor sighed and shook his head.

Su Yu was stunned. After a while, he said, "At that time, things were so dangerous, and you placed them in the Earth Gate?"

Such courage. Weren't you afraid of dying?

The Human Emperor explained, "Initially, the situation wasn't so tense! At that time, the Three Gates were in turmoil. My main goal was still to suppress the Three Gates. I couldn't find the Human Gate, and the Heaven Gate had Wen Lao'er and the others. The Earth Gate was on our territory... So, of course, I had to place some people inside! The Human Race wasn't suitable, but the Iron Devourer Race and such beings, being evolutions of the Chaos Ancient Clan, could actually disguise themselves as Chaos Ancient Clan members if they didn't use the Myriad Realms' Dao too much!"

He explained a few things, and Su Yu was impressed. So, Yiyue and the others hadn't left with them but had entered the Earth Gate instead.

Are they dead?

Yiyue wasn't dead; Su Yu knew that much.

So, the Human Emperor had arrangements in both gates, which coincided with Su Yu's thoughts. Previously, he had also wanted to place people in the Earth Gate, but he needed manpower at the time, so he had to give up.

Now it seemed the Human Emperor was still quite formidable. He just overestimated himself and couldn't defeat the Myriad Races.

Yiyue and the others had gone to the Gate of Hell, which explained why they weren't found this time. Su Yu had thought they were lurking among the Myriad Races.

Seeing Su Yu deep in thought, the Human Emperor asked, "Is there anything else you want to know? Some of my backup plans I might have forgotten. If you don't ask, I might not remember. What else do you want to know?"

As a newcomer, Su Yu knew a lot, but compared to the Human Emperor, he was far behind.

Naturally, Su Yu had questions. He immediately asked, "Can't the Human Emperor's Dao form its own system?"

"It's not a Dao; it's a world!"

Su Yu clarified, worried the Human Emperor might not understand.

The Human Emperor was dismissive. He understood perfectly and quickly explained, "It's not very complete, but to say it can't form a system isn't accurate! It's just that my initial idea was different from yours. I wanted to quickly perfect my Dao by borrowing the River of Time. Plus, I lacked foundational treasures at the time, so I directly opened it on the River of Time. This way, the Dao could quickly become powerful, but there are drawbacks. Many drawbacks... First, it can't be easily moved. Second, it can be interfered with by the river. Third, it can't temporarily form a closed loop, a closed world!"

Su Yu rolled his eyes. "Isn't that still incomplete?"

A bunch of reasons, but the key point was that the Human Emperor's world was still incomplete. Su Yu's world formed a closed loop, but the Human Emperor's couldn't.

The Human Emperor coughed lightly. Why say it so bluntly?

Besides, at the time, the world was just a support for him. The main focus was still his Dao. He planned to merge with the Dao once the world became powerful, so there wouldn't be a period of power vacuum.

Unfortunately, he didn't get to that point.

The two chatted for a bit. Seeing the two sides still standing apart, the Human Emperor suddenly smiled and said, "Don't just stand there. Su Yu has many acquaintances here. Snow King, your daughter is here. I've seen her. Go recognize your relatives, chat. The Myriad Races won't dare do anything for a while. I'm not dead yet, am I? Why so serious?"

He and Su Yu were having a pleasant conversation, but everyone else was silently watching. The Human Emperor wanted to promote some interaction between the two sides. After all, they needed to unite against the enemy next.

Hearing this, everyone relaxed a bit. In fact, Snow King and others had been eager for a while, but since the leaders hadn't said anything, it wasn't appropriate to exchange pleasantries at this moment.

Quickly, on the Human Emperor's side, Snow King rushed out to her daughter, and Xuelan, with a complex expression, also wanted to talk to her mother. For Snow King and the others, perhaps not much time had passed.

But for the strong of the Myriad Realms, a hundred thousand years had passed!

Too long!

...

Su Yu watched for a while and chuckled.

There were still many ancient powerhouses on his side, like Yingwu, Nanxi, Zhennan, and Wuji...

These people were all ancient powerhouses.

Some of them still followed living powerhouses, but of course, some Human Kings had long since died in battle.

At this moment, the Human Emperor was introducing these powerhouses to Su Yu. "On my side, those at the first-class level are the Radiant King, the Suppressing Martial King, and the Radiant King's partner. You can call her the Radiant Consort. For now, only these three have reached the first-class level. The Battle King is close!"

Just three, Su Yu nodded slightly. Not many.

On the Myriad Races' side, the Immortal Emperor, Demon Emperor, Divine Emperor, Dragon Emperor, Phoenix Emperor, Nether Emperor, and Spirit Emperor all seemed to be first-class, though some seemed to have just broken through. That made seven.

Seeing Su Yu in thought, the Human Emperor added, "Actually, some were close to first-class before, but they later died in battle..."

Su Yu nodded again.

The Human Emperor continued, "As for the matter between the Martial King and the Martial Emperor, let them resolve it themselves. Perhaps the Martial Emperor will die before reaching the Heaven Gate, or maybe both will die before meeting. In that case, there's no need to worry about it! The Suppressing Martial King is straightforward and doesn't respond well to force. There's no need to be too concerned. Her ears are quite soft. If they weren't, Taishan would have been beaten to death long ago for finding so many partners. Taishan may be simple-minded, but he's good at coaxing partners..."

"......"

Su Yu was speechless. Why are you telling me this?

Really!

Su Yu didn't pay much attention to these matters. At this moment, he was still absorbing and digesting some gains. While doing so, he said, "Let's not talk about this. The urgent matter is the Human Emperor's recovery!"

"Me?"

The Human Emperor sighed. "Nonsense. If I could recover, I would have done so long ago. Why wait until now? Besides, my injuries are even worse now. As for merging into the world or the Dao and becoming a Dao spirit..."

The Human Emperor hesitated for a moment and said, "It might be a way to save my life, but it's very difficult. My world and Dao are both very powerful. I might not be able to become a spirit. The risk is too great. If it goes wrong, the Dao will be destroyed, and I'll perish. If that's the case, I might as well leave something behind. Maybe it can benefit future generations."

"For example, the Human Emperor Dao I control, which I named myself, might be passed on to someone. Even if they're not as strong as me, there's hope for them to become first-class! My world could be inherited by someone, and even if it can't be moved, they could still possess first-class power in the Myriad Realms..."

His idea was simple. If he failed, it would be over. But while he was alive, he could lend a hand and perhaps create two first-class powerhouses.

He was in control of his own Dao, what he called the Human Emperor Dao.

And his world, even if it couldn't be moved, could be inherited by someone, granting them first-class power in the Myriad Realms!

But if he tried to become a spirit and failed, the Dao would collapse, and he wouldn't be able to help anyone inherit it.

"I've always believed in myself!"

Su Yu looked at him. "Does Your Majesty not share my tendency to place hope in others?"

The Human Emperor fell silent.

It was a difficult choice.

He knew Su Yu wanted him to live, but at this moment, the Human Emperor still smiled and said, "Think it over. If I die, I'll make arrangements in advance. The Radiant King and others have seen your achievements... They'll likely follow you! You don't need to compete with me. You probably wouldn't want to be subordinate to anyone. But as long as I'm here, you won't be able to control the Radiant King and the others!"

Su Yu sneered, indifferent. "Whatever!"

"......"

You're so arrogant!

The Human Emperor was speechless. I have three first-class powerhouses here, and you don't even have second-class ones. What are you so arrogant about?

"Let's deal with the Myriad Races' trouble first!"

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to respond to that, so he quickly said, "Although the Myriad Races suffered significant losses this time, their top-tier combat strength remains almost intact. Only the Nether Emperor is severely injured, while the others are relatively fine. It's difficult to defeat the Myriad Races..."

The Human Emperor nodded in agreement, "It's indeed difficult, especially given my current state. Even if you possess top-tier combat strength, that's only four against seven. With other forces being roughly equal, it would be a balanced or even disadvantageous war. Winning would still result in mutual destruction. Wars that end in mutual destruction shouldn't be initiated lightly. If it really can't be helped..."

He continued, "Then let's wait. Or perhaps we should actively return to the Myriad Realms, lift the blockade, and prepare for the opening of the Three Gates. For now, coexist peacefully with the Myriad Races."

He added, "Moreover, the Myriad Races were willing to lie low in the past. Now that our combat strength has increased, they might not fight to the death. Perhaps we could attempt to discuss an alliance again."

Su Yu shook his head, "There are too many drawbacks to an alliance. We would have to constantly guard against them turning on us. Even if we do form an alliance, it shouldn't be like this. We should cripple them first, maybe kill half of their strength, and have the remaining half serve us like dogs. Right now, we're just raising tigers, and that's not acceptable."

The Human Emperor looked at Su Yu again. This kid was indeed quite wild.

"But have you thought it through? Right now... it's very difficult to cripple them!"

The Human Emperor understood the situation. The key issue was that even if Su Yu reached top-tier strength, so what? The opposition was too strong!

The Myriad Races were not united. Otherwise, even after losing dozens of rulers of laws, they wouldn't fear us. Knowing that the Human Emperor was incapacitated, if they could reach a consensus and had some ambition, they should seize this opportunity to attack us!

Su Yu fell into deep thought. This time, he had gained a lot, reaching top-tier strength. Outside his own world, Su Yu could wield the power of about 15 paths without borrowing strength. With borrowed strength, 16 paths were achievable. Within his world, Su Yu could exert the power of at least 17 or even 18 paths. But with such strength, he could at most contend with one top-tier expert.

Indeed, the Human Emperor was right. Dealing with the Myriad Races was extremely challenging at this point. The only option might be to choose a fight to the death! Otherwise, trying to weaken the Myriad Races again with similar tactics was almost a dream!

After pondering for a while, Su Yu said, "Your Majesty, you should recover as soon as possible. Even if you can't regain your current strength, being able to handle one or two top-tier opponents would be good. As for me... my main goal is still to expand my world and perfect the Great Dao!"

How to perfect it?

Su Yu contemplated for a moment before continuing, "Your Majesty, you have some understanding of the Heaven Gate. Do you think there's hope for me to enhance myself within the Heaven Gate, then counterattack the Myriad Races, and finally deal with the Three Gates?"

"The Heaven Gate..."

The Human Emperor fell into thought, his eyes flickering for a while before he suddenly said, "There might be a way, but right now, you're probably not strong enough!"

He thought for a moment, then suddenly smiled, "Try to find the world of Wen Lao'er! See if you can open the Heaven Gate's shadow and bring Wen Lao'er over. He should know the most about the Heaven Gate..."

Su Yu's heart stirred, "The world? Wen Wang's world... he didn't take it with him?"

"Of course not!"

The Human Emperor shook his head, "His world can't be easily moved, including yours. If yours could be easily moved, why haven't you moved it here?"

Su Yu laughed, a meaningful smile on his face, "Your Majesty doesn't really think my world can't be easily moved, does he? It's just that I don't want to move it at the moment!"

"Hmm?"

The Human Emperor was surprised. Su Yu smiled, "Actually, if I wanted to move it, I could! I use the Human Lord Seal as the foundation, but I haven't set a final destination yet. If I find a supreme treasure as the endpoint, or simply create a closed loop that returns to the Human Lord Seal, then I can carry the Human Lord Seal with me. In fact, the Human Lord Seal could merge into my Mark of Civilization, which is my treasure for proving the Dao... At that point, I would be the world itself!"

Forcibly moving it wasn't impossible. It would just damage the foundation, which was why Su Yu was reluctant to do so. However, from the Human Emperor's words, it seemed they truly couldn't move their worlds easily.

Su Yu found it a bit odd, "Your worlds have such low completion rates for the Great Dao, why is that?"

"......"

The Human Emperor was speechless for a while before saying, "It's not that the completion rate is low, it's that we've opened fewer paths, so the stability is somewhat lacking. But opening many paths also has its drawbacks; it's much harder to improve!"

Su Yu laughed again, "Could it be that there are some paths you can't open? Like the Life and Death Path, otherwise, wouldn't you have opened it long ago?"

This time, the Human Emperor fell silent for a long time, with a hint of curiosity or perhaps confusion, "The Life and Death Path is indeed difficult to open. How did you manage it, kid?"

"Just really die a few times!"

The Human Emperor was taken aback, and after a while, he said, "I think I understand, but... Wen Lao'er and I can't choose that path. If we really died, it would be a huge problem. I kind of understand you now, putting yourself in a desperate situation to be reborn! You have the determination and perseverance, and so do we, but we can't do it that way!"

Su Yu shrugged, not saying much. He didn't care about this topic. His interest lay elsewhere, so he asked again, "Your Majesty, are you suggesting I find Wen Wang's world to contact him? Don't you know where his world is?"

"I don't know!"

The Human Emperor shook his head, "That bastard is also afraid, afraid I'll merge my world into his, so he didn't tell me where he opened his world."

"......"

Su Yu was stunned, almost bursting into laughter, nearly going mad with laughter!

With that statement, he suddenly understood Wen Wang's mindset. Wen Wang was also worried, worried that if the Human Emperor got into trouble one day, he would run over and merge his world into Wen Wang's. Then, the Great Dao of Responsibility would grow wildly, and Wen Wang, a carefree powerhouse, would suddenly become a pitiable person burdened with immense responsibility!

"Cough, cough, cough..."

Su Yu laughed so hard he wanted to cough.

The Human Emperor was very annoyed and couldn't help but say, "What's so funny? You people, I think you're very irresponsible! The human race gave birth to and raised you. When you become strong, shouldn't you do something for your race, your home, your country?"

What's so funny about that!

Su Yu still wanted to laugh, "No, I'm not laughing at you, Your Majesty. I'm laughing at Wen Wang..."

So, Wen Wang hid his world to avoid you. How can I not laugh?

"So, he secretly opened it, and you don't know the location?"

"Not really sure!"

Su Yu was convinced!

"Then it's hard for me to find it. Where should I even start looking?"

The Human Emperor sneered, "Scholars are all cunning. I suspect his world is right in the Myriad Realms. It can definitely be found. I'm just too lazy to look for it. You might be able to find it!"

That's hard to say.

The Human Emperor added, "Also, even if you can take your world with you, bringing it into the Heaven Gate isn't easy. It will be repelled! Our worlds are here! Don't move them easily. The Myriad Realms hold great opportunities!"

The Human Emperor said solemnly, "They're related to the River of Time and the Three Gates. I haven't figured it out after all these years, but there must be something. That's why the Three Gates want to return!"

Su Yu nodded. He had speculated about this as well.

At this moment, after chatting with the Human Emperor for a while, Su Yu was in a good mood. This person was quite forthcoming.

"Find Wen Wang's world, contact Wen Wang, seek opportunities in the Heaven Gate..."

Su Yu pondered for a while. Perhaps this was a path for him to improve next.

Otherwise, without absolute certainty, it was unrealistic to suppress the Myriad Races and launch another surprise attack.

And Gui might be able to provide some help.

Finding Wen Wang's world was troublesome. Why not let Gui find Wen Wang instead?

Of course, how to control Gui was a problem.

PS: It's really hard to get up in winter. Rushing to write in the morning is too hectic. Brothers, any suggestions? How about I stop updating in the morning and do three updates from afternoon to evening instead?
