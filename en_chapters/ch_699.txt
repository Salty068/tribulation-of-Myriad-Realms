Chapter 699: Scholars Advance Quickly (Subscription Requested)

"It's done!"

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng were both shocked and overjoyed. After experiencing despair, their eventual success filled them with immense excitement. Of course, if Lan Tian would just shut up, it would be even better. His piercing laughter was enough to make their ears ring.

At this moment, Lan Tian approached them step by step, his face alight with joy and excitement. With a coquettish smile, he said, "My dear treasures, come give me a kiss..."

Bang!

Su Yu threw a punch, and Wan Tiansheng also struck with a palm. This time, they couldn't tolerate this madman any longer.

With a thunderous boom, Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng both took a step back, while Lan Tian advanced a step, cackling, "My little darlings, your strength is lacking!"

Su Yu snorted, and Wan Tiansheng was speechless. They roughly gauged Lan Tian's strength; at the very least, he was at the peak of the second tier, or perhaps even at the Heavenly King level! Both Wan Tiansheng and Su Yu were at the third tier, possibly even at the peak of the third tier, yet together they couldn't push him back.

"Step aside!" Wan Tiansheng barked, quickly turning his attention to the Death Path, which was gradually being obscured by the river water. He spoke solemnly, "This place... the Death Path..."

Now that Lan Tian had succeeded, they had no interest in dealing with him. Instead, they were shocked to discover that the Death Path was buried beneath the riverbed. What did this imply?

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he chuckled, "The Death Path is still connected to the River of Time, continuously siphoning its power. The owner of this path is truly audacious, not fearing the river's backlash!"

With that, he quickly added, "Life and death are connected... life and death... I might have discovered something valuable!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, "Resurrection!"

Resurrection!

Wan Tiansheng's heart trembled slightly, and Su Yu's eyes shone brightly with a sharp gleam, "Yes, resurrection!"

"The most challenging aspect of the undead is that their path is integrated into the River of Death, making it difficult to separate! Once separated, it might even provoke a counterattack from the entire River of Death. But what if the shadow of the path is moved to the River of Time?"

Su Yu laughed, "In any case, it's an idea! The realms of life and death... they are indeed deeply intertwined!"

It seemed that the Death Path had not completely escaped the control of the River of Time. Whether it was unavoidable or the owner of the Death Path intended to continue siphoning power was unknown.

Without dwelling on it further, Su Yu, feeling exhausted, quickly said, "Let's go, let's explore the Death Path and see if we end up in the Death Realm. If we do, where is the source?"

With that, he punched away some of the river water, then used a small stone to stabilize the surrounding river, preventing it from becoming turbulent. Normally, one couldn't delve into the riverbed without drowning.

With the small stone, it was much safer. The three powerful figures, all top-tier existences of this era, including Lan Tian, refrained from causing trouble. The delicate balance between life and death was not to be trifled with.

At this moment, Su Yu, with his white hair and eyebrows, was observed by Wan Tiansheng and Lan Tian, who dared not waste his time. In the blink of an eye, the three of them swiftly dove into the black passageway at the riverbed.

...

Boom!

Death energy surged!

Su Yu and Lan Tian were fine, but Wan Tiansheng quickly retreated a step, his body emitting sizzling sounds as the death energy corroded him. At this moment, Wan Tiansheng didn't mind. Instead, his eyes lit up as he softly said, "Humans have the cycle of life and death, separation and reunion. Death is also a part of humanity, an emotion. I had overlooked this before!"

This time, he had gained much insight. After returning, he would absorb and digest it, undoubtedly making further progress in the path of humanity.

Having experienced hope, despair, a miraculous turnaround, a comrade paving the way, the cycle of life and death... all of this was an immense gain and experience for Wan Tiansheng. Normal people couldn't experience these things. From ancient times to the present, perhaps only a few had gone through such experiences. All of this was nourishment for the advancement of their paths.

Both Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng, including Lan Tian, had gained something. However, at this moment, they weren't too concerned about these gains. They needed to get out first!

As Su Yu opened his Heaven Gate, he observed the Death Path. The impact of the river water was much weaker compared to the River of Time above.

"Indeed, the Death Path is not as strong as the Time Path!" Su Yu mused. The River of Time was the number one path in the Myriad Realms!

Although Lan Tian had carved out a small path within the mainstream, compared to the vast river, his path was merely a narrow trail. It was still far from the entire River of Time. This path had great potential and prospects for the future, but for Su Yu, it wasn't much.

He aimed to reopen the myriad paths! To rebuild the River of Time! This vision was far more ambitious than Lan Tian's. Su Yu reminded himself not to be jealous or envious; Lan Tian's path was trash, nothing significant. The path he walked was the true path to the heavens!

No matter how fast Lan Tian progressed now, it was nothing. Soon, he would catch up and leave them in the dust!

"Let's go!" With a low shout, Su Yu didn't delay any longer. He and Wan Tiansheng couldn't afford to waste time.

This time, Lan Tian suddenly flew to the front, taking the initiative to lead the way. Su Yu said nothing, and the three of them quickly advanced.

Soon, Su Yu noticed something. With a glance at the riverbed, he saw some large droplets of water containing human figures. He smiled and ignored them.

Powerful beings! Strong entities of the Death Path. However, they had no time to deal with them now. The three of them quickly traversed the area. This place wasn't an exit; tearing through the river here might lead them directly to some top-tier undead, which would be a loss.

Su Yu planned to find a familiar place to exit. Soon, he sensed a familiar aura, the seed of his Death Path. With his Heaven Gate open, he carefully observed. In the river, a droplet had grown significantly larger, currently devouring some surrounding droplets.

Dragonblood Marquis!

Su Yu assessed the situation, his heart stirring. Indeed, this guy probably had the power of a second-tier marquis now. At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he had a chance to become a Heavenly King!

"This Myriad Realms, everyone is a thief, just a matter of who can steal more!" Su Yu suddenly felt a sense of realization. The Death Path siphoned power from the River of Time, Dragonblood Marquis and others extracted power from the Death Path, and he, in turn, siphoned power from them.

It truly was... a world of thieves.

With a smile, Su Yu quickly advanced. Soon, his eyes lit up as he saw a tributary, the only one—Mo Path!

Su Yu smiled and immediately said, "Let's exit through here! Lan Tian, if you see Liu Hong, capture him for me!"

"Is little Liu Hong here?" Lan Tian chuckled eerily, "It's been a while since I've seen him. I miss this little darling!"

He calls everyone little darling!

Su Yu was speechless. He couldn't quite determine Lan Tian's current state. They needed to get out first!

He was running out of strength!

"Suppress!" The small stone was thrown out, stabilizing the River of Death. Wan Tiansheng and the three of them simultaneously tore through the river, descending along the tributary.

With his Heaven Gate open, Su Yu flew in the direction of the tributary!

The three appeared, and while Su Yu and Lan Tian were fine, Wan Tiansheng, who didn't cultivate the Death Path, struggled to suppress his vitality. His injuries were severe, causing the nearby River of Death to become turbulent!

Inside, a strong presence seemed to be awakening.

The three of them ignored it.

At this moment, they saw a figure in the distance. Upon seeing them, the figure's face changed, and he was about to flee. In the next moment, countless figures appeared from all directions, interspersed with Lan Tian's various laughter, "Little darling, don't run, come play!"

The voice was like a demonic chant!

Liu Hong's face changed. Just as he was about to transform into an undead to escape, his hair stood on end. A towering Lan Tian appeared behind him, grabbing his neck and lifting him up, saying indifferently, "Little friend, don't move!"

Liu Hong was utterly shocked!

This was Lan Tian? So powerful!

He had managed to prove his path, and now he was considered a strong Eternal, yet he was captured just like that?

In the next moment, his face changed even more.

The first person he looked at was Su Yu. At this moment, Su Yu had white hair and eyebrows, his entire body snow-white. Liu Hong couldn't help but ask, "Did you dye your hair?"

After speaking, he realized something was wrong and was suddenly shocked, "Are you crazy? What did you do?"

It seemed that Su Yu had consumed too much life force, naturally resulting in white hair.

This... he was only in his early twenties!

With Su Yu's strength, living for tens of thousands of years should be easy, right?

To reach the point of white hair, one would have to live for seventy or eighty thousand years to have all their hair turn white.

Su Yu glanced at him, frowning, and coldly said, "Why run? Capturing you is a piece of cake! That Mo Path of yours is so conspicuous, do you think you can hide it from me?"

With a cold snort, Su Yu said coldly, "The path warns you, yet you didn't call me grandfather?"

"......"

Liu Hong opened his mouth, speechless for a long time.

Screw you!

"Divine punishment descends, and you don't take the path's warning seriously!"

Boom!

Five thunders struck!

Liu Hong's hair stood on end, struck by a bolt of lightning, charred black. Compared to Su Yu, one black and one white, it was enough to make children cry.

"Stop messing with me!" Liu Hong was on the verge of tears. How did he end up so unlucky, encountering these three?

Each of them exuded an overwhelming aura, making him feel immense pressure.

Su Yu chuckled, then quickly turned serious, "Mo Path alone, your comprehension is too poor, trash! A waste like you, how can you control the Mo Path? Even fusing with the path is difficult, let alone controlling it!"

With that, Su Yu looked at the Mo Path for a while before saying, "You are a living being, transformed into a half-undead. The intersection of life and death, here, you will never feel the meaning of life and death intersecting. Are you willing to become a complete undead?"

"No!" Liu Hong refused. He didn't want to die completely.

"Then go to the intersection!"

Su Yu spoke coldly, "Take control of the Ink Dao as soon as possible. In the depths of the Land of the Abyss, many formidable beings are sealed. Use your Ink Dao to erode them and find an opportunity to eliminate them! My true enemies lie in the Upper Realm, in ancient times, and in the depths of the River of Time. You must help me deal with the powerful foes of the Death Realm!"

With those words, he tore through the void, grabbing Liu Hong and heading deeper into the abyss.

Behind him, Lantian and Wan Tiansheng quickly followed. Lantian chuckled, "Are you going to play him to death? He's so weak, where are you throwing him?"

Wan Tiansheng hesitated, "Can he handle it?"

Su Yu smiled, "If he can't, he'll die! At this point, if he can't handle the Ink Dao, then let him die and I'll find someone else to take over!"

In Su Yu's grasp, Liu Hong was terrified. He couldn't help but exclaim, "Where are you taking me?"

Damn it! How did I get so unlucky? These guys are terrifying. Lantian and Wan Tiansheng have become so strong, and Su Yu is frighteningly powerful too.

Su Yu replied calmly, "To the Intersection of Life and Death. Haven't you understood? It's the connection point between the Death Dao and the River of Time! The Death Dao is a branch of the River of Time, and your Ink Dao is a branch of the Death Dao. You should understand this! I'm sending you there now. The cycle of life and death will help you comprehend the Dao better!"

"Don't waste my efforts. Although even a Heavenly King can easily fall there, I believe you won't die. I have full confidence in you."

"No!" Liu Hong was horrified. "Please, don't! Su Yu, we have some teacher-student relationship, right? Principal, Elder Lan, please persuade him not to do this!"

Are you kidding me? This is going to kill me!

Lantian laughed softly, "Go on, don't be afraid! We just came back from there. We almost got wiped out, but we didn't, right? Only Tiansheng was seriously injured, and Su Yu exhausted his lifespan. I'm fine, aren't I? Not only fine, but I also ascended to the Heavenly King realm in one step! You can do it too!"

The more they spoke, the more terrified Liu Hong became. They almost got wiped out! These three powerful beings almost got wiped out, and now you're throwing me there?

No way!

He was utterly horrified. "I really will die! Su Yu... no, Emperor Yu, please, I'll work for you, I'll fight the undead, just don't do this!"

"Play?" Su Yu looked down at him coldly. "Play what? In the face of great calamity, we dare to risk our lives. Why don't you dare? Why can't you? The Ink Dao, left by the Culture King to fight powerful enemies—do you want to inherit it or not? If not, I'll strip it from you! If you want it, then fight for it! If you die, you die. If not, then grow stronger for me!"

Su Yu's tone was icy. "The Ink Dao was given to you to play with slowly? The four Daos have appeared. I control the Pen Dao, Lantian controls the Paper Dao, the Great Xia King and Great Qin King control the Inkstone Dao, and you alone control the Ink Dao! The Great Xia King and Great Qin King together can rival the peak of Daofuse, even battle a Heavenly King. Lantian can fight a Heavenly King alone, and I'm almost there. But you, this useless one, can you even rival Daofuse?"

Liu Hong hesitated to speak.

"Don't talk about not having enough time. I have even less time than you!"

Su Yu snorted, "You're cowardly, always seeking stability! It seems flawless, but you've missed countless opportunities! In this era of great contention, if you don't fight, will you hide until the world ends?"

"The Intersection of Life and Death, this place is the greatest treasure in the world! Ordinary people want to go there, but even the rulers of laws have no chance. Only I can give you this opportunity, and you don't cherish it? I expend my lifespan to traverse the River of Time again, through countless crises, and you want to refuse?"

Su Yu's eyes were icy. "Tell me, do you want to go or not? If not, I'll sever your Dao, and you'll fall to the Sunmoon Realm, becoming an ordinary person! I won't even expect you to participate in the great war. Go wherever you want!"

"I'll find someone else brave enough to inherit the Ink Dao!"

Liu Hong opened his mouth, and after a long while, he said bitterly, "That's just my nature. You can't expect someone who schemes from behind to charge head-on!"

"Who have you schemed against?"

Su Yu said coldly, "With so many Daofuse in the Myriad Realms, have you schemed any of them to death?"

"…"

Liu Hong was embarrassed. This was true; he wasn't like this monster.

"Who can you scheme against with weak strength?"

Su Yu said coldly, "I'll ask you one more time, are you going or not?"

Liu Hong was bitter, and after a long while, he nodded, "I'll go, but... at least tell me the specifics, the retreat plan, I need to be fully prepared!"

"There is no retreat. If your comprehension isn't deep, you'll die. It's that simple!"

Crying!

Liu Hong was on the verge of collapse. This was not his style.

Su Yu quickly explained the Intersection of Life and Death briefly, and finally said, "Don't even think about walking back on your own, it's impossible! On the other side of the River of Time, once you enter, even a Heavenly King would die! As for the Death Dao, without my escort, you'd be devoured by countless powerful undead on the way! You can only survive by becoming strong, comprehending the Dao, avoiding everything, and returning to the Ink Dao!"

"The Intersection of Life and Death, the cycle of life and death, as long as your comprehension of the Dao deepens, you won't die so easily! It depends on your comprehension, your talent. If your talent is lacking, if your comprehension is lacking, then go die!"

Liu Hong was on the verge of tears!

Who did I provoke?

This is too much.

In that place, there's really no way out. Without comprehending the Dao, without strengthening oneself, he would soon perish at the Intersection of Life and Death.

And Su Yu, traveling swiftly, soon arrived at that place.

The end of the Dao!

A small stone suppressed the river's fluctuations, giving Su Yu another chance to reach the end.

At this moment, at the end of the river, life and death cycled, light and darkness intertwined.

Liu Hong looked, and even without opening the Heaven Gate, he felt two completely different forces, and he gasped, "This... if it gets slightly unbalanced, I'll surely die!"

"Exactly!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "So, you must control all the forces, don't let them get unbalanced, or you'll definitely die!"

Liu Hong smiled bitterly, "You're overestimating me!"

"No!"

Su Yu said calmly, "I'm not overestimating you, just thinking that if you can't do it, it's no loss if you die!"

"Alright!"

Liu Hong gave up struggling. The next moment, Su Yu threw him towards the end, and Liu Hong screamed, "At least give me some preparation time!"

Su Yu ignored him, and as he threw him, he grabbed the Hunting Heaven List from Lantian's hand. The list quickly disappeared into the river, faintly appearing near the Intersection of Life and Death.

"Let's go!"

Su Yu didn't say much, turned around, and left. Lantian and Wan Tiansheng quickly followed. Behind them, as Liu Hong fell, the impact of life and death caused him to spit out a mouthful of black blood. The next moment, his body was half-corroded, and he urgently said, "Leave me some treasures for repair, I really might die!"

"None, bear it yourself!"

"Damn!"

Liu Hong cursed, "You're really not human!"

The figures of Su Yu and the other two disappeared instantly.

And Liu Hong, unable to curse anymore, hurriedly began to adjust, maintaining the balance of life and death, cursing countless times in his heart.

These three bastards!

Just wait!

They're really not human, leaving me in this hellish place.

...

In the Celestial River of Death, Wan Tiansheng laughed, "Can he do it?"

"He can!" Su Yu nodded, "This guy is young, but he should have received some inheritance, a true Dao inheritance! With the Hunting Heaven List, if he's really about to die, it can bring him back."

Taking a deep breath, he continued, "We can't waste a single Dao's power. He controls the Ink Dao, and he's very cautious. He was probably secretly capturing undead monarchs just now, which is a method, but it's too slow!"

Liu Hong is very cautious. Just now, near the Celestial River of Death, he was probably secretly capturing some undead monarchs, encroaching on their Dao power to expand the influence of the Ink Dao.

But that's a method, but it's too slow, and on Su Yu's side, there's a Dragonblood Marquis, so Liu Hong doesn't need to be so cautious.

The fastest way to progress is at the Intersection of Life and Death, to comprehend the Dao and speed up.

Wan Tiansheng and Lantian said no more. Soon, they returned to the original place, tore through the river, and walked out.

This time, there were people here.

The South King, Marquis Lanshan, and others had arrived. They had sensed the aura of living beings just now, and now everyone was here.

Seeing Su Yu's appearance, the South King was shocked, "What happened to you?"

Marquis Lanshan was also visibly shaken, "Your Majesty!"

What happened!

At this moment, Su Yu was entirely snow-white, making Marquis Lanshan and the others feel extremely uneasy. Had he encountered a crisis?

Su Yu smiled, "It's nothing!"

The South King was shocked, and the next moment, suddenly looked at Lantian, even more shocked, "You... who are you?"

Lantian smiled, "Lantian, Deputy Director of the Purification Department!"

The South King recognized Wan Tiansheng and didn't mind, but seeing Lantian and hearing his self-introduction as Deputy Director, he was shocked.

This guy... how did Su Yu's side gain another top-tier expert!

Su Yu, however, had no time to waste and quickly said, "I need to return to the Human Realm to heal! Also, don't worry about the Land of the Abyss for now!"

Su Yu quickly added, "Also, drive all the unyielding strong ones in the Celestial River of Death to the Land of the Abyss!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "And, don't interfere in the battle in the Land of the Abyss, let them be! Don't think about taking advantage, without my orders, you're not allowed to enter the Land of the Abyss to fight!"

"Actively give the strong ones in the Celestial River of Death a path, even tell them to go to the Land of the Abyss, and I won't exterminate them. Otherwise, I will eventually clear out the strong ones in the river!"

Everyone listened carefully. At this moment, Su Yu gave them a different feeling than before.

Previously, Su Yu was domineering and arrogant, but there was some human touch. Now, even that human touch was dispelled by his snow-white appearance, giving everyone a deeper and more aloof feeling.

Su Yu paid no heed to these matters. His injuries were severe, and Wan Tiansheng was in a similar state. Even Lan Tian was not in great shape, needing time to stabilize his realm. Without lingering, Su Yu soared into the sky!

Lan Tian and Wan Tiansheng accompanied him, and the three of them vanished in an instant.

After they left, Marquis Lanshan suddenly remarked, "His Majesty... seems even more handsome than before... and more... more charming!"

She appeared somewhat starstruck, like a little fan girl.

The South King glanced at her, uninterested, and turned back to watch the disappearing figures. After a long pause, she spoke in a low voice, "Two individuals who have just opened their Daos, yet possess top-tier Daofuse combat strength. This era... is truly fascinating!"

She could tell that both had only recently opened their Daos. Yet, one possessed top-tier Daofuse combat strength, and the other even had the power of a Heavenly King. It was truly terrifying!

...

In the Realm of Living Beings.

The Blood Path had vanished.

There was no movement.

The myriad realms were watching, wondering what the outcome would be. Where were they? Where had they gone? It seemed as if Su Yu and his companions had disappeared.

In the Eastern Rift Valley, the Great Zhou King and others were heavy-hearted. Where were they? The Blood Path had disappeared, but the people were nowhere to be found. Had they died?

Probably not. If they had died, there would have been some commotion. But there was none, indicating they were still alive. If they were alive, why hadn't they returned?

What was Lan Tian's current situation?

As they pondered, suddenly, a massive blood cloud gathered in the sky above the Sea of Stars. It wasn't a sign of someone's fall but more like a punishment from the rules!

At that moment, a figure appeared, chuckling, "Oh, there's a punishment? Disperse already. Punish me? I haven't done anything wrong, really!"

As the words fell, the figure scattered instantly, and in a flash, the entire world was filled with Lan Tians.

Countless Lan Tians!

Some of these Lan Tians vanished into small realms, some dove into the Sea of Stars, and some scattered into ancient cities, disappearing in a flash, leaving no one able to capture his presence.

The next moment, a bewitching Lan Tian, drawing the blood cloud, appeared in the Eastern Rift Valley.

The Great Zhou King's heart trembled. So fast!

Yet Lan Tian smiled charmingly, "Want to play with the thunder tribulation?"

"......"

Silence.

A group of people looked at him, utterly uninterested. They had no desire to play such games.

The Great Xia King and the Great Qin King also watched him. The Great Qin King asked solemnly, "Did you succeed?"

"Of course!"

Lan Tian giggled, transforming into a little girl, suddenly raising a lollipop and shouting dramatically, "Oh, living beings, grant me strength! I'm on your side, so let's all go home!"

Rumble!

The blood cloud suddenly began to disperse, transforming into dozens of strands of the power of laws. At this moment, the blood cloud seemed confused about whom to attack.

"Disperse already. Brother Emperor Yu said not to waste the power of the thunder tribulation!"

Lan Tian laughed mischievously, leaping into the blood cloud as if to soothe it. Gradually, the blood cloud began to dissipate, leaving the onlookers shivering.

Lan Tian giggled, suddenly pointing at someone in the crowd, "What are you doing?"

He vanished instantly, reappearing in front of someone, his small stature only reaching the other's waist, holding a lollipop against the person's waist, looking angry, "What are you doing?"

The person he was confronting was none other than Little Zhou King, Zhou Tianyuan, who was bewildered. Quickly realizing something, he said, "I... sent a message to Po Long, saying you all had returned..."

"Oh!"

Lan Tian took a bite of his lollipop, suddenly disappearing, and after a moment, as if following some line, he returned, giggling, "Bad guy, don't call Lan Tian a pervert next time, or I'll get mad! You actually told your son that the big pervert Lan Tian is back. You're so bad!"

Horrified!

Zhou Tianyuan looked at him in shock. Lan Tian giggled, "What's up! I just followed your message path and intercepted the information. Your son won't hear it! Next time, don't say such things. I'm a good kid!"

Zhou Tianyuan's mouth hung open, looking towards the Great Zhou King, who was equally shocked, "You... you can even intercept messages?"

"What about it?"

Lan Tian giggled, "As long as I run fast enough, the myriad realms are mine, and all beings are me. Of course, I can intercept anytime! Everyone, be good, don't curse me, and don't spread false messages!"

"......"

A group of people was horrified. Was there any justice left in this world?

In the future, if we send a message, this guy can know everything?

This was too terrifying!

The Great Zhou King took a deep breath, "You are faster than the speed of messaging. This... what realm have you reached?"

"Oh, very weak!"

Lan Tian giggled, glancing at the Great Zhou King, "I can hit you, you know. Want me to give it a try?"

"......"

Powerless.

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, "No need, congratulations!"

A terrifying fellow. What kind of Dao had he opened?

"Hehe, then forget it!"

The Great Zhou King felt exhausted and asked, "What about Emperor Yu and Director Wan?"

Lan Tian pouted, "They're injured, very badly, almost dying! Emperor Yu said he's dying and wants to find someone to succeed him. Great Zhou King, how about you take over?"

"......"

The Great Zhou King felt even more exhausted, powerless, "No, I'll wait for them to return!"

I don't believe your nonsense!

This guy is really not a good person.

Lan Tian had become even more perverse, but that wasn't the main issue. The main issue was that he was terrifying.

He could even intercept messages. What a frightening guy.

What kind of Dao had he opened this time?

Why was he so ridiculously powerful?

Around them, others were also pondering. As for Su Yu being injured and dying, they dismissed it as nonsense. Who would believe that?

Lan Tian didn't elaborate, and they didn't press further.

After all, for powerful beings, disappearing for a few days or even months wasn't unusual. Su Yu had disappeared for several months before.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was indeed healing.

He and Wan Tiansheng hadn't returned but were recuperating in Grand Dream City.

This time, both were severely injured.

However, it wasn't a fundamental injury. The most serious issue was Su Yu's significant lifespan consumption. At this moment, Su Yu's hair was white, which left Hongmeng somewhat shocked and inexplicably moved.

Su Yu, however, was calm. Having recovered somewhat, he sipped tea and, noticing Hongmeng's constant gaze, couldn't help but smile, "It's nothing. I think I can live for over a hundred more years! A hundred years is enough for me to settle everything! Once everything is settled, lifespan will be a minor issue. By then, I'll surely have reached the realm of a master of laws, and living for another ten or twenty thousand years won't be difficult!"

"But..."

Old Turtle was still visibly shaken, "Is it worth it?"

"What?"

"Is it worth it to do this?"

Hongmeng said solemnly, "Lan Tian opening his Dao, no matter how strong, is still Lan Tian, not you!"

Su Yu laughed, "That's quite a statement!"

Taking a sip of tea, Su Yu chuckled, "In the struggle of the Great Dao, strong individuals are as numerous as clouds. I hope to see the elites of the myriad races emerge, and I also hope that my comrades can stand by my side in the final moment, fighting alongside me!"

Su Yu was exceedingly carefree, smiling, "Helping him open his Dao is actually perfecting my own Dao! I'm too young, with limited experiences. Should I just imagine things without witnessing or learning more? This time, I've gained a lot of insights into the Great Dao! Such gains can't be achieved through a lifetime of seclusion!"

"The higher you stand, the farther you see. If I have a few more experiences like this, perhaps I can open my own Dao."

Su Yu smiled, "In truth, I haven't sacrificed much. Senior Hongmeng thinks I've given too much, but for me, a hundred years is enough!"

Hongmeng was speechless.

After a moment, he raised his teacup, "With tea instead of wine, I toast Emperor Yu!"

"No need for such courtesy!"

Su Yu laughed, raising his teacup and drinking it in one go. Looking up, he smiled, "Senior, your recent insights into the Great Dao are not bad, but... you're still lacking a suitable opponent to compete with you!"

Hongmeng nodded.

Su Yu smiled, "Go play in the Celestial River of Death, sweep through it, and drive out those resurrected powerhouses to the Land of the Abyss! Those unwilling to leave, hiding and sneaking around, kill them all!"

Hongmeng considered for a moment and said solemnly, "Once they gather in the Land of the Abyss, or join the North King's forces..."

At that point, it would be a tail too big to wag!

Su Yu laughed, "No worries! Even if the North King's forces can match ours, they won't return to the Four Kings' Domains immediately. They'll have internal strife first, needing to choose a new leader!"

"A new leader?"

Old Turtle pondered the meaning of these words, didn't ask further, and nodded, "Alright, I'll sweep through the Celestial River soon and drive out the powerhouses."

"Mm."

Su Yu smiled, continued sipping his tea, and after some thought, added, "Shan Qi and the others have reached the Daofuse Realm, but many of the guardians are stuck at the ninth stage. In the lower realm, it's difficult to advance! I'll find an opportunity to explore the Upper Realm. If possible, I'll take them there for some battles, which might help them improve."

Su Yu quickly said, "In the lower realm, with the three realms sealed, it's hard to find opponents now!"

"Can you go up?"

"I'll give it a try!"

Su Yu smiled, "Last time, a few people came from the Upper Realm, all humans, and they were only at the Eternal level, yet they came. With me here, I should be able to go up! I'll first go up and scout the situation!"

"Then... be careful. I probably can't go up. I'm a guardian and can't leave this realm, though I can enter the Death Realm."

Su Yu nodded. He hadn't thought much about it and hadn't planned on taking Old Turtle with him.

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Even if I go, I won't take too many powerhouses, to prevent the lower realm from discovering anything and Tiangu from causing trouble!"

With that, Su Yu finished his tea and smiled, "I'll take another walk on the pen dao. I've gained a lot of insights this time, and maybe I can advance further. Just yesterday, I made some progress. Indeed, life-and-death crises are the best way to improve."

Yes, just yesterday.

Su Yu had walked the pen dao yesterday, and today, he wanted to try again.

This time, as Su Yu safeguarded the path for the Blue Sky, he felt a deep sense of connection. Similarly, so did Old Wan.

After a brief rest, Su Yu swiftly entered the River of Time. In the past, reaching the pen dao was somewhat challenging, but now, it was effortlessly close. This time, Su Yu had ventured far, and upon seeing the pen dao, it seemed so near—what was it even worth?

Su Yu's physical body easily traversed the pen dao, quickly entering its tributary. As he stepped into the pen dao, various insights flooded his mind. The pen dao excelled in attack and sealing. In truth, this path might not be the most suitable for Su Yu, but he was determined to comprehend myriad paths. Not being adept at something didn't mean he couldn't understand it.

"The pen dao is merely what the Culture King called it. It doesn't have to be taken literally as a pen. It can also be understood as moving forward, continuously advancing! This symbol '↑' inherently holds infinite meanings!"

Everyone has their own insights, and this time, Su Yu freed himself from some of the Culture King's thoughts. Just because the Culture King said this path was good at sealing and breaking attacks, did it have to be so? Not necessarily!

With his own insights, Su Yu proceeded along the path, the power of laws around him seemed to cheer and dance. At this moment, Su Yu finally broke free from some of the Culture King's influence. The Culture King was, after all, human. What he thought didn't necessarily represent Su Yu's thoughts.

Strictly speaking, Su Yu wasn't a direct successor of the Culture King. He felt he belonged more to the legacy of the Time Sage. With some unique insights of his own, Su Yu advanced smoothly. This time, he reached about 75% of the great path, with roughly 75% integration into the dao. His understanding of the rules deepened!

Perhaps his insights differed from the Culture King's, but the power of the great path, despite its myriad changes, remained fundamentally the same. It could be interpreted from different perspectives.

As Su Yu emerged from the River of Time, Old Turtle was somewhat dazed. At this moment, he vaguely felt that Su Yu might have reached a level that shocked him—not surpassing Old Turtle, but rapidly approaching his realm!

At this point, Su Yu himself felt it too. He might have officially stepped into the second-tier Daofuse realm. Old Turtle, Tiangu, the Great Zhou King, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis... These individuals were previously in this realm. Of course, now Old Turtle and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, including Tiangu, might have already surpassed this category, vaguely advancing towards the Heavenly King level.

But Su Yu was catching up quickly! These top-tier experts of the lower realm were being rapidly overtaken by him.

"Shouldn't be worse than Doubao, right?" Su Yu thought to himself. Maybe just a bit lacking? Who cares! Anyway, Su Yu felt that he should be slightly stronger than the Great Qin King and the others. Indeed, warriors were just warriors; their progress was slow. Unlike us scholars, who gain strength with each insight!

With a smile, Su Yu soon saw Wan Tiansheng emerging from seclusion in the distance. They exchanged a glance and both smiled.

This time, both had gained something. Su Yu wasn't too aware of Wan Tiansheng's gains, but seeing Old Wan's sly smile, it was clear he had gained quite a bit.

We scholars, it's normal to keep happy things to ourselves, as long as we don't spill the beans. That's good.

The next moment, the two traversed through time and space, heading towards the Human Realm. Su Yu was preparing to take a look at the path to the Upper Realm!

...

At this very moment, in the endless darkness, a white-robed expert's eyes flickered with a strange light. What was going on? In his perception, just moments ago, the inheritor of the pen dao had improved by a notch, and then again by another notch!

"Is the pen dao so easy to comprehend?" The white-robed expert was somewhat dazed. Strange, did I sense it wrong? Perhaps, being so far away, I must have sensed it incorrectly.

With a light sigh and a smile, perhaps he was just too tired, too exhausted. In the distance, the rumbling resumed. The white-robed expert laughed freely and went into battle! Damn it, if I'm having a hard time, none of you should have it easy. Do you really think I'm a pushover?

With a hint of killing intent, the white-robed expert swiftly vanished!
