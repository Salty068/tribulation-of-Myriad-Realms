Chapter 739: Picking Up a Bone

"Where to now?" Lantian asked as they emerged from the Space Ancient Beast Race's domain. "You're May now, and I'm Full Moon. We still need to hurry back."

"No rush," Su Yu replied with a smile. "Isn't it ten days? Only one day has passed, so why hurry?"

He quickly added, "First, let's find Xia Longwu and the others. We can't afford to lose them!"

Last time, they brought some people up, including Hu Xiansheng, who was with Marquis Dingjun's daughter. Xia Longwu had also left alone, and the Extermination King and several other guardians were missing. Now that several Heavenly Sovereigns had noticed them, they needed to gather everyone and leave promptly.

"True!" Lantian chuckled. "We need to find the Extermination King. He seems quite afraid of me."

"..." Su Yu ignored him. Who wouldn't be wary of Lantian?

Lantian continued, "Aren't you worried that Marquis Liekong might betray us?"

Su Yu laughed, "Even if he does, what can we do? At this point, whether we're afraid or not, we have to proceed. Director Wan and the others have gone to Chaos Mountain. Even if we're betrayed, they should have some means of defense. If not... well, it would be hard to continue the fight."

Su Yu sighed, "Inaccurate intelligence can be deadly! I thought the Upper Realm had seventy or eighty Daofuse Realm experts and three to five Heavenly Kings. Wasn't that supposed to be easy for me to handle? But now... these old relics, why are they all emerging in my era?"

Seventy or eighty Daofuse Realm experts? More like three to five hundred! As for the Heavenly Kings, eleven have already died, and there are likely around thirty more, not counting any more that might emerge. There could be as many as fifty!

And the Heavenly Sovereigns? Nine have already appeared, and there might be more. Definitely more than ten!

Only one Heavenly Sovereign among the God Race? I don't believe it! Do the Dragon and Phoenix Races really have no Heavenly Sovereigns left? I don't believe it!

Su Yu was speechless at those who provided the intelligence. Even if many had advanced over the past six thousand years, many old relics were hiding, and those who didn't mention them are truly despicable.

"War is fought with intelligence!" Su Yu remarked. "Without accurate intelligence, how can we fight? Fortunately, the myriad races are now revealing their cards. Otherwise, we'd be doomed by those bastards!"

Lantian chuckled, "There's no helping it. This era is too interesting, and all the hidden ones are coming out! It's good; we can settle everything at once and avoid future troubles."

"Easier said than done!" Su Yu shook his head. It's easy to say, but not so easy to do.

Su Yu stopped discussing this and quickly said, "We still need to strengthen ourselves and weaken the enemy! The Chaos Dao is worth studying. Once we stir up the Upper Realm, we can return to the Lower Realm and study it thoroughly!"

"Do you have a plan?"

"Not yet," Su Yu shook his head. "This time, the focus is on gathering intelligence, understanding the strengths of both sides, and finding out how many we can kill!"

"I'm worried that if we kill too many, both sides will target us!" Lantian said with a sly smile. "Why not focus on one side? We've already killed many strong experts from the myriad races. This time, I suggest we target the Control King's lineage, making the myriad races think we're fighting among ourselves!"

It was an unpleasant analogy, but it was true. When weak, fighting both sides makes one an easy target.

Lantian continued, "Although we've killed some Heavenly Kings from the myriad races, they might think we did it to frame the Control King's lineage. If we continue targeting them, the myriad races will believe our goal is the Control King's lineage! If their strength grows, the myriad races will be happy to see us tear each other apart!"

Lantian's smile turned cold, "I believe the Control King's lineage is more terrifying than the myriad races! The myriad races are not a single entity. Even if the three major races are united, they are not one. But the Control King's lineage is different. Just look at their attack on the Nether Race. They are strictly hierarchical and follow orders, much like us!"

"A disorganized mob is not scary, even if strong. What's scary is a structured, hierarchical group! So, if I had to choose, even if the Control King's lineage's strength is unclear, I fear them more!"

Lantian's voice grew colder, "Moreover, they are skilled in ambushes. Their stealth formations are terrifying. The stronger they are, the more terrifying they become! The Nether Race's two Heavenly Kings were hiding elsewhere and were still discovered, indicating they have the ability to detect the Great Dao! This overlaps with our abilities, making them extremely troublesome!"

Lantian listed the difficulties of dealing with the Control King's lineage, even though they had only seen the tip of the iceberg. He believed the immediate priority was to deal with the Control King's lineage, not the myriad races.

"Even if the myriad races have ten or twenty Heavenly Sovereigns, so what?" Lantian sneered. "To put it bluntly, if the Martial Emperor from the Luminous Domain Mansion emerges, he might just kill them all! Would he hesitate to kill the myriad races? I don't think so! But would he kill the Control King's lineage? Why would he? He might even feel a kinship with them, sharing a common enemy, and end up killing us instead!"

This point was a reminder to Su Yu. If the Martial Emperor emerges, who would he help? Naturally, helping the Control King's lineage would be more satisfying! They are all enemies of the Culture King and his allies, and the Martial Emperor, who considers himself a human, might want to eliminate the remnants left by the Martial King. Would he kill Su Yu instead of the Culture King's enemies?

The enemy of my enemy is my friend!

Su Yu's expression changed slightly.

Lantian's laughter turned cold, "Emperor Yu, I'm suggesting that we shouldn't really consider the myriad races as enemies. They might even be our allies!"

Su Yu squinted, taking a moment before speaking, "You're suggesting I help the myriad races fight the human race? Even if they no longer consider themselves human, you're truly... rotten to the core."

Lantian's cold tone vanished instantly, replaced by a playful giggle, "Why would Emperor Yu say that about me? I'm just reminding you not to misidentify the target. The Control King's lineage is more troublesome than the myriad races!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. Ten thousand years... how much strength have they accumulated in these ten thousand years? And the Gate of Hell, with the Control King guarding it for a thousand years, what connection does it have with their retreat to Chaos Mountain?

The Control King's lineage has an ancestral command not to let the Culture King return! Left by the Control King! This implies the Control King might know where the Culture King is and what happened to him. Was the Culture King's downfall orchestrated by the Control King?

Thoughts swirled in Su Yu's mind. The Human Emperor and the Four Extremes Human Kings were the most talented and powerful figures of their time, suppressing over a hundred rule masters from the myriad races. Even when the myriad races united, they were still defeated by the human race. Why did the Control King betray them?

The Culture King punished him... even if the Culture King was stronger, the Human Emperor agreed to the punishment. What crime did the Control King commit?

A tangled mess!

Moreover, the Control King's lineage has a blood relation with the Demon Emperor...

Su Yu couldn't help but gossip. Could it be that humans and demons were forbidden to marry, leading to a tragic love story? Was the Culture King the one who broke up the lovers, causing the Control King to rebel?

For love... did he want to eliminate the Culture King and his allies?

How touching!

As he was lost in thought, Su Yu suddenly traversed the void, appearing in a location where he grabbed someone. The person's face changed, but upon seeing Su Yu, they relaxed.

"Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu smiled, "Extermination King, how's the harvest?"

The Extermination King smiled but then frowned upon seeing Lantian, who had transformed into a woman, and gritted his teeth, "Enough!"

Lantian pouted, "Ah Hu, what's wrong?"

"..." The Extermination King was about to explode. Su Yu cleared his throat, "Enough, will angering the Extermination King do you any good?"

"..." The Extermination King gritted his teeth in frustration, "Emperor Yu, keep that guy away from me. I don't want to be near him!"

Su Yu laughed and nodded, "Alright, you can go play in the Mark of Civilization! By the way, disguise yourself as someone from the Control King's lineage and chat with that Wen Qi. Just say you were captured by me... you have the Control King's bloodline, so disguising yourself shouldn't be a problem. Test him out. If there's an issue, we should deal with it early. The Mark of Civilization is becoming quite a melting pot!"

The Extermination King, having endured Lantian's torment, was overjoyed at the suggestion. Without needing further encouragement, he eagerly said, "Understood, Wen Qi, right? Emperor Yu, tell me more about the situation, and I'll give deception a try!"

Su Yu briefly explained, and the Extermination King was delighted, "I can do this..."

Lantian pouted, "You're so clumsy. Can you really do it?"

"Shut up!" The Extermination King was annoyed. Although he knew Lantian was powerful, he couldn't suppress his anger!

With Emperor Yu present, he could vent a little. What could Lantian do?

Of course, if Su Yu wasn't around... well, he'd keep his distance from Lantian.

Lantian giggled, not taking offense.

The Extermination King, however, was chilled by Lantian's laughter and quickly entered the Mark of Civilization. The more Lantian laughed, the more terrified he became. He'd rather Lantian get angry at him.

...

Once the Extermination King was inside, Su Yu smiled, then quickly turned serious, "Enough fooling around. We're all on the same side. Don't push people to the point of rebellion! The Control King was once a pillar of the human race, and he betrayed us in the end."

Lantian's smile froze for a moment before he nodded slightly. "True... But that Extermination King, he lacks both the capital and the wisdom to betray. I think the most likely to betray is still the Great Zhou King!"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless. Are you really picking a fight with the Great Zhou King?

Lantian chuckled softly, "Those who betray are often the smart ones. Fools rarely betray! Among us, the Great Zhou King has the highest betrayal coefficient, Wan Tiansheng is second, and I rank third. If Emperor Yu guards against the three of us, there shouldn't be much of a problem."

Su Yu suddenly smiled.

Lantian also smiled, "Why are you laughing, Emperor Yu?"

Su Yu replied, "It's nothing. I just thought, if the three of you do betray... it doesn't really matter. You can play your games on your own! I won't join you. There's so much more fun in this world. Why bother with betrayal after betrayal, not even knowing for whom in the end! The Human Emperor did it for responsibility, but I didn't. Since I embarked on this path, it has never been about responsibility. It's always been about following my heart!"

Following my heart!

Lantian silently repeated the words. How difficult that is!

In this world full of powerful beings and countless trivial matters, how can everything go as one wishes? Su Yu's pursuit is even harder than the Human Emperor's. Even the Human Emperor couldn't achieve everything he wished for!

...

Su Yu continued to gather people.

Marquis Giant Bamboo was also helping with the task.

With Lantian's avatars providing locations, finding people wasn't difficult.

The second person they found was Zhou Tianyuan, the Little Zhou King. In just a short time, his aura had grown much stronger, almost surpassing the Extermination King, who was close to advancing to the seventh stage of the Eternal realm.

Both were nearing the seventh stage.

The third group they found included Nan Wujian and Yun Chen, both carrying significant injuries. When Su Yu found them, they were being pursued.

...

One by one, people were found and gathered.

The Guardians returned to their posts, until Hu Xiansheng and Yuexi were brought by Marquis Giant Bamboo. Adding Xia Longwu to the mix, Su Yu did a headcount, his expression turning slightly odd.

"What's wrong?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo, who had just made contact, noticed Su Yu's changing expression and couldn't help but ask.

Su Yu frowned slightly, taking a moment before saying, "Someone's missing!"

"Dead?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo consoled, "It's normal. Death is normal..."

"No, missing!"

He looked at Lantian, who also frowned, "Yes, missing. My avatar suddenly vanished."

"Who went missing?"

Xia Longwu, who had just returned and whose aura was much stronger than before, asked, "Is the Extermination King missing?"

"It's not him."

Su Yu shook his head, speaking softly, "Changhe is missing!"

Changhe of the Fate Clan!

They had found Tun Tian, but Changhe was nowhere to be seen.

"Changhe?"

Xia Longwu's expression shifted, "Did he... defect?"

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then shook his head, "Hard to say! Maybe... someone took him away!"

Su Yu squinted, "The words Tian Ce relayed to me earlier were all from Destiny Marquis. Destiny Marquis seems to know a lot, even seeing through some things. If he can see through us... could Changhe, this Fate Clan genius, carrying the Fate Emperor's token to the Upper Realm, really be unaware?"

He suspected that Changhe had been taken by Destiny Marquis!

Even though Destiny Marquis seemed to still be moving mountains... a non-Daofuse like Changhe, even if just an avatar, could be easily taken away.

Everyone else was fine, but this Fate Clan guy, Changhe, was missing.

Su Yu exhaled, "Forget it, whether he's been taken or is dead... there's nothing we can do."

Marquis Giant Bamboo said gravely, "But what if he wasn't taken by the Fate Clan and was instead captured by someone else? Wouldn't our plans, including those concerning the Lower Realm, be exposed?"

Su Yu shook his head, "Unlikely. I've placed some power of laws in their sea of will, which can be easily triggered! It's impossible to probe their memories unless... Changhe voluntarily reveals everything, and then there's nothing I can do!"

"Now, that power of laws is also being blocked, and I can't pinpoint his location... It must be a strong individual, as ordinary people can't block my tracking."

Changhe was missing!

Was Su Yu worried?

A little.

But he guessed that it was more likely the Fate Clan's doing. Destiny Marquis, that old cunning fox, might have known something long ago. Taking Changhe away now might be to learn more.

Beside him, Lantian also frowned, speaking in a low voice, "Emperor Yu, you can't place everything on the assumption that the Fate Clan will help us. We must consider the possibility that Changhe reveals everything and Destiny Marquis secretly informs everyone, plotting against us!"

One cannot entrust their fate to others!

Now is not like before. Back then, it was a gamble with life. Now, safety is the priority.

"At most, the Lower Realm's situation will be exposed..."

"Changhe knows the location of the Lower Realm's passage!"

Lantian said solemnly, "That's the key!"

The news about the Lower Realm, if known, is known. There's no way to contact the Lower Realm anyway.

The fear is that the passage at Soul Burying Mountain will be discovered, which would be the most troublesome.

If Changhe voluntarily reveals it, Su Yu had only set up a passive memory search method, without any means to prevent voluntary disclosure.

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, then quickly chuckled, "I've set some traps over there. If someone really discovers it, I'll know! If it comes to that... I'll descend through the River of Time and wipe out the Fate Clan first!"

"By then, it might be too late..."

"Too late for what?"

Su Yu laughed, "If necessary, we'll fight a battle in the Lower Realm first! As long as the strong aren't dead, who would kill the weak first? If the myriad races really wipe out the Human Race, they better be prepared for us to hide and occasionally kill their weaklings. Who can afford that?"

The war among the Myriad Realms is like this: as long as the strong in a race aren't mostly dead, few will target the weak.

Genocide is rare.

Genocide only happens when the opposing strong are mostly dead and the remaining ones can't stir up trouble.

Lantian said nothing more, just took a deep breath, his eyes glinting with a cold light.

My avatar was destroyed!

If it's the Fate Clan... no matter what Destiny Marquis plans, we'll see!

Su Yu also suppressed his irritation.

Changhe's disappearance left him feeling uneasy.

If it was done by another race and Changhe didn't voluntarily reveal anything, the power of laws wasn't triggered, meaning they hadn't learned anything. The fear was Changhe voluntarily revealing information.

If it was the Fate Clan... then Changhe might voluntarily disclose information, especially about the passage at Soul Burying Mountain.

He had been somewhat careless in this regard.

He hadn't considered everything thoroughly!

Everyone who ascended that day knew the exact location of the passage.

No one is perfect, and Su Yu isn't a god. He wouldn't have considered the possibility of Changhe's betrayal from the start. If he couldn't trust someone, he wouldn't have brought them up.

Licking his lips, Su Yu chuckled, a bit relieved, "Whatever! If the Lower Realm passage is discovered, then we'll have a big fight! Whoever descends, we'll deal with them!"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "I don't just control one Lower Realm passage!"

Lantian also chuckled, "True! Those with nothing to lose aren't afraid of those with something to lose! We're... still barefoot!"

"Alright, enough of this!"

Su Yu cut off the topic, looking at Xia Longwu and the others, "Enter the Mark of Civilization first. It seems some Guardians have a chance to advance... but now isn't the time!"

"Marquis Giant Bamboo, you handle the migration and cover up our absence."

"......"

After giving a few instructions, Marquis Giant Bamboo quickly left.

Xia Longwu and the others, without further ado, swiftly entered the Mark of Civilization.

Su Yu, looking eastward, smiled, "Let's head to the Source of the Dao! While the Heavenly Sovereigns are still moving mountains, let's go check the situation. Today, we'll open the Heaven Gate, boldly and without restraint, and see what we can find!"

Nine Heavenly Sovereign-level experts have left!

Even if there are still some in the Source of the Dao, how many could there be?

Now, with most of the strong having left the Source of the Dao, the numbers are sparse, making it the perfect time for a large-scale investigation.

...

Source of the Dao.

The light curtain enveloped the area, as mysterious as ever.

On this vast land, countless heroes have been buried. Some died of old age in this sacred place, while others, unable to advance, chose to rest here.

A hundred thousand years!

Some who had little lifespan left at the end of the ancient era may have long since died here.

Daofuse, with a lifespan of just over a hundred thousand years.

Take Su Yu, for example. His lifespan is actually just over a hundred thousand years. Having burned much of it to open the path for Lantian, without becoming a master of laws, he might never increase his lifespan!

And the ancient era disappeared over a hundred thousand years ago.

Some strong individuals from the ancient times, who lived for tens of thousands of years, even with their extended lifespan due to deepening Dao, couldn't hold on until now.

The older generation, many of them can't hold on anymore!

In Su Yu's era, many old strong individuals emerged, unable to sit still any longer, choosing to come out.

Lifespan, a joke a hundred thousand years ago.

With over a hundred thousand years left to live, worrying about lifespan is laughable, isn't it?

Cultivators rarely worry about these things, especially those who have reached the Eternal realm, where almost no one dies of old age.

Sunmoon might still have a chance!

But now, dying of old age seems like something that could happen at any moment, including the Heavenly Kings Su Yu killed last time at Sealed Mountain. Each one was very decrepit, and if a few more centuries passed, they wouldn't need Su Yu to kill them; they'd die of old age themselves!

...

Su Yu returned to the Source of the Dao.

The Starry Sky Seal suppressed the light curtain's agitation, making the entire Source of the Dao much quieter, almost desolate.

Many strong individuals had withdrawn from the Source of the Dao, choosing to leave.

The fall of many Heavenly Kings last time made some Daofuse feel the crisis.

With the news from Chaos Mountain, more and more Daofuse were flying out.

As soon as Su Yu entered, a powerful aura erupted in the distance. A formidable presence tore through the earth, exuding a fierce energy, and roared, "Nonsense! Participating in the Myriad Race Council and relocating the Dao Field? Ridiculous! Our race has stood in the Upper Realm for countless ages; how can we casually relocate our Dao Field?"

Clearly, this was an ancient being that had just awakened, brimming with anger, and swiftly flew away accompanied by a Daofuse cultivator.

Su Yu observed from afar, raising an eyebrow slightly. "A Heavenly King-level being!"

Lantian nodded, smiling. "It seems... it's from the recorded Gluttonous Race."

Su Yu glanced at the powerful figure and nodded slightly. "It does resemble the records. There don't seem to be any left in the Lower Realm, right?"

"They're gone from the Lower Realm. According to records, they were wiped out in the Third Tide! There might still be some in the Upper Realm, but not many..."

"Mm."

The two discussed as they watched the newly awakened Heavenly King. It was quite a stroke of luck to encounter such a being right after arriving. However, Su Yu had no interest in confronting it; there was no need. This race was of average strength in the Upper Realm, and now that this old Gluttonous had awakened, it might be going to cause trouble for the three major races. Watching the spectacle was enough.

Su Yu's Heaven Gate manifested as he chuckled, "If the myriad races want me to help them find people, I can sweep through inch by inch. No matter how strong they are, I'll flush them out!"

Lantian laughed heartily. "Is that even possible?"

Su Yu scanned the area, raising an eyebrow slightly. "There are indeed fewer people now. Previously, a quick scan would reveal several Daofuse cultivators. Now, I can barely sense one in the distance. No wonder the awakening of a Heavenly King didn't cause much of a stir."

Normally, the revival of a Heavenly King would at least provoke some Daofuse cultivators to release their auras and come to investigate. Of course, investigating carries risks, so it's best not to get involved.

Lantian chuckled, unconcerned. "Fewer is fewer."

Su Yu continued to probe forward, examining inch by inch. He was curious about how many people were hiding in this ghostly place. Previously, with nine Heavenly Sages present, he couldn't look too closely. Now, he could be a bit more reckless.

His eyes revealed a world different from others. Su Yu himself now possessed quasi-king combat power, and when probing the Heavenly Sages, they might not even notice.

However, the Dao Source Land was truly vast!

Su Yu pondered for a moment before saying, "Let's first enter the River of Time and see if there are any pseudo-Dao experts left!"

True Dao experts are hard to find. But pseudo-Dao experts, even if they're in slumber, can be dug out! As long as they have this path, even if they're not connected, the path exists in the River of Time. The Human Emperor's path isn't too long, and it can't compare to the River of Time of the Myriad Realms. I can find them by probing bit by bit.

Lantian had no objections. Here, Su Yu was much more capable than him.

Soon, Su Yu dove into the River of Time.

...

Su Yu entered and started checking from the severed end. Quickly, with Lantian, he used the Starry Sky Seal to suppress the power of laws, running all the way to the end before returning to probe bit by bit.

Where there are tributaries, there are pseudo-Dao.

If a pseudo-Dao expert has left the Dao Source Land, their path would be visible if there's no one nearby and the path is severed. If they haven't left... it means they're still here.

Pseudo-Dao also depends on how much the person has fused. This can generally be seen. If the fusion isn't much, it's Eternal, not worth much attention. The focus is on those with extensive fusion, even those on the verge of mastery, which indicates they're either Daofuse, Heavenly King, or even Heavenly Sage-level experts.

Su Yu wasn't afraid of pseudo-Dao Heavenly Sages! In a real fight, if he suppresses them, the outcome... is likely in his favor. Why fear?

After a while, the first pseudo-Dao appeared.

Su Yu instantly tore through the river, emerging with Lantian to investigate quickly. Soon, Su Yu shook his head and said, "Gone. It should be a Daofuse cultivator, not in the Dao Source Land. There's no connection to their path nearby, but it seems to project towards Chaos Mountain."

This indicated the person had left.

Su Yu continued searching.

...

The second and third were the same.

None of them were here; they had all left.

The fourth and fifth, Su Yu glanced at briefly. The paths were weak, incomplete rules of the Dao. Even if fully refined, they would barely reach Daofuse, not worth much attention. They couldn't possibly become Heavenly King-level experts.

As he walked and observed, Su Yu's eyes flickered. Ahead, a tributary felt quite powerful.

He moved more cautiously, silently tearing through the river with Lantian, emerging into the outside world.

...

It was a stone mountain, its age unknown.

As soon as Su Yu emerged, he looked towards the connection point of the path, frowning slightly. He transmitted, "The person might be here, not dead, but has severed the path connection, possibly in deep slumber!"

He looked at the stone mountain beneath his feet. It seemed ordinary, a common sight in the Dao Source Land. But this place might be the resting place of a powerful being.

"Let's earth-dive and take a look!"

A pseudo-Dao expert who has severed their path connection would need time to awaken. Su Yu wasn't worried at all.

Both could earth-dive, instantly diving into the ground.

As they went deeper, the ground became more solid. Digging here might not yield water; you might dig for years and find a massive rock or even hit a realm barrier, never breaking through!

It was unclear how long they dove, but Su Yu and Lantian concealed all their auras.

In the depths of the earth, a small stone house appeared before them. Inside, a humanoid figure sat cross-legged, seemingly long dead, like a skeleton.

There was no sign of life, only a faint aura of decay lingering in the stone house.

"A stone house made of forbidden stone can eliminate some auras. This is a strong cultivator in a death seclusion!"

Lantian quickly transmitted, while Su Yu also looked at the figure. After a while, he transmitted, "Not a human, seems like a God Race expert... the pseudo-Dao is cultivated to the peak, not too weak. If revived, it might have Heavenly King combat power!"

This was a God Race expert!

It was unknown how long it had been in death seclusion here!

"Should we take action?"

Lantian looked at Su Yu. "You can suppress it with the Starry Sky Seal. The person hasn't connected to their path, hasn't revived. Under suppression, they might only have Eternal combat power, easy to capture!"

Though only possessing Sunmoon power, being a Heavenly King expert, even without connecting to the path, they could still exert Eternal combat power.

"Capture it for what?"

Su Yu chuckled, eyes narrowing. "A pseudo-Dao expert in death seclusion is nothing to me... but to others, it's a genuine Heavenly King!"

"Aren't the three major races sweeping for experts? Fine... I'll add some spice to its path. Once it connects, it'll go berserk. If the Moon Heavenly Sage sweeps to this one, will they kill their own? If not, a berserk Heavenly King... even a Heavenly Sage must be cautious!"

"You're so wicked!"

Lantian's voice suddenly turned soft and seductive, sending shivers down Su Yu's spine. Damn it, don't talk like that!

Ignoring him, Su Yu quietly ascended, releasing a bit of the power of laws into the stone, transmitting, "I'm offering a full service, worried they won't find this one! Leaving some God Race aura, when the Moon Sage sees it, they'll be delighted. Perhaps this is a forgotten expert of their God Race... reviving a Heavenly King, they might burst with joy!"

"Brother Emperor Yu is getting more wicked!"

Lantian again emitted a creepy sweet voice. Su Yu wanted to punch his head off, ignoring him as he quickly ascended.

Lantian followed, transmitting, "What if they suppress this person without killing them?"

Su Yu transmitted back, "Nonsense, don't you think I know? I'll add some spice to their path. If suppressed, they'll self-destruct... let the myriad races go mad!"

"Will it work?"

"Don't ask if it will work. In the Myriad Realms, it won't. Here, it will!"

With the Starry Sky Seal, it's the greatest assurance. The person's path connection is severed. Su Yu can modify their path chaotically, and they won't notice.

In the Myriad Realms, Su Yu couldn't do this; otherwise, he would have long since stolen the power of the Myriad Realms' paths on a large scale.

...

Soon, Su Yu entered the River of Time, using the Starry Sky Seal to suppress and modify the pseudo-Dao.

Madness, chaos, slaughter, frenzy!

Su Yu was adept at all kinds of willpower.

Using them now was second nature!

Spending some resources, he thoroughly modified the pseudo-Dao, leaving Su Yu satisfied, just waiting for the results. Hopefully, those Heavenly Sages would come soon. A berserk Heavenly King, theoretically on the same level, might lead to some interesting events!

...

Su Yu noted the location and continued searching.

Soon, he found a second slumbering Daofuse, but it was just a Daofuse. To Su Yu, it felt like third-rate Daofuse power, very weak... Su Yu didn't even bother to modify it, lest it attract the attention of the myriad races' experts.

There were quite a few pseudo-Dao experts, but most had left.

...

After nearly a day, Su Yu found a second slumbering pseudo-Dao Heavenly King.

This was at the bottom of a deep river.

Both Lantian and Su Yu frowned. At the riverbed, a skeletal humanoid figure lay in the mud, devoid of any aura, as if truly dead!

"Is it human?"

Lantian was unsure. "Feels like a human... but is it dead? There's no aura at all."

The person had been slumbering here for who knows how many years. The original seclusion place might not have had this river. Now, the river had existed for countless ages, possibly washing away the person's cave, leaving the skeletal frame exposed.

Su Yu carefully observed for a moment. The Heaven Gate opened, and after a while, he shook his head. "He's alive, but it feels like he's on the brink of death. If we hadn't come, in a few more years, he might have just quietly passed away. It's hard to say if this guy can even be revived... Did the Human Race practice pseudo-daos back then?"

This guy had been in seclusion for many years, indicating he wasn't from the recent millennia, possibly even from ten thousand years ago. 

Back then, did the Human Race already start practicing pseudo-daos? Truly lacking ambition!

According to Marquis Dingjun and the others, before the Ninth Tide, the Human Race almost never practiced pseudo-daos because cultivating them was quite superficial. Every generation of Human Lords, including the Hundred Battle King, advised against practicing these pseudo-daos.

Lantian chuckled, "Maybe he's close to dying and is seeking a chance to save his life... What should we do with him? Should we just blow him up?"

"You're truly ruthless!" Su Yu sneered. "He's still part of the Human Race!"

"What if he's an enemy?"

"Then blow him up!"

Su Yu continued, transmitting his voice with a smile, "Not all ancient relics are enemies. Even a pseudo-dao Heavenly King is still a Heavenly King... Let's assess the situation first. I'll suppress him, and you capture him. Try not to make too much noise!"

"Alright!"

The two divided their tasks clearly. Su Yu used the Starry Sky Seal to suppress, instantly severing the faint connection to the Great Dao.

At this moment, the skeletal remains deep at the riverbed trembled slightly. It seemed to want to awaken, but before it could, Lantian covered it with a large net, capturing it and storing it within. Lantian grinned, "This is the first time I've caught such a weak Heavenly King. It feels weaker than even an Eternal!"

He had never seen such a weak Heavenly King-level expert!

The skeletal remains, now ensnared, struggled to open its eyes. After a long while, it barely managed to open them, revealing confusion and a hint of death—a sign of being in seclusion for too long, on the verge of death.

After several seconds of bewilderment, the skeletal remains finally spoke in a hoarse voice, "Who... are you?"

It seemed to recognize Su Yu as part of the Human Race, its voice rasping, "Human Lord... is it still Yue Gang?"

Yue Gang?

Su Yu quickly thought, vaguely recalling that Yue Gang was a Human Lord from the Third Tide? Probably!

That meant it had been at least seventy thousand years!

He still thought the Human Lord was Yue Gang!

"Yue Gang has been dead for tens of thousands of years..."

The skeletal remains showed a trace of bewilderment in its eyes. Dead for tens of thousands of years?

What year is it now?

"Then... what about Minshan... Minshan?"

"Just died recently."

"Dead?"

The skeletal remains were stunned. "Then... what about Bingku?"

"Dead!"

"What about Marquis Tianyang?"

"Dead!"

"What about Danyu?"

"Dead."

"What about Marquis Dingbei?"

"Dead!"

"What about Marquis Yuyang?"

"Dead!"

"..."

The skeletal remains were utterly devastated, its eyes filled with despair. "All dead?"

Upon opening its eyes again, the world had changed!

Everyone it knew was dead!

Why had it come to this?

At this moment, the skeletal remains' voice was hoarse to the extreme. "Is there... no one alive?"

Su Yu thought for a moment. You didn't ask about anyone who's alive!

"Marquis Dingjun is still alive..."

"Impossible!"

The skeletal remains were shocked. "That useless one, so weak, how could he survive when the strong ones fell?"

"..."

Su Yu felt that it was a huge loss that Marquis Dingjun wasn't here right now!

Listen to this!

If I were Marquis Dingjun, I'd strangle this skeletal remains right now. Look at the state you're in, and you're still looking down on others!

However, the ancient marquises mentioned by this skeletal remains were indeed very powerful.

It was indeed unbelievable that these people were dead while Dingjun was alive.

Su Yu casually said, "No choice, a few years ago, a powerful Human Lord, quite useless, led over a hundred Daofuse experts to fight the myriad races and was wiped out by them."

"Powerful... useless? Wiped out?"

The skeletal remains trembled.

Su Yu nodded. "Yes, very strong, but very useless. They were wiped out by the myriad races in one fell swoop. Those you knew were all wiped out in that incident!"

"Who was this person?"

"Hundred Battle King!"

"Useless... cough cough..."

The skeletal remains coughed, even coughing up black blood.

Incredible!

Our Human Race's strong ones were wiped out in one fell swoop?

"Hundred Battle..."

The skeletal remains murmured, with some resentment, "How could this be... Then who are you?"

Su Yu smiled, "New generation of the Human Race! Alright, you're about to die, say less! After searching for so long, we found a pseudo-dao Human Race expert, and we don't even know if he can be revived... Feels like a loss. Lantian, let's go, don't kill him, just infuse some source qi to keep him alive!"

"Alright!"

Lantian chuckled, infusing some source qi.

Su Yu erased all traces left at the scene and quickly left with the skeletal remains.

As for whether the skeletal remains could be revived, who cared.

If not, so be it. If not, it seemed he wouldn't live long anyway.

Just a skeletal remains, penniless, practicing pseudo-dao, Su Yu wasn't very interested, not even a bit of foundation.

Su Yu didn't care about him, took the skeletal remains, and continued exploring the River of Time.

First, he would investigate the pseudo-dao experts thoroughly.

After spending another full day, Su Yu discovered another pseudo-dao expert. This place was already near the end of the river at Tianhekou, indicating this might be the last expert.

This expert was neither Human Race nor from the three major strong races. Upon closer inspection, Su Yu thought it might be a large bird, but probably not a phoenix, likely one of the extinct species.

This one also had Heavenly King-level combat power. Su Yu was not polite at all, following the same procedure as with the first Heavenly King expert, adding some material to the opponent's Great Dao.

As for who would be unlucky, it depended on luck.

Upon investigation, there were only three pseudo-dao Heavenly Kings, referring to those in slumber, five second-class Daofuse, and Su Yu was too lazy to look at the others.

The remaining pseudo-dao Heavenly Kings had probably left. Su Yu couldn't determine exactly how many, probably five or six.

Including the six he killed last time, it added up to fifteen or sixteen pseudo-dao Heavenly Kings born over the years, which was actually quite a few.

At this moment, it was also the third day.

Su Yu had just made some adjustments to the third Heavenly King when he sensed a series of powerful auras approaching.

The six Heavenly Sovereigns had arrived!

Su Yu didn't even have time to investigate those true dao experts.

Clearly, Ren Mountain had been moved, and these guys were coming to sweep the Source of the Dao.
