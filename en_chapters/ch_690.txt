Chapter 690: The Land of the Abyss

Su Yu left the grand hall, traversing through the void, heading straight for the Death Realm. This time, he had a significant task to accomplish: positioning and locking down the locations of various realms to prepare for a capture. 

This time, as long as he could take down the Daofuse experts outside the God, Demon, and Immortal races, only six Daofuse experts from those three races would remain, along with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao who were not in the small realms. Thus, the myriad races would only have eight Daofuse experts left in the lower realm.

"If I openly go to capture the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao, Tiangu and the others might not intervene," Su Yu mused as he walked through the void.

The Heavenly Overseer Marquis was associated with the paper dao, while Liu Hong was linked to the ink dao. This time, when visiting the Death Realm, he also needed to bring Liu Hong out. That guy had merged with the dao and was incredibly fast. Regardless, it was worth pulling him out for use.

...

In the Death Realm, Su Yu first arrived at the Ancient Castle of Star and Moon. He was curious about the origin of a particular stone and wanted to inquire with Star and Moon.

Inside the castle, Star and Moon frowned upon seeing Su Yu. "Why are you here again?"

"You came quite quickly!" she remarked.

Su Yu chuckled, "I helped you conquer the Myriad Realms, took down a few Daofuse experts, and came to report my progress."

Star and Moon ignored his nonsense. Conquered the Myriad Realms? That had nothing to do with her.

She continued tending to her black flowers and plants, asking, "Where are the flowers you promised to bring me?"

With a wave of his hand, Su Yu produced countless flowers and trees, though they began to wither. Golden light shimmered from his body, the power of fortune erupting, protecting the plants from the corrosion of death energy.

Su Yu smiled, "I collected many for you."

Star and Moon glanced over, initially delighted, but quickly suppressed her joy. "I wanted the flowers you showed me last time. Why aren't they here?"

Su Yu explained, "Those flowers were cultivated by the Fat Ball for over a hundred thousand years. Picking one made the Fat Ball cry terribly. I couldn't bear it, so I brought you a different variety. They're actually more beautiful than the ones from the Culture King's side!"

Star and Moon snorted but didn't press further. She approached the colorful flowers, a hint of joy in her eyes, and squatted down to admire them. "These won't last long, will they?"

"Don't worry. A bit of fortune power can sustain them. As long as I live, the fortune endures, and so will these plants."

"Alright."

Star and Moon responded perfunctorily, engrossed in arranging her castle. The dark castle now had a touch of vitality.

Seeing her in a good mood, Su Yu followed her, smiling, "I visited the Culture King's Residence as you suggested and dug up the treasure you buried there. But... I don't quite understand what it is."

Su Yu took out a box and opened it, revealing a stone inside. Despite the corrosion of death energy, the stone remained unchanged.

Star and Moon glanced at it, a hint of hesitation in her eyes. After a while, she said, "I don't remember what it is. It's been too long. Maybe it's something I took from home? I think I buried it at the Culture King's place to hide it from my family."

Su Yu pondered, family...

After a while, he asked, "Does Star and Moon know the Human Emperor?"

"Don't remember."

Star and Moon replied calmly, "These people are too powerful. They interfere with the past and future, disrupting the memories of the dead. Even if you ask Marquis Lanshan, she won't remember what the Culture King looked like."

Su Yu was taken aback.

Star and Moon continued indifferently, "She remembers the Culture King, but if you ask her what he looked like, she definitely won't know! These powerful beings can only be recalled if we are strong enough!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded.

"Do you know the use of this stone?"

"No idea."

Star and Moon replied, continuing to fiddle with her plants. Seeing Su Yu still lingering, she felt a bit embarrassed. After all, he had brought her many plants. She thought for a moment but still couldn't recall much. Some fragments flashed through her mind, and after a while, she said, "It might... have the effect of stabilizing rules?"

Su Yu was startled. "What?"

Star and Moon explained, "I don't remember the specifics, but it seems... someone mentioned that this item can stabilize mountains and rivers, solidifying everything! I buried it at the Culture King's Residence, possibly deceived by the Time Sage, to help stabilize her residence."

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "You mean this stone can stabilize the River of Time?"

"Possibly."

Su Yu's heart trembled. Stabilize the River of Time!

What is the most powerful thing in this world?

In Su Yu's view, it wasn't the master of rules or the Celestial River of Death, but the River of Time!

Could this stone stabilize the River of Time?

Don't joke!

What is the River of Time?

It's the source of the great dao!

Whether it's opening a dao or merging with a dao, the river will ripple. If the power of laws can be suppressed, doesn't that mean... it would be easier for him to merge with the dao?

Thoughts flashed through his mind.

Moreover, Su Yu had some ideas. Recently, he had people collect more blood essence and corpses, and even the Heaven Forging King was helping him craft items for the Mark of Civilization.

Su Yu wanted to learn from the Time Sage and walk the path of unifying myriad daos.

However, Su Yu was worried that the power of the great dao was too vast, and the myriad daos too strong, which might overwhelm the Mark of Civilization.

The Book of Time wasn't overwhelmed because it was of a high level, and crucially, it had been suppressed by a powerful being. Also, the Time Sage hadn't collected enough strong daos!

Could this stone suppress the violent daos?

Thoughts continued to rise.

Perhaps he could give it a try!

Currently, he had considerable strength under his command, even at the Heavenly King level. The Old Turtle was recently comprehending the great dao and might step into the Heavenly King level soon. As for the Great Qin King and Great Xia King, Su Yu felt it was only a matter of time.

The Great Zhou King... was hard to say, as he was already extremely strong.

Wan Tiansheng might even surpass him soon!

Although Su Yu was the core of the alliance, if he wasn't strong enough, it would lead to a situation where the ruler was weak and the ministers strong, which wasn't good.

Moreover, the Martial Emperor and Hundred Battle King were about to revive, which was also troublesome.

Currently, Su Yu wanted to quickly enhance his strength, and this stone might help him.

With these thoughts, Su Yu quickly said, "I'll try it later. Do you have any other treasures in the Myriad Realms?"

"…"

Star and Moon glanced at him. "What do you think?"

This guy, always thinking about treasures, how vulgar!

Su Yu laughed, not minding.

If there aren't any, then there aren't any.

Soon, Su Yu checked the time and said, "Enjoy yourself, I have things to do and need to get busy."

"Go ahead!"

Star and Moon said casually, "Next time you come, bring some food from the living realm and see if it can be preserved."

"Alright!"

Su Yu agreed and quickly left.

After he left, Star and Moon finally revealed a bright smile, looking at the flowers and plants before her, feeling they were incredibly beautiful. The flowers and plants from the living realm were indeed more pleasing. At this moment, she even felt a desire to revive.

Previously, she hadn't felt this strongly.

...

Su Yu didn't linger, quickly beginning to sense the locations of the Human Lord Seals in various human prefectures.

The Human Lord Seal was with Marquis Lanshan, but Su Yu could also use the power of fortune to sense it, though it was faint.

After all, it was separated by the boundary of life and death. Although the power of fortune could penetrate somewhat, it was still difficult to lock onto it.

Until Marquis Lanshan returned and Su Yu obtained the Human Lord Seal, the sensing became clearer.

...

Four Kings' Domains, West King Domain.

After the West King was killed, the West King Domain was quickly taken over by Marquis Lanshan and the others. At this moment, on a pitch-black mountain in the West King Domain, Su Yu's Human Lord Seal emitted a faint glow.

Very faint!

And on the Human Lord Seal, the map belonging to the Great Xia Prefecture flickered slightly.

Behind Su Yu, Hetu and the others were extremely tense.

Su Yu, however, remained calm, sensing for a moment before exhaling, "The Great Xia Seal! It's here. Above this place should be where the Great Xia Seal is buried, in the Ape Realm! This place, above it, is the Ape Realm!"

He smiled, the first one was positioned!

The Ape Emperor!

Su Yu quickly said, "Send someone to station here, dispatch a necromancer marquis and ten monarchs to seal this place!"

With that, Su Yu left a golden mark in the void.

Locked!

Great, the Ape Emperor has lived long enough. It's time to send him on his way, though not now.

First, let's lock down the other realms.

Marquis Lanshan quickly began issuing orders to seal the area, all quite excited. It was indeed possible to lock onto the living realms from the Death Realm.

...

Su Yu led his people, sensing everywhere.

The second place locked was the Phoenix Realm.

Corresponding to the Great Ming Seal.

Su Yu quickly left a mark and arranged for people to station below.

The Phoenix Realm was also within the Four Kings' Domains.

The third place was the Kunpeng Realm, which was somewhat close to the Celestial River of Death.

Su Yu continued to follow the pattern, positioning and locking it.

So far, aside from the God, Demon, and Immortal realms, and the Dragon Realm, all other races with Daofuse experts had been locked.

Su Yu, leading his people, flew around the Four Kings' Domains for half a day but couldn't sense anything, causing him to frown.

At this moment, everyone looked beyond the Four Kings' Domains.

Then, the South King arrived, saying solemnly, "The Dragon Realm... its corresponding location might be in the Land of the Abyss!"

Not in the Four Kings' Domains.

Then it's highly likely to correspond to the Land of the Abyss!

The South King said gravely, "Powerful realms might not correspond to places within the Four Kings' Domains! Including the Human Realm! The Human Realm... the place it corresponds to might be more dangerous, perhaps even a place of suppression!"

She turned to Su Yu and said, "Back then, the Human Race must have suppressed a group of powerful undead. I don't know the specifics, but I do know that since the Human Race suppressed them, they wouldn't always enter and exit through the passage here. If the suppressed powerhouses rebelled, the first response would be to directly mobilize powerhouses from the Human Realm to rush to the place of suppression!"

Su Yu's heart stirred. "South King, are you suggesting that beneath the Human Realm lies the place where the Martial King and others suppressed these powerhouses?"

"Very likely!" The South King nodded. "The Human Race was strong back then. If you were the one suppressing them, where would you choose to do it?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. "Indeed, suppressing them right under my own nose would be best. If they dared to stir, I could kill them at any time! So, it's fortunate I didn't recklessly open the Human Realm passage earlier. Otherwise, I might have opened a suppression site, and there could be Heavenly Kings or even rulers of laws suppressed below."

Were there rulers of laws among the undead suppressed back then? It was hard to say. The path of the undead was powerful; even the path of the physical body could birth powerhouses comparable to rulers of laws. Why couldn't the path of the undead do the same? Perhaps there really were such beings!

If that were the case, it would be best not to open the undead passage in the Human Realm. Otherwise, it could lead to great trouble, with peerless powerhouses breaking free and invading. That would be a real problem.

Su Yu looked towards the pitch-black Land of the Abyss and exhaled lightly. "The North King and the others have already gone in without any issues. Let's venture in a bit and see if we can locate the Dragon Realm! The Heavenly Dragon Marquis of the Dragon Realm is not weak. Capturing him in his own realm would be ideal!"

Locking down the Dragon Realm would align with Su Yu's intentions. Four Daofuse cultivators!

The South King spoke solemnly, "We can only explore the periphery. Do not go deep. Even the North King didn't dare to venture deep, only staying at the edge of the Land of the Abyss. Furthermore, the Land of the Abyss is not under the rule of the Human Realm's laws!"

"What difference does that make?" Su Yu asked. The South King explained, "First, there is no suppression. Even the Four Kings Seals are ineffective, and your Human Lord Seal should also be useless! Second, because there is no power of the Human Realm's laws, the Land of the Abyss is dominated by the rules of the undead! In other words, the undead are stronger here! All other paths will be somewhat suppressed!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. The South King continued, "Third, because the path of the undead is suppressed in the Four Kings' Domains, the feeling is not obvious. But in the Land of the Abyss, you will feel it very clearly. Living beings here are invaded by the path at an extremely fast rate. Be careful not to be invaded by the path!"

Su Yu nodded again, but quickly added, "It shouldn't affect me too much. I am somewhat connected to the path of the undead, being half-undead myself."

"True." The South King nodded, saying no more. As long as Su Yu was cautious, the periphery, though dangerous, was not beyond the reach of even a Heavenly King. The North King had brought people here, so Su Yu and his group should not face too many issues.

Without further hesitation, Su Yu and his group swiftly stepped into the Land of the Abyss.

Upon entering, Su Yu felt it distinctly. It was dark! Utterly dark. In the Death Realm, though dim, the Four Kings' Domains were like dusk. Here, it was true night.

Su Yu could clearly sense that the death aura here was denser and more corrosive. The darkness had little effect on Su Yu and his group, and none on the undead. Su Yu wasn't concerned as he looked around. There were very few undead here, almost none.

However, this place felt quite dangerous.

Su Yu furrowed his brows slightly and said in a deep voice, "Let's circle around first, check the periphery, and see if we can find the Dragon Realm. Hopefully, it's only on the periphery. If it's in the inner area or near a sealed place, that would be troublesome!"

The group nodded, saying nothing, while Su Yu quickly began to sense and explore.

In fact, he vaguely sensed some human aura deep within. It might be the residual aura from the seals left in the Human Realm. This suggested that the corresponding location in the Human Realm might indeed be deep within. Su Yu had no desire to go there, lest he accidentally release those sealed beings.

...

Halfway through their exploration, Su Yu spotted a stone house. Yes, a house built from pitch-black stones in this desolate place.

Su Yu frowned slightly. The next moment, as if sensing something, he shouted, "Teacher Liu, come out!"

From within the stone house, the stone door gradually opened.

After a while, Xia Chen cautiously emerged. Seeing Su Yu and the others, he relaxed slightly. Xia Chen had evidently advanced, now exuding a Daofuse aura.

Seeing familiar faces, Xia Chen was less tense. He quickly spoke, "Liu Hong left not long ago. It's just me here."

"Hmm?" Su Yu was surprised. Liu Hong had left?

"Where did he go?"

"He might have gone to the Celestial River of Death."

Xia Chen approached, looking at the group. When he saw the South King, he tensed slightly but quickly composed himself. "Liu Hong inherited the Culture King's path, but having just fused with it, he needs more resources to advance. He likely went to the Celestial River of Death."

Nearby, Hetu frowned. "Why did you let him go?"

Xia Chen was puzzled. "He... he is the Culture King's inheritor..."

The South King looked at Su Yu, who calmly said, "The four paths of pen, ink, paper, and inkstone. Liu Hong inherited the ink path, making him the Culture King's inheritor."

Hearing this, the South King said nothing more, merely casting a curious glance at the small house ahead, frowning slightly. "This house seems to have been left by the Culture King, but I've been here several times and never found it. How did it suddenly appear?"

Xia Chen explained, "This house was originally hidden and required the Culture King's token to open. I helped Liu Hong open it. Inside were some cultivation resources and some of the Culture King's manuscripts, all taken by Liu Hong. Now, this house still has some function, accelerating the cultivation of the undead path, so I've stayed here."

In other words, the benefits had been reaped, and there were no more left.

Su Yu frowned slightly, turning to Marquis Lanshan. "Send someone to find Liu Hong. Tell him to stop hiding from me. I'm not interested in killing him to seize the ink path! That coward is just afraid I'll kill him, so he's deliberately avoiding me!"

Marquis Lanshan quickly nodded. Xia Chen, however, offered an explanation, "He does need to strengthen the ink path, and the Celestial River of Death..."

Su Yu waved his hand. "Senior Xia Chen doesn't understand. That coward is just like that, timid as a mouse, afraid I'll do something to him! Little does he know, I'm not interested at all. If I were interested in the ink path, I would have killed him long ago! Of the four paths of pen, ink, paper, and inkstone, besides the pen path, I've also obtained the inkstone path, and I gave it away! In the future, if someone steps onto the pen path, I'll make way for them too. Cultivation is ultimately one's own business. Transcending predecessors is the true pursuit!"

He spoke plainly, but the South King and others listened with some admiration. Su Yu wasn't even interested in the Culture King's path.

The South King had previously thought that since Liu Hong was the Culture King's inheritor, Su Yu might be too unkind. But now, even without having met Liu Hong, the South King felt there was no comparison between the two.

One dominated the Myriad Realms, with strategies beyond measure. The other hid and cowered, afraid of what Su Yu might do to him. Such a person was merely lucky to have stumbled upon the Culture King's legacy. How could he compare to Su Yu?

As for abandoning the Culture King's path to walk his own, the South King didn't see anything wrong with that. In fact, it was what the Culture King would have wanted to see.

Blindly inheriting the Culture King's path would mean never stepping out of his shadow.

A ruler like Su Yu naturally had his own path to walk.

Xia Chen said nothing more, glancing at the group before speaking, "This place is suitable for some undead lords to cultivate, making it easier to step into Daofuse! I've already advanced to Daofuse, and my realm is stable. This place, with its important resources taken, can be used by some lords for cultivation..."

"How bold!" Marquis Lanshan interrupted him, scolding, "How dare you, Xia Chen! His Majesty has now ascended as the Lord of the Myriad Realms, and you dare address him by name?"

Xia Chen was stunned. Su Yu waved his hand. "Lanshan, enough. Don't talk about this! Xia Chen is a senior of my lineage and a propagator of the Culture King's pen path. Without Senior Xia Chen bringing out the Culture Tomb, I wouldn't have been able to walk the pen path."

Su Yu said a few words, glanced at the stone house, and after a brief inspection, said, "Arrange for someone to station here. If Senior Xia Chen has no other matters, join us. If you have things to do, feel free to go about them!"

Xia Chen, still unaware of the situation, looked at Hetu and, after some thought, said, "I'll... I'll go with you."

Still puzzled.

Lord of the Myriad Realms? What major event had occurred during his brief seclusion?

He thought to ask Hetu later, as he was utterly confused and had no idea what had happened.

Su Yu said no more, continuing to search the periphery to locate the Dragon Realm. Only then would this mission be complete.

...

At the same time Su Yu was locating the Dragon Realm, deep within the Land of the Abyss.

At the end of the Death Realm.

At this moment, in the dark sky, over a dozen black beams of light pierced through the heavens and earth. Some beams were strong, others weak. Some were immensely thick, while others were frail.

At this time, the North King, accompanied by some others, looked at these beams with a heavy expression.

"The place of sealing!"

The North King stood at the periphery. Beyond the dozen beams was a series of barriers, like water ripples, blocking their path.

Vaguely, countless chains and characters appeared.

At this moment, as the North King approached, some of the black beams fluctuated. After a moment, a withered face appeared on one of the medium beams, looking at the North King with cold eyes.

After watching for a while, it suddenly sneered, "Lapdog! It's you, Ming Douhe!"

The North King looked at the other with a grave expression, slowly saying, "Dizhi Luo! You're still alive. I thought you were dead!"

"Dead?" The withered face was filled with mockery and disdain. "I've already died once. What fear do I have of death? But you, you seem like a stray dog! Did you come here because you were driven away?"

The North King frowned. "You... are all still alive?"

"Heh!"

The sallow-faced figure sneered, "Taishan and the others don't dare to kill us! And even if they did, what then? It won't sever the path of the dead. Killing us will only give rise to more powerful beings. All they can do is seal us!"

The sealed undead were all defiant, unwilling to submit. Yet, they were also difficult to kill. Slaughtering them all would only result in the birth of more powerful entities. Unless the path of the undead was completely severed, the birth of supreme beings in the Death Realm could not be stopped.

At this moment, the North King’s eyes flickered. He ignored Dizhi Luo, whose strength was comparable to his own and who had been sealed for many years. Instead, he looked towards the deepest part of the area, where a stronger black pillar of light stood.

How many powerful beings were sealed here? Over the years, he had sent people to explore the Land of the Abyss, but none had returned. It seemed these people couldn't leave the sealed area. How did they die?

As he pondered, his heart stirred, and he suddenly threw a punch!

Boom!

A shadow appeared in the void, knocked back by his punch. The shadow flew backward, crashing into a barrier and spitting out a mouthful of black blood.

The shadow quickly vanished. Just as the North King was about to pursue, Dizhi Luo’s cold voice came from within the barrier, "Ming Douhe, do you wish to become our enemy?"

The North King replied gravely, "You still control some of the undead?"

The undead just now was not weak, stronger than an ordinary undead marquis, yet bold enough to attack him.

Inside the barrier, Dizhi Luo sneered, "We are, after all, the masters of this Death Realm. Do you dogs think you can control the entire Death Realm?"

He continued coldly, "A few days ago, quite a few of your kind died, didn't they? Just like you, mere dogs."

With a mocking tone, he added, "The ancient times have perished, and you dogs are facing retribution! How laughable!"

The North King spoke solemnly, "It seems your information is not outdated. Are you planning to unseal yourselves?"

"What do you think?" Dizhi Luo smiled coldly, looking up at the sky, "It's only a matter of time!"

Then, he turned his gaze back to the North King, "Dog, will you join us?"

The North King frowned, "Besides you, who else is alive?"

At this moment, only this guy had shown himself among the pillars of light. The North King looked deeper, wanting to know who else was alive and how strong they were.

Dizhi Luo laughed coldly, "More than you think! The Death Emperor is still alive. The Death Realm will eventually be ours again!"

The North King’s heart trembled!

The Death Emperor!

This... this was an extremely formidable undead from the past. When the Martial King and others waged war on the Death Realm, they encountered resistance only once, and that was from the Death Emperor.

This being wasn’t dead, merely sealed?

Dizhi Luo continued coldly, "Ming Douhe, no need to look further! What about Ziyan? Is that woman dead or alive?"

"The West King's Consort?"

"Perhaps," Dizhi Luo replied.

The North King’s mind raced. The West King's Consort was colluding with these guys. He said solemnly, "The West King's Consort seems to have been captured, or perhaps she's dead."

He glanced at the barrier again, recalling the undead that had attacked earlier, and suddenly said, "Was it her doing? Did she create a small breach in this seal?"

The West King's Consort was also skilled in sealing. Over the years, she might have done some work in this sealed area, creating a breach that allowed these guys to contact the outside and control some undead. Otherwise, the North King believed that the Martial King and others wouldn’t have had their seals broken so easily.

"Ha, you’re quite clever!" Dizhi Luo laughed coldly, "That woman promised to continue helping us unseal, yet she’s disappeared. Foolish woman! I told her long ago, just release us, and all troubles could be resolved, but she refused to believe, insisting on delaying!"

The North King felt heavy-hearted. The West King's Consort... unsealing...

He roughly guessed the process. The West King's Consort had likely visited this place many times over the years, but probably hadn’t fully committed to helping these people unseal, merely giving them a bit of hope and establishing some rapport. Unsealing them would risk backlash.

Dizhi Luo didn’t continue discussing the West King's Consort. Whether she was dead or captured, it didn’t matter. He smiled faintly, "Ming Douhe, you seem to have lost and fled here. It looks like you couldn’t contend with the Human Race! How about helping us unseal? Once we’re out, you can still be the North King..."

"Me?"

As the North King pondered, a faint voice echoed in his mind, "Kill all those undead marquises under your command! We can absorb more power of the laws. Ming Douhe, what use is there in keeping those wastes? Kill them, and we can, as in the past, drive out those outsiders and continue being the overlords of the undead! We might even take the opportunity to invade the Living Realm!"

Yes, with the death of an undead marquis, they could absorb more power of the laws. Currently, Dizhi Luo could manifest his will smoothly, partly due to the recent deaths of many powerful beings. The more that died, the more power they could absorb.

The North King’s heart trembled slightly.

Kill the undead marquises to free these guys?

This tide, indeed, everything was happening. One by one, ancient sealed powerhouses were emerging.

The North King glanced at the sealed interior. Besides Dizhi Luo, the others seemed to be absorbing the power of the laws, not paying attention to him. He quickly said, "I’ll consider it!"

With that, he swiftly retreated from the area.

This place was not safe to linger. These guys might not have any goodwill towards him, and he had to be careful not to be trapped by them.

He quickly left with a group of undead marquises.

After they left, at the far end of the sealed area, a human face appeared on a black pillar of light, looking almost like a normal human. The face watched the direction in which the North King and his group departed, then turned towards a certain location—where Su Yu and his group were.

A faint smile appeared on the face, "The Human Race’s foundation is completely exhausted. In this era, everything that should emerge will emerge! Everything will start anew!"

"Dizhi Luo, don’t be too hasty! The grudge against the Human Race for suppressing us will be avenged sooner or later!"

"Emperor, I know."

Dizhi Luo laughed, "I was just teasing Ming Douhe. This dog, now chased around by his master, how pathetic! Once the seal is lifted, with the Emperor’s power, we will unify the Myriad Realms!"

The face at the back, with a hint of nostalgia, spoke softly, "No, that’s meaningless. Controlling the Death Realm is enough. The Living Realm isn’t that simple. What we need to do is expel all outsiders, seal the Spirit Suppression Domain, let the dead return to the dead, and the living to the living."

"At least we should destroy the Human Race, for revenge!"

Dizhi Luo said venomously, "Even if Taishan and the others are dead, we must annihilate their descendants!"

The Death Emperor said nothing, and the face soon disappeared.

...

At the same time.

Luminous Domain Mansion.

The Martial Emperor opened his eyes, slightly puzzled. Soon, he thought of something and sneered, "Taishan, it seems the troubles you left behind are all surfacing!"

It seemed the Death Realm, with some sealed pests, was about to break free!

Indeed, this tide was the final chaotic era!

The power of laws and sealing power that had been maintained for a hundred thousand years were all dissipating!

This time, once the Upper Realm opens, the Allheaven Battlefield might never close again!

All those powers of laws are about to be exhausted!

Su Yu, being complacent now is useless.

What he will face will be more difficult than the previous tides.

Because, whether it’s him, the Martial Emperor, or the pests in the Death Realm, or any sealed beings in the Upper Realm, they will all revive in this tide!

All the backhands, flaws, and leftover issues left by the Martial King and others will be revealed in this tide.

More difficult than the Ninth Tide!

The Martial Emperor sneered. That guy was arrogant, but once the power of the laws of the heavens dissipates, he’ll know what despair is.

Even if I don’t deal with Su Yu, he’ll find it hard to escape death.

"No matter how brilliant you are, this era will not belong to you!"

The Martial Emperor sighed lightly, suddenly losing some of his schadenfreude. It was boring. That little bug Su Yu couldn’t withstand all this.

...

At this moment.

Su Yu didn’t care about these matters. At this moment, a flash of joy appeared in his eyes. He had located the Dragon Realm!

Fortunately, it was on the periphery.

At this moment, his "Calamity" character was pulsating, and Su Yu roughly guessed what it meant. It was merely a crisis, either from the depths of the Death Realm, the Martial Emperor, the Hundred Battle King, or the Upper Realm.

It wasn’t too intense, meaning it wasn’t time yet.

Probably someone was thinking about him just now!

He was prepared for such a crisis.

"The four great realms have all been located!"

Su Yu exhaled, extremely pleased. As for the crisis, to hell with it, there was still time.

Su Yu quickly said, "Prepare to besiege the four great realms’ Daofuse! Summon all undead marquises here, and also have the guardians notify the Great Zhou King to enter the Death Realm!"

He was preparing to clear out the Daofuse of the four great realms.

Things would proceed step by step. After dealing with the Daofuse of the four great realms, he would then handle Duobao and the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, leaving only the Daofuse of the three great realms for now to avoid causing chaos!

Then, he would find a way to explore the Upper Realm. Su Yu’s goals were clear; he didn’t want the Upper Realm to open just yet.

Additionally, collecting 99 councilor orders needed to be prioritized.

If he could use the power of laws to suppress things, that would be best. If not, he would simply integrate them into his Mark of Civilization. He needed to find a way to open the myriad paths.

Soon, Marquis Lanshan and others began issuing orders.

The task of clearing out the four great realms was about to begin.
