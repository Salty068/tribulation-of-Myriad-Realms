**Chapter 690: Land of Return to Ruin**

Su Yu left the main hall, traversing the void, and headed straight for the Death Realm.

This time, a major task needed to be accomplished.

Location!

Pinpointing the locations of the various major and minor realms, and preparing for their capture.

This time, as long as he captured the Daofuse experts outside of the Divine, Devil, and Immortal Races, then with the remaining six Daofuse experts from the Divine, Devil, and Immortal Races, plus Jiantian Hou and Duobao who were not in minor realms, the myriad races in the Lower Realm would only have eight Daofuse experts left.

"Jiantian Hou and Duobao don't enter minor realms. If I openly go to capture and kill them, Tiangu and the others might not even bother to interfere."

Su Yu pondered as he walked through the void.

Jiantian Hou, Paper Dao.

Liu Hong, Ink Dao.

This trip to the Death Realm, he also had to pull that fellow Liu Hong out. That guy had fused with a Dao, and his speed was astonishing. Regardless, he had to be brought out and used first.

...

Death Realm.

Su Yu's first destination was Xingyue's ancient castle.

He was somewhat curious about the origin of that stone and wanted to ask Xingyue about it first.

Inside the ancient castle.

Xingyue saw Su Yu and frowned. "Why are you here again?"

He came really fast!
