Chapter 692: Pacifying the Phoenix Realm

"Ugh!"

Emerging from the Celestial River of Death, Su Yu spat out a mouthful of black blood. Marquis Lanshan and the others were startled by his severe injuries, their faces filled with concern. Though relieved that Su Yu had returned, their worry was still evident.

Yet, Su Yu managed a smile. This journey had not been in vain. He knew he hadn't ventured far enough, missing some crucial insights. For instance, where was the source of the Great Dao? Where did it end? These questions remained unanswered, but they no longer mattered. What mattered was that he seemed to have found a method to nurture his strongest Dao—by siphoning power!

"The Time Sage provided me with a method. The Culture King offered a perspective. This brother and sister duo are truly extraordinary!"

Even though most people mentioned the Culture King more than the Time Sage, Su Yu believed the Time Sage was the truly remarkable one. Her Book of Time had repeatedly brought him immense gains. Her approach to cultivation, her philosophy of reopening the Myriad Realms, creating an independent path, and the illusory Great Dao... Su Yu found it hard to imagine someone so astonishing.

It was just a book! He hadn't even seen her in person, only her silhouette, crying like a child. At that time, Su Yu thought the Time Sage was still a bit immature. Now, he realized he had underestimated her. She was truly extraordinary! The concept behind the Book of Time was flawless!

The only regret was the era. Back then, there were too many powerful beings. The Time Sage couldn't act as freely as Su Yu could now. Otherwise, Su Yu believed her achievements would have been incredibly brilliant!

"Your Majesty!" Marquis Lanshan spoke with concern. Su Yu waved his hand, still coughing up black blood, but he smiled and said, "I'm fine, I'm doing well!"

Then, he turned his head and was surprised, "Great Zhou King?"

The Great Zhou King replied softly, "Emperor Yu, I have been here for three days."

Three days? Su Yu was taken aback, feeling a bit helpless. Time flowed differently in the River of Time. He thought he had merely tangled with a marquis's Dao for a short while, yet three or four days had passed.

The Great Zhou King had arrived, which took time. At this moment, not only the Great Zhou King but many powerful beings had gathered here.

There were ten necromancer marquises under the South King, three under Marquis Lanshan, and two more who had recently joined the Daofuse Realm. Along with Hetu and Xia Chen, there were eight in total here.

Nineteen necromancers, plus the Great Zhou King and Su Yu, made for a total of twenty-one top-tier experts. Outside, there were also dozens of necromancer lords.

Seeing Su Yu emerge, the Great Zhou King relaxed slightly but didn't inquire about the details. He simply asked, "Emperor Yu, are we launching a surprise attack on the Four Realms now? Or should we wait for you to heal and gather more intelligence from the outside? Old Zhu might be about to enter the Daofuse Realm. Once he does, he can coordinate with us to prevent any leaks."

"The Great Ming King is about to enter the Daofuse Realm?" Su Yu chuckled, "It seems the one from the Control King's family did some good after all. I haven't delved much into formations, but if the Great Ming King can step into the Daofuse Realm, that's a good thing. Our Human Race will have another Daofuse expert!"

Back then, the Great Ming, Great Xia, Great Zhou, and Great Qin Kings were all top-tier existences. Now, three of them had entered the Daofuse Realm, and Wan Tiansheng had risen to prominence. If the Great Ming King didn't enter the Daofuse Realm soon, he might die of frustration.

The Great Zhou King laughed, "It's a good thing. That's why I suggest you heal for a couple of days. Once Old Zhu enters the Daofuse Realm, we can prepare. We won't lose anything by waiting a day or two."

Su Yu nodded. Indeed, a day or two wouldn't make a difference. Moreover, he could take this opportunity to observe whether the chicken he borrowed could bring him any surprises.

Necromancers inherently had flaws. Now, he had implanted a bewitching illusory Dao into the marquis's Dao. If the marquis's will weakened slightly, he might succumb to the temptation and start killing, even directly engaging in slaughter!

Thinking of this, Su Yu suddenly looked at the Great Zhou King and asked, "The Myriad Races haven't produced a single master of laws in ten thousand years?"

"No," the Great Zhou King replied. "Truly none. Otherwise, whether it's the Human Race or the Myriad Races, if there were a master of laws, the battles would have been resolved long ago! Over the years, the closest to this power was the Hundred Battle King, in terms of strength, not realm!"

"Not a single one in ten thousand years, yet over 140 appeared before that!" Su Yu muttered. Were the people from ten thousand years ago countless times more talented than those of the past ten thousand years? Nonsense!

Over the years, none had emerged, yet over a hundred appeared during that period. The disparity was not just significant; it was terrifying. Perhaps there were issues with the Dao fusion. Or perhaps the owners of the fused Daos were still alive.

Su Yu didn't dwell on it. After asking a few general questions, he quickly said, "I'll heal. Once you're ready, we can launch the attack at any time! Not just the Daofuse Realm; we must capture the Eternals instantly. As for those below the Eternal Realm, they can't leave the domain. If they die, it will only cause a stir within the domain, with no impact outside!"

Below the Eternal Realm, Su Yu couldn't be bothered. He quickly added, "Try to capture them all alive. In the Four Realms, a single realm can't have more than twenty Eternals! Each necromancer marquis should handle one Eternal without any mistakes. Capture them alive! Assign three lords to each! If there aren't many Eternals, two Daofuse experts should handle one Eternal. Ignore those below the Eternal Realm. If mistakes occur even then... there will be consequences!"

Su Yu's final words were cold. If one or two Daofuse experts couldn't capture a single Eternal, they might as well die.

Everyone felt a chill in their hearts and dared not slack off. Su Yu continued, "Discuss among yourselves and make arrangements. Don't let several Daofuse experts deal with one Eternal while leaving others unattended. If the enemy self-destructs, causing too much commotion and alerting the three clans of gods, demons, and immortals, the surprise attack will lose its meaning!"

"I, the Great Zhou King, the South King, and Marquis Lanshan will jointly deal with the Daofuse Realm!"

These four, one Heavenly King, the Great Zhou King of the second tier, Marquis Lanshan close to the second tier, and Su Yu, the weakest among them, should be able to handle a fourth-tier Daofuse expert. If they couldn't, they might as well have lived in vain!

"Try not to cause any slaughter!" Su Yu added, "Necromancer slaughter might trigger a rule punishment, causing changes at the Upper Realm's gate! Strive not to kill anyone; capturing them all alive is best!"

"Understood!" Everyone responded in unison.

Su Yu smiled and vanished into thin air, going to heal and observe his little darling. It was also best to investigate which necromancer marquis it was, as he hadn't been sure of the specific identity before.

Now that he was out, even if the Dragonblood Marquis was useless, there was an advantage—positioning. Su Yu could sense the location of his book page! He could pinpoint the Dragonblood Marquis's position, and thus, the movements of the North King and others were all within Su Yu's grasp!

...

While healing, Su Yu used the book page to sense everything. On the first day, there was no movement. The Dragonblood Marquis's position remained unchanged, seemingly unaffected.

On the second day, the Dragonblood Marquis still hadn't moved, but Su Yu noticed some anomalies.

...

In the North King's territory, when the North King retreated, he took many elites with him, including numerous lords and Sunmoon necromancers. Now, in the Land of the Abyss, the North King was more low-key, claiming a much smaller territory than before.

The new North King's mansion was much simpler than before. All necromancer marquises were not far from the North King, but they didn't stay together. After all, they were intelligent necromancers, each with their own secrets, preferring not to gather.

In the simple Dragonblood Hall, the Dragonblood Marquis endured for a day, but his heart grew increasingly restless. The opportunity was right before him. He wanted to act but feared causing too much commotion and attracting the North King's attention.

Today, the Dragonblood Marquis couldn't hold back any longer. He seized the opportunity. In the hall, several lords knelt, reporting news. One lord, nervous, said, "My lord, the Land of the Abyss is too complex. Although there are few necromancers, many strong ones exist, and there are even hints of hidden necromancer marquises. The Dragonblood Army has faced many obstacles and suffered significant losses..."

"Useless!" The Dragonblood Marquis roared, "Do you expect my army of hundreds of thousands of necromancers to remain in this tiny canyon? Useless! What use are you!"

He merely intended to scold them, but a thought involuntarily surfaced in his mind: "Destiny is with me, time waits for no one, devour everything..."

In his anger, mixed with anticipation and anxiety, he saw the kneeling necromancer lords, silent and trembling, and grew even more furious. Suddenly, a fierce look flashed in his eyes, and he shouted, "It's all because of you useless fools, making me lose face!"

A massive hand suddenly struck the one who had spoken. Boom! Under the terrified and horrified gazes of the other necromancer lords, the Dragonblood Marquis, in his rage, shattered the defenseless lord into pieces!

The lord's Dao instantly collapsed, and in that moment, the Dragonblood Marquis's eyes flashed with a blood-red light. In an instant, his Dao seemed to come alive, and a massive mouth emerged, devouring the lord's Dao!

Dao devouring was generally unheard of. However, Su Yu's Mark of Civilization was designed for devouring, fundamentally meant to consume blood essence and flesh, simulating and outlining the Dao.

At this moment, the power of the lord's Dao was directly absorbed into the Dragonblood Marquis's illusory Dao page. Of course, to the Dragonblood Marquis, it seemed as if his Dao seed had consumed it.

He was instantly overjoyed! It really worked! Previously, as a strong expert, killing a necromancer lord and even devouring their death imprint wasn't very useful. But now, the Dragonblood Marquis clearly felt his Dao seed grow stronger.

A slight increase was normal! After all, the illusory Dao Su Yu outlined wasn't particularly strong, quite weak. Now, devouring a necromancer lord provided some enhancement. To Su Yu, the improvement was moderate.

For an existence like Marquis Dragonblood, who has been unable to advance for tens of thousands of years, even a small improvement is the difference between heaven and earth!

He quickly absorbed the power of the Great Dao from his opponent, a satisfied gleam in his eyes. Yet soon, a deeper hunger emerged.

Not enough!

I need more!

This power is too little, insufficient for my advancement.

At that moment, a restless urge surged within him, even contemplating killing and devouring the other lords in the hall. Just as this thought emerged, waves of willpower swept in from afar.

Marquis Dragonblood's heart trembled, and he quickly regained his composure, coldly saying, "Useless trash, not worth mourning! Go out and clear all obstacles around us, expand the territory. With so little death energy, how can we advance? Gather millions of undead in one place; how much death energy would that provide for us to absorb?"

He maintained his anger, shouting, "Get out!"

The several undead lords, trembling with fear, quickly left the hall.

In the next moment, the figures of the North King and several marquises appeared in the Dragonblood Hall. The North King frowned slightly, "Dragonblood, we didn't bring many lords with us. Losing the North King Domain makes it difficult to replenish them in the future! Don't kill lords recklessly out of momentary anger!"

He was somewhat displeased!

Without the Celestial River of Death to replenish troops, these millions of undead are the last of their resources!

There are only about fifty or sixty lord-level beings left, with each marquis having only three to five under their command.

If you keep killing them, won't they all be gone in a few days?

The North King understood one thing: strong beings emerge from the weak. Without a new generation, their group would eventually be wiped out!

Perhaps there won't be any immediate impact, but in the long run, the power of the North King's domain will inevitably collapse.

Marquis Dragonblood frowned, "Lord North King, these are my subordinates..."

The North King said sternly, "That's why I'm only advising you!"

Marquis Dragonblood replied in a low voice, "They are incompetent, useless! I ordered them to expand the territory, but they have achieved nothing. They claim the Land of the Abyss is full of hidden experts, but that's just an excuse, a fear of encountering strong enemies!"

At this, Marquis Dragonblood was somewhat angry and said, "Since these useless fools can't do it, I request permission to personally expand the North King Domain! I also want to see how terrifying this Land of the Abyss really is! Undead Marquis? Lord Heavenly King, I also want to test the strength of the undead marquises here!"

"You're new here..."

Before the North King could finish, Marquis Dragonblood said in a deep voice, "Lord Heavenly King, are you afraid of provoking those guys? Those sealed deep within? Do you know, last time we went, Dizhi Luo secretly transmitted a message to us, asking us to assassinate you and join them! You don't want to provoke them, but they want to deal with you!"

The North King's expression changed slightly.

Marquis Dragonblood continued coldly, "I'm not the only one. I believe many have received Dizhi Luo's message, yet no one told you. I think... if you keep lying low, be careful not to be betrayed by your own people! I'm straightforward and decisive, but I know one thing: if you die, we might not have a good end unless one of us becomes a Heavenly King... is that possible?"

He spoke with a mocking tone, "Lord, are you still worried about me provoking those guys?"

The North King's expression shifted slightly.

Dizhi Luo, secretly colluding with his undead marquises.

This was understandable, but the key point was... no one told him, which was terrifying. If Marquis Dragonblood hadn't spoken up, he wouldn't have known until now.

He had fourteen undead marquises under his command, yet only one informed him!

This... was not a good sign!

Clearly, his lying low, his patience, the strength of the Human Race, and the powerhouses in the sealed land had made these guys tacitly agree, even preparing to sell out the North King!

The North King looked at Marquis Dragonblood for a long time, then smiled, "Nonsense! You! Dragonblood, I actually knew about this long ago, and many have told me. However, some things don't need to be said."

He laughed, "You make it sound like everyone is going to betray me! Such treacherous intentions! Since you insist on expanding the territory, fine, of the 57 lords who came with us, you killed one, leaving you with only three. Each marquis will assign one lord to accompany you!"

He was also secretly angry!

In the end, it was this reckless Dragonblood who spoke up.

Fine, since you won't say it, I'll weaken your forces first. Each marquis will assign one lord, so Marquis Dragonblood will command sixteen lords, and he himself has eight lords as guards.

Fifty-six lords, with him and Marquis Dragonblood commanding twenty-four, is not a small number.

He didn't believe anyone would dare refuse at this moment!

After all, he was still a Heavenly King, unless these people had already decided to rebel now!

Sure enough, the other marquises said nothing.

Some just looked at Marquis Dragonblood with strange eyes, cursing him in their hearts. They might not necessarily want to betray the North King, just leaving themselves a way out. After all, the powerhouses in the sealed land seemed more numerous now.

Everyone tacitly agreed, not saying anything. If the powerhouses in the sealed land really came out, the North King might become a sacrifice. If not, they would continue to muddle along.

Dragonblood, on the other hand, just said it outright, this idiot!

Do you think currying favor with the North King will benefit you?

Everyone was angry. The North King was not the same as before when he controlled the North King Domain.

Outside the North King Domain, the North King was still strong, but without the power of laws to suppress, he could only fight five or six undead marquises at most. Before, in the North King Domain, with the North King Seal suppressing, he could fight eight!

Everyone was speechless, this idiot, they were fed up with him!

But Marquis Dragonblood just sneered, not bothering to care.

Very good!

Sixteen lords, excellent, and not only that, he had sown discord between the North King and the other marquises. He was even considering whether to contact the North King next time to secretly kill a few marquises!

Kill them openly!

The North King probably wouldn't even care if they were killed.

"But before that, I must show my loyalty, deal a heavy blow to the vassals of those sealed guys, and gain the North King's trust. Those guys can't come out now; at this moment, the North King is still the ruler!"

Marquis Dragonblood's heart was racing, his once calm undead heart now surging with ambition!

Ambition was swelling continuously.

What North King, what powerhouses in the sealed land, would eventually become his food!

But for now, he wasn't at that level yet and needed to be patient.

When he reached the Heavenly King level, then he would act.

He quickly said, "Lord, I will immediately gather strong forces to eliminate those guys. What Dizhi Luo, laughable, wait until they're unsealed!"

Marquis Dragonblood said sinisterly, "They're just a bunch of prisoners! When they're unsealed, who knows if we'll still be alive. Do they really think the Human Lord and South King are easy to deal with? When they attack, can we rely on those unsealed guys? Laughable, we have to rely on the North King!"

For the first time, the North King felt Marquis Dragonblood was so wise!

Yes.

They're just a bunch of unsealed guys!

If Su Yu and the others really attacked, these guys might not even be able to come out. At that time, wouldn't they have to rely on him?

A bunch of foolish guys!

He was angry inside but didn't show it. At this moment, he felt that Marquis Dragonblood, though seemingly reckless, was actually very clear-headed. As for the previous killing of his subordinate lords, that was a minor issue.

Killing a lord, so what? Just kill them!

And Marquis Dragonblood quickly stood up, "Lord, I will gather the elite and establish our own domain in this Land of the Abyss! As for some deaths, if they die, they die. The Lord is thinking about the future, and whether there is a future is uncertain!"

Leaving these words, he arrogantly flew out, pointing at some lords, shouting, "You, and you... follow this marquis to battle!"

He was only supposed to gather thirteen lords, including his own, making sixteen lords, but he gathered twenty, including two from the North King's subordinates and two top-level experts close to the Daofuse level.

In the hall, among the marquises, someone was dissatisfied and was about to speak when the North King said lightly, "Let him go. If he wants to take people to expand the territory, it's a good thing. This place is unfamiliar to everyone, and it's dangerous. Or... if anyone else is willing, they can go too. Killing a marquis is also a good thing!"

Everyone was silent.

Forget it, let this reckless Dragonblood go.

There must be vassals and spies of Dizhi Luo here. The undead marquis who attacked the North Heavenly King last time was not weak. Going to expand the territory was risky.

If Marquis Dragonblood wanted to go, let him go!

Thus, Marquis Dragonblood took twenty lords and nearly a million undead, quickly heading towards the unexplored territory. Marquis Dragonblood was also excited, able to openly distance himself from the North King and the others!

Some lord deaths were normal.

As long as he could kill some strong beings, it was justified. He could even use these people's power to kill Dizhi Luo's subordinates, hopefully causing a war between both sides, and he might benefit from it.

...

And all of this, Su Yu could somewhat sense.

While healing, Su Yu couldn't help but laugh. When someone has ambition, even an undead can quickly transform, change their ways, and start using their brains.

At this moment, he roughly knew who it was.

Marquis Dragonblood!

As his undead page grew, he could increasingly sense Marquis Dragonblood's movements, thoughts, and even some ideas. These actions might be hard to guess for those unaware of Marquis Dragonblood's situation, but Su Yu, as the instigator, was naturally clear.

"Everything is under control!"

Su Yu sighed in his heart, unable to help but wonder, if everything is under my control, then... if the River of Time has a master, are those who open paths in the River of Time also under control?

The Master of the Death Path is alive. Does that mean all these undead are under his control? Taking it a step further, if the masters of each path are alive, does that mean everything is under their control? In this world, who is truly controlling whom? Who is truly in charge?

Who are the Culture King and his allies really fighting against? Why does the Culture King want to sever his path? Is it simply because the path is too weak, or is it because he feels insecure, knowing that no matter how strong the pen dao becomes, it is still built upon the River of Time?

"The secrets of the Myriad Realms are far more than I imagined!"

As for now, the Upper Realm and the Myriad Realms are no longer such great secrets. The real mystery lies in the disappearance of the ancient times and whether it is related to all of this.

"It's getting more and more interesting!"

Su Yu smiled faintly. The opening of the Heaven Gate had revealed so much to him, and the Book of Time and the Mark of Civilization had allowed him to comprehend so much more.

...

He didn't bother healing his injuries; they were manageable and almost healed. Insights into the Great Dao don't come from merely meditating in seclusion. True comprehension comes from battles, schemes, planning, experiences, and insights. Simply meditating in seclusion is laughable; even after a hundred thousand years, one might only make a small step forward.

Old Turtle and others have been in seclusion for too long. What they don't understand, they will never understand. Whatever their strength was a hundred thousand years ago, it remains the same now. That's the downside of seclusion.

Soon, Su Yu reappeared from the void.

At this moment, another figure joined the crowd—it was Old Turtle. Seeing Su Yu, he smiled and said, "Emperor Yu, I won't enter the realm. I have suppressive power, but if there's trouble, you can push the opponent into the Death Realm! Once in the Death Realm, even if they're at the Heavenly King level, this old one can fight them!"

He quickly added, "The Great Ming King has entered the Daofuse Realm, but the commotion was significant, and the Myriad Realms might have sensed it."

The Great Ming King had finally reached the Daofuse Realm!

Su Yu smiled, "No matter. Now that we have one more Daofuse, the myriad races can't do anything about it! Having one more is good; it adds to our deterrence. Let them know if they must!"

Su Yu was genuinely pleased with the Great Ming King's advancement. The Great Xia King and the Great Ming King were among the earliest supporters of his. Unfortunately, Su Yu didn't understand formations, and the path of the physical body was more suited for the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King. Otherwise, he would have helped the Great Ming King reach the Daofuse Realm sooner.

Now, it's good that he advanced on his own. This is a good thing.

Thanks to the West King's Consort!

The West King's Consort's concealment formation must have greatly aided the Great Ming King. Otherwise, after switching paths, he couldn't have advanced so quickly and easily entered the Daofuse Realm. This means the West King's Consort's formation allowed him to see many profound truths of the Great Dao.

Speaking of the West King's Consort, she's still sealed by me!

Actually, not much time has passed, just about a month.

What is a month to someone like the West King's Consort? As long as Su Yu doesn't seal her for too long, a month is just Su Yu honing her temperament.

And indeed, that's the case.

At this moment, the West King's Consort was still waiting eagerly, hoping Su Yu would see her. She believed she had performed well during this time, showing a mix of stubbornness and vulnerability, unwillingness and helplessness, despair and submission...

With such a performance, if Su Yu were secretly observing, he would surely be moved.

Little did she know, Su Yu had only looked at her twice, not to observe anything else but to ensure she didn't know too much about the outside world and commit suicide. That wouldn't do!

This person still had great use for Su Yu, even as bait for the Upper Realm. She couldn't be allowed to die now.

Su Yu himself thought about taking some time to comfort the West King's Consort.

He must give her hope to live!

He mustn't let her be stifled for too long and end up committing suicide, or he would cry.

"The Great Ming King's advancement to the Daofuse Realm is a good thing. Now that the Myriad Realms are sealed, as long as it's not too obvious, even if we approach the other realms, they won't sense it!"

Su Yu chuckled and quickly said, "Senior Hongmeng, send a message to the guards, have them relay to Chief Wan to have Chief Wan, the Iron Devourer Emperor, the two Devourer Emperors, the Book Spirit, and the Tea Plant quickly head to the endless void to besiege the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao! Trap them in the endless void and don't let them ruin my plans. These two haven't even entered a small realm to hide yet!"

"Understood!"

Old Turtle quickly used the connection between the guards to send a message to Wan Tiansheng.

First, go and block those two!

"Relay the message to the Great Ming King, head to the Phoenix Realm first. If there's any movement, immediately set up a defensive formation. If there's no movement, then forget it!"

"Understood!"

Old Turtle sent the message again, feeling a bit excited, "Shall we take down the Phoenix Realm first?"

"Yes!"

Su Yu smiled, "First the Phoenix Realm, then the Ape Realm, followed by the Kunpeng Realm, and finally the Dragon Realm! The Heavenly Dragon Marquis is the strongest, and I'm afraid dealing with him might cause changes that would disrupt our subsequent surprise attacks."

Everyone had no objections; Su Yu's arrangements were very thorough!

Even the Great Zhou King felt that working with Su Yu was quite comfortable. Su Yu had thought of most things, and what he hadn't thought of, he might have prepared for.

This was much more comfortable than working with the Great Qin King, and even more so than with the Hundred Battle King.

At least, working with Su Yu, although his strength was weaker, you would feel confident that he would succeed because this guy's mind worked quickly, often making the absolutely correct choice in an instant!

And Su Yu, taking a deep breath, said solemnly, "Only success is allowed, no failure!"

Dozens of Daofuse experts against one Daofuse expert—if they can't win, they might as well not live!

But the biggest challenge is capturing a Daofuse expert alive!

That's the key!

"Great Zhou King, your Stealth Dao must be used to its fullest!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "Whether we can capture them alive depends heavily on your Stealth Dao! The South King and Marquis Lanshan will mainly break through the Phoenix Emperor's physical body and imprison their sea of consciousness. The Great Zhou King will ensure they don't make too much noise, and I will enter the River of Time to find a way to seal the Phoenix Emperor's power of the Great Dao! Don't give them a chance to self-destruct!"

"Understood!"

The powerful figures were also very serious. Killing was certain, but capturing alive was the challenge.

...

Phoenix Realm.

On a massive phoenix tree, a grand palace was built—this was the Phoenix Emperor's Palace.

At this moment, the Phoenix Emperor was actually quite uneasy.

This unease made her somewhat fearful.

She didn't know if it was because of the recent deaths of several other Daofuse experts, but ever since the Nether Emperor and others died, she hadn't been at peace.

In the grand hall, not only was she uneasy, but the other Eternal experts were also uneasy.

The lower realm had been defeated.

Despite having an overwhelming advantage, they ultimately suffered a crushing defeat. It was laughable.

In total, 11 Daofuse experts had died.

Even so, the myriad races still had 12 Daofuse experts, which, on the surface, wasn't much weaker than the human race. But everyone understood it was useless.

The Immortals, Gods, and Demons had no will to fight to the death!

Because they had a way out, with a way out, they thought too much. With a way out, who would be willing to fight the human race to the death?

Once the Upper Realm opens, the human race will be doomed.

With this mindset, everyone was thinking of self-preservation.

At this moment, the Phoenix Emperor was extremely uneasy. She gathered all the Eternal experts in the Phoenix Emperor's Palace.

Besides her, the Phoenix Race had 16 Eternal experts. Some had died before, but they were still strong.

With a dignified expression, the Phoenix Emperor looked at the somber strong members of her race below and said with authority, "The defeat in the lower realm is a foregone conclusion! Now, only the opening of the Upper Realm can curb this demon Su Yu! And Su Yu himself said that before the Upper Realm opens, he will definitely attack the myriad races! He said five years, but that might just be a smokescreen to confuse us. It might only be three years, or even two..."

The Phoenix Emperor took a deep breath, "Our race is not as strong as the Immortals, Gods, and Demons. If the human race attacks us fiercely, we might be wiped out. So, I want to ask everyone, how can we avoid this crisis? As long as we avoid this, once the Upper Realm opens, the human race will no longer have a chance to be arrogant!"

She speculated that Su Yu's claim of five years shouldn't be taken seriously!

This demon's words are always half-truths.

If he says five years, halve it.

Two or three years is just a blink of an eye.

In two or three years, the race would find it difficult to produce a Daofuse expert. With only herself, how could she resist Su Yu and his allies?

An Eternal expert said solemnly, "Emperor, the demon Su is now unstoppable in the lower realm! He has also taken control of the Fate Realm, cutting off our connection to the Upper Realm. We should not let the Upper Realm passage loosen, leading to people from the Upper Realm being ambushed by him! If the demon Su really attacks our realm... then we can only fight to the death, trying to preserve some seeds to revive our race's glory after the war ends!"

"Is that all we can do?"

The Phoenix Emperor sighed. She actually hoped someone would come up with a plan to make Su Yu not target them, preferably targeting the Immortals, Gods, Demons, or even the Dragon Realm.

As long as Su Yu and his allies attack one realm, the other side's desperate resistance might lead to the Upper Realm opening prematurely. Better them than us!

As they were speaking, the Phoenix Emperor slightly frowned, "Today, I feel uneasy, as if something is about to happen. Is the realm passage sealed?"

"It's sealed!"

An Eternal expert quickly said seriously, "It's absolutely guarded, even if a Daofuse expert attacks, it can hold for a while and won't be broken!"

"That's good!"

The Phoenix Emperor felt she was a bit scared. The great war had just ended, and all realms were sealed. At this moment, there was no war in the Myriad Realms, so why worry unnecessarily?

Just then, the Phoenix Emperor slightly frowned, "Do you... feel anything?"

"Hmm?"

Everyone was puzzled. Feel what?

The Phoenix Emperor didn't say anything, just probed a bit. Outside the grand hall, a small phoenix was playing carefree with a few other small phoenixes, seemingly chasing a fireball.

This was also a little game of the Phoenix Race, one the Phoenix Emperor herself had played as a child.

The fireball was a type of flame from Phoenix Mountain, known to aid in comprehending the Great Dao. Some powerful individuals would collect it, but the quantity was limited, often leaving the younger generation to compete for it. Chasing the fireball was a famous game among the Phoenix Race. The fireball, imbued with some willpower, would fly around erratically, and the competitors would try to capture it. The one who flew the fastest, feared the fire the least, and had the strongest control would usually win.

At this moment, the fireball was swiftly flying towards the main entrance of the grand hall. The other Eternals noticed it and could only smile wryly. These young ones were carefree, unaware of the looming dangers. 

"Let them play," one Eternal remarked, seeing the Phoenix Emperor's displeased expression. "Tianhuang, you shouldn't let the fire seeds play around without rules!"

The fireball was about to enter the hall. The Phoenix Emperor, in a foul mood, was bound to reprimand these juniors for their recklessness. 

"Understood!" a young phoenix responded, yet the fireball continued its trajectory towards the hall. The Phoenix Emperor frowned, feeling an intense unease. Her willpower swept through the area but found nothing amiss. However, as she focused on the fireball, her expression suddenly changed. Something was wrong. What was wrapped within this fire seed? A threat? It was impossible unless a Daofuse expert personally descended. Even if this fire seed was a divine symbol of a ruler of laws, it wouldn't easily threaten a Daofuse expert.

"Scoundrel!" the Phoenix Emperor roared in anger, sensing something amiss. She struck out at the fireball. The other Eternals hadn't noticed anything unusual. One of them even advised, "Emperor, it's just the juniors playing around. I'll drive them away immediately..."

Why make a big deal out of it? After all, the bastard Lantian had stolen three thousand phoenix eggs, leaving the clan with few juniors. Now, everyone was more tolerant of these young ones. Besides, with the threat of annihilation looming, why bother with such trivial matters? The Phoenix Emperor was being unreasonable!

As he was advising, the Phoenix Emperor's expression drastically changed. At the moment she struck, the fire seed disintegrated, releasing a surge of deathly aura. The fire seed vanished, revealing a large seal beneath it. That wasn't all—a small spatial vortex suddenly appeared below the seal.

"Hold your breath, don't shout!" A low voice came from the vortex, causing the Phoenix Emperor's face to change dramatically. The Great Zhou King! A necromancer passage! It's over! She was about to roar and unleash her power, but her expression momentarily faltered. In the next instant, a torrent of deathly aura surged forth.

The South King appeared instantly, striking at the Phoenix Emperor. Simultaneously, over a dozen necromancer marquises emerged, each targeting the Eternals. The Great Zhou King followed closely, sweat dripping from his forehead as he shouted, "Hold on! There's always a way out. As long as you endure, every difficulty can be overcome!"

"Endure the storm, and the sea will be calm!" 

The Phoenix Emperor struggled violently. No, she couldn't endure! She couldn't! Despair filled her eyes. It was over. The Phoenix Realm was finished. A necromancer passage had opened right at their doorstep, in the Phoenix Emperor's hall. Unbelievable! It had opened right under her nose!

As the Phoenix Emperor struggled fiercely, a gentle voice echoed, "Lay down your weapons and preserve your race. I won't kill you. Killing won't bring peace. Peace requires negotiation. Let's have a good talk."

Su Yu! The Phoenix Emperor's eyes showed confusion. Su Yu. She would never forget his voice. What was he saying? Negotiation?

Su Yu, drenched in sweat, exerted the power of the "Saint" character to its fullest. He stepped into the River of Time, still chanting, "Negotiation is the only way out. Phoenix Emperor, sit down and let's talk."

"Hold on, let's talk it out!" The Great Zhou King urged, "Negotiation, patience, and hibernation are the only chances!"

The Phoenix Emperor's eyes flickered between clarity and confusion, filled with intense struggle. But she wasn't facing just one person; she was up against two master manipulators. One urged her to endure, wielding top-tier Daofuse combat strength. The other used the Saint Dao to enlighten her, with strength no weaker than hers. At this moment, Marquis Lanshan and the South King swiftly suppressed her Dao power. A Heavenly King, an existence she couldn't match, was also present. In the blink of an eye, her Dao power waned.

In the void, Su Yu drew with his pen, sketching words rapidly within her Phoenix Dao. Not only that, a page from the Mark of Civilization flew out, quickly entwining the Phoenix Dao. The South King struck, shattering her physical body, while Marquis Lanshan wielded the Human Lord Seal to suppress her sea of will.

The Great Zhou King continued to shout, "You must hold on! Endurance is the only way out. Trust me!"

Boom! The Phoenix Emperor's body exploded, her sea of will suppressed, her Dao sealed by countless words written by Su Yu's pen. The Mark of Civilization swept over, and the Saint Seal directly suppressed her. In an instant, the Phoenix Emperor vanished without uttering a word.

Simultaneously, over a dozen necromancer marquises, along with dozens of monarchs, swiftly crushed the Eternals. Their speed was astonishing. In the blink of an eye, the entire hall was left with only a few young phoenixes outside, playing, each in a daze. At that moment, the leading young phoenix spread its wings, laughing, "Dear friends, let's become one. Out of sight, out of mind!"

Its wings enveloped the young phoenixes, and in an instant, flames rose. The young phoenixes, showing expressions of pain, gradually turned to ash, disappearing before everyone's eyes.

The Great Zhou King's mouth twitched slightly, while Su Yu beamed with a radiant smile. He couldn't help but glance at Lantian. Truly impressive! This guy had previously located the Grand Mansion Seal, which wasn't here, but Lantian seemed to have detected its presence. Lantian dared to act, directly kicking the Grand Mansion Seal under the Phoenix Emperor's nose! You had to admire that!

The battle went smoothly! Almost without a sound, the Phoenix Race's experts were captured in one fell swoop! And Lantian, grinning, said, "What are you standing around for? There's still an Eternal at the passage entrance. Hurry, don't let them escape!"

"Impossible!" Su Yu laughed. "Great Zhou King, go capture them!"

"Marquis Lanshan, capture all the Sunmoon and Skysoar experts. Kill any who try to escape, and take the rest as prisoners!"

Su Yu's smile widened as the Mark of Civilization swept through, suppressing all the Eternals! Only their seas of will remained, making suppression easy. Don't kill them yet! Keep them! The Phoenix page will soon grow!

Su Yu walked out of the hall, his smile radiant as he overlooked the Phoenix Realm. The environment was beautiful. I like it! Without much effort, a realm was captured! The remaining three realms will soon fall into my hands. Soon, only the God, Demon, and Immortal races will remain beyond my control in the Myriad Realms!

At this moment, the necromancers moved, causing the entire Phoenix Realm to tremble instantly! With disbelief and shock, these weak phoenixes couldn't resist so many necromancer experts. Without a single Eternal, they couldn't even commit suicide under these Daofuse experts!

In the blink of an eye, a large number of Phoenix Race members were strung together by the necromancer marquises and dragged towards Su Yu! The entire Phoenix Realm had completely fallen! And outside, there was no sound, no disturbance. The Phoenix Realm had fallen!
