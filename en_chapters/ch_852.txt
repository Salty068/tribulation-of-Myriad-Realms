Chapter 852: Understanding (Seeking Subscription)

Within the Heaven Gate, most of the space is an endless void, akin to a land of chaos. Rarely does anyone open up a world here. Even if they do, it's seldom that outsiders are allowed to enter. Each world here is a true Dao field, my domain, my Dao!

The Myriad Realms, that is the Dao field opened by the Master of Time. If the Master of Time were present, the Myriad Realms would be his domain, extending wherever he wished. In this domain, unless one is significantly stronger than the Master of Time, no one can match him.

Thus, many within the Heaven Gate do not have their own territory, wandering between heaven and earth. Some powerful beings do open small worlds, but they do not last long due to the instability of the entire realm, which often leads to destruction.

Currently, Gui was quickly moving from the projection of Su Yu's Heaven Gate. Before long, he returned to a dark mountain suspended in the void—his old lair.

Sensing Gui's return, a patrolling expert soon greeted him, "Dao Master, recently there have been signs of tremors at Guiyun Mountain. Could it be the onset of a destruction period? We need you to investigate and make plans."

Gui frowned slightly. So soon? He spoke with authority, "I understand. The Heaven Gate is about to open, and anomalies are frequent. It seems it will soon overlap with the Myriad Realms!"

The patrolling expert showed a hint of anticipation, quickly saying, "I hope we can rebuild Guiyun Mountain in the Myriad Realms!"

Gui said nothing. Previously, he might have thought the same—arriving in the Myriad Realms, establishing his Dao field, and claiming a territory. But now, having inadvertently received a signal from Su Yu's Heaven Gate, he hoped to arrive in the Myriad Realms ahead of time. Building a Dao field there would be too humble.

If I can enter the Myriad Realms a few years earlier, the possibilities are endless! A 16-path expert should be invincible in the Myriad Realms now!

With these thoughts, he didn't say much more and quickly asked, "Recently, I've sensed fluctuations in the heavens. Has that outsider been fighting again?"

"The Culture King and the others?" the patroller asked urgently. "They've clashed again, even drawing out that overlord. Dao Master, you might not know, but it's said that the one from Eternal Life Mountain has left the forbidden ground..."

Gui took a deep breath. So soon? I've only been gone a few days, and that one has already emerged?

Eternal Life Mountain, one of the forbidden grounds behind the Heaven Gate, is home to an overlord from the era of creation and has been the main opponent of the Culture King and his allies over the years.

The patroller continued, "However, this one left the forbidden ground... not to confront those outsiders but to seek the overlord of the Necro Forbidden Ground!"

Gui frowned slightly. The Necro Overlord. Are they planning to start a war before the Heaven Gate opens? These overlords of forbidden grounds are immensely powerful, each a supreme top-tier expert. Previously, there was a tacit understanding not to engage in major conflicts. The last major conflict was long ago when the Lord of the Undead entered the Heaven Gate, as he was considered an outsider, leading to a top-tier battle.

However, this one suppressed the four directions with overwhelming strength, and the other overlords chose to ignore it, allowing him to establish himself behind the Heaven Gate.

Now, after years of peace, is war about to break out again?

He fell into contemplation, then said, "So, the Culture King and his allies aren't being pursued?"

"Yes, those two disappeared together without any commotion. They might be fighting in private or haven't encountered each other."

The patroller responded, still somewhat expectant, "Dao Master, do you think these two will erupt into battle?"

Gui replied solemnly, "Don't hope for war. You might find it interesting when such beings fight... but once these supreme beings clash, and the battle sweeps across the heavens and earth... then you'll understand what true destruction means!"

The patroller nodded immediately. That's true. When these supreme beings erupt into battle, it's extremely dangerous.

"Understood..."

Gui, eager to attend to his matters, didn't say much more and quickly instructed, "In the coming days, patrol more frequently. Also, notify some of my old friends that I'll be hosting a Dao discussion at Guiyun Mountain in a few days!"

"Will the Dao Master discuss the path to advancement?" The patroller was intrigued and somewhat excited. The Dao Master's advancement to the 16-path realm makes him a powerful presence even behind the Heaven Gate, and Guiyun Mountain's status has been steadily rising!

However, the Dao Master hasn't been active for long since his advancement, remaining quiet all this time. Now that he's hosting a Dao discussion, many big figures will likely be interested. After all, a new 16-path expert is a rare occurrence.

"Dao Master, I'll immediately invite the various experts... Is there anything else you wish to instruct?"

Gui pondered for a moment, "Tell them to bring some rule fragments and the like. If the situation allows, there will be some transactions at the Dao discussion. It's been many years since we've met, and this is a chance for everyone to exchange the treasures they need."

"Alright!" The patroller was also pleased. Transactions are good. Behind the Heaven Gate, it's challenging to trade. The endless void makes it difficult to find a fixed place for transactions, and even if found, it's risky to trade.

Top-tier experts aren't interested in these matters, nor do they care to protect anyone or establish any markets. The weak might want to, but they lack the strength.

Someone once tried, but unfortunately, they set up near a forbidden ground. An overlord from the forbidden ground, annoyed by the market's noise, casually destroyed it, resulting in countless deaths. Since then, few have dared to recklessly establish markets.

Behind the Heaven Gate, the pursuit of peace and silence is the mainstream of the era of destruction.

Gui said no more, though he was still somewhat hesitant. Seeking out the Culture King... is dangerous.

The Culture King and the Martial King are both formidable killers. Over the years, they've fought against an overlord of a forbidden ground without falling behind. Together, they might truly match that one.

However, that one has existed for a long time, with descendants and a legacy that has produced supreme experts. If not for their numbers, the Culture King and Martial King might not fear them.

Such beings are terrifying to Gui. If they encounter a powerful presence, they might retreat, but if he seeks them out, he might find them, as those two might still want to vent their anger by killing someone.

Should I go or not?

Various thoughts surfaced, and Gui gritted his teeth, deciding to go! If I don't seek them out, and Su Yu asks why the Culture King didn't give... he probably won't believe it.

Whether the Culture King will give or not, Gui feels the chances are slim, as they don't know Su Yu. But perhaps they might give?

The identity of the tenth-generation Human Lord might be useful.

Various thoughts flashed through Gui's mind, and soon, he spoke, "I'll be away for a few days. Notify me immediately if anything happens!"

"Understood!" The patroller responded, watching Gui leave with some curiosity. The Dao Master rarely ventures far. Why is he suddenly in the mood to wander around?

The Dao Master isn't very bold. Indeed, in this place, one might accidentally trespass into a forbidden ground and be killed by a powerful being. Perhaps the Dao Master feels that after reaching the 16-path realm, there's no need to be so cautious anymore!

...

Gui only knew the general area where the Culture King and his allies were located. These two have always been there, rarely leaving.

It's said that the one from Eternal Life Mountain captured the Culture King's sister, intending to lure and kill these two. Gui doesn't know the specifics, but he knows that the Culture King and Martial King have stayed in the Eternal Life Mountain forbidden area for many years.

Even if they retreat, they quickly return, never leaving for long, constantly pressuring Eternal Life Mountain, leaving it struggling to cope.

The master of Eternal Life Mountain has attempted to kill them several times, but to no avail.

These two are powerful, and at critical moments, if they find themselves outmatched, they quickly escape. Pursuing them is futile, as the Culture King is highly skilled. Outside the Heaven Gate, the outcome would be uncertain.

However, within the Heaven Gate, the Culture King should be somewhat weakened.

Various thoughts arose in Gui's mind, and soon, he stepped into an area of absolute darkness and silence.

Outside this area, there are some small Dao fields. Some first-class experts have also established their territories. Some Dao Masters even enjoy creating light, and there are quite a few people, so it's not entirely dead silent.

However, outside the Eternal Life Mountain forbidden area, it's truly dead silent, as no one dares to come here. Those who do are either killed by the strong of Eternal Life Mountain or by the Culture King and Martial King.

Over the years, this place has become a dead zone.

At this moment, Gui felt somewhat apprehensive. Of course, he's not foolish and didn't come in person. His true self is hidden on the periphery, and he's only controlling a clone to investigate.

Gui was slightly apprehensive. Previously, he would never have dared to approach this place. After becoming a first-class expert, his courage increased slightly, but it's still best not to come to this cursed place without reason.

This place has seen many unfortunate souls killed over the years.

Humanoid creatures are fine, but non-humanoid ones... it's said that the Martial King gets green-eyed at the sight of them, supposedly out of hunger. Who knows?

With such thoughts, he was extremely cautious, probing bit by bit.

Afraid of being mistakenly killed, he could only emit a faint voice, "Lord Culture King, I have a matter to discuss!"

This way, if the other party sees him in the dark and plans a surprise attack, hearing his voice might prevent them from instantly killing his clone.

After calling for a while, there was no response.

Gui was getting anxious. That bastard Su Yu only gave him three days.

That scoundrel is pushing too hard.

"Lord Culture King, Gui has a matter to discuss..."

He continued to call out.

...

At the same time.

Not far from his clone, the Culture King, dressed in white robes, stood with his hands behind his back, silently watching Gui's clone. His eyes shone with divine light as he observed the clone, calculating the location of Gui's true self.

Martial King impatiently said, "What's the point? Just kill him and be done with it. What are you looking at?"

Clearly up to no good! Such a guy, just slay him and it's over.

Culture King didn't respond to him. His eyes flickered with divine light, and after a long while, he looked into the distant void. It seemed that the real body of this guy was over there, just outside the forbidden zone's coverage.

Culture King raised his eyebrows slightly, "Wait."

"Oh!" Martial King didn't care much. So what if it's a first-class? Even among first-class, there are strong and weak ones. This guy doesn't seem like much.

He wasn't interested in entangling with this guy named Gui. He suggested, "That guy's gone out. Why don't we storm his lair, wipe out his lineage, and rescue Wenyu..."

Culture King didn't respond. It wasn't that simple.

"Say something! That's your sister, and you're just going to ignore it?"

Culture King turned his head to look at him and smiled, "Why the rush? Do you really think that guy has gone far? It's just a pretense, a trick to lure us into his territory. By then, it would be hard to escape!"

"But..."

Martial King wasn't entirely clueless. He was still a bit agitated, "But waiting for him to return is even more troublesome! Isn't he trying to bait us? Then let's take this chance and strike him!"

Culture King didn't reply. He looked again at Gui's avatar, raising his eyebrows slightly, "Do you think he's a pawn, a bait, or does he really have something to discuss with us?"

"What could it be?" Martial King scoffed, "A guy who wasn't even famous suddenly shows up, of course he's bait! Probably arranged by that turtle bastard!"

Culture King chuckled. Not necessarily.

He quickly assessed in his mind, weighing the possibilities, and suddenly, his figure flickered.

Over there, Gui was still cautiously calling out. Suddenly, his vision blurred, and when it cleared, he was horrified. Even though he was just an avatar, as a first-class, even his avatar was extremely strong. Yet, without any sense of it, he was pulled away by the opponent!

Terrifying!

Gui was about to speak when a figure appeared before him, dressed in a white robe, with an ethereal aura and extraordinary demeanor. As soon as he appeared, a scene of the world revolving appeared before Gui's eyes, as if a large courtyard had emerged. A towering tree rose, a stone table appeared, and stone stools materialized.

"Sit down!"

Culture King's gentle voice came through. He sat down by himself, and a cup of tea appeared out of thin air in Gui's hand, causing Gui to turn pale with fright!

Too powerful!

Even though he was just an avatar, he was somewhat moved, his aura fluctuating. He subconsciously licked his lips and cautiously said, "I dare not. May I ask... are you Culture King?"

"You are the senior; I dare not assume."

Culture King picked up the teacup, took a sip, and smiled, "Are you looking for me?"

"Yes... no..."

Gui suddenly became nervous and hurriedly said, "My lord... please don't misunderstand. Someone entrusted me to find you..."

"Oh?"

Culture King smiled, "Is it someone from inside the gate or outside?"

Gui was startled!

How did you know it might be someone from outside the gate looking for you?

People from outside the gate can't contact those inside!

At this moment, a burly man appeared beside Culture King, impatiently saying, "Just capture his real body and search his memory. Why bother with all this trouble?"

"Silence!"

Culture King scolded lightly, then smiled, "Please continue, senior!"

Gui was very nervous. He had boasted to Su Yu, but facing these two, he was still very tense. First-class, very powerful! But these two were supreme beings who had tangled with a forbidden zone overlord for countless years!

Over the years, many first-class beings had been killed by the Eternal Mountain. Apart from that forbidden zone overlord, anyone encountering them faced the risk of falling.

Thinking of this, he dared not delay and hurriedly said, "It's... it's someone from outside..."

Martial King's eyes widened immediately, but Culture King gestured for him to hold back, thought for a moment, and smiled, "What did they entrust you to find me for?"

Gui was a bit surprised. Was Culture King pretending to be calm, or was he really indifferent? He said it was someone from outside, yet he reacted so calmly? Not even asking who it was?

Despite his inner complaints, guessing Culture King might be pretending, he dared not delay and cautiously said, "It's... it's the tenth generation Human Lord of the human race who entrusted me to find you. The tenth generation Human Lord is... is the tenth human lord after the Human Emperor..."

"I know."

Culture King smiled, "No need to explain that. Just tell me what he wants from me!"

Gui found it hard to speak. He feared that if he said it, these two might think he was a fraud and kill him. He was nervous. He hadn't asked Su Yu for any token... Of course, ordinary items couldn't be transmitted here anyway.

"He... he wants..."

Gui still found it difficult to say. How should I put this?

He said he wants you to hand over all the treasures you've accumulated over the years, the power of laws from the rulers you've slain, all the fragments of laws, hand them over, and let me take them away!

The more he thought about it, the more apprehensive Gui became.

At this moment, Martial King coldly said, "Hesitating and sneaky, do you want to die?"

The fierce aura swept over, and Gui felt suffocated.

At this moment, Culture King waved his hand slightly, suppressing the aura, and smiled, "Taishan, don't cause trouble. Why scare the senior?"

Scare the senior...

Gui felt awkward but dared not say anything. He said again, "It's... it's like this. That person... he... he wants Culture King... wants Culture King..."

Seeing his hesitation, Culture King smiled, "Go ahead, what does he want from me? Or does he just want to send a message, cursing us a few times?"

Gui's face changed!

Don't say it, but you hit all three points. Su Yu indeed wants something, wants to ask something, and also wants to curse Martial King!

Culture King... Su Yu...

Countless thoughts flashed through Gui's mind. At this moment, he dared not delay any longer. Feeling shocked, he quickly said, "He wants all of Culture King's rules, fragments of laws, power of laws... He said he wants to enhance his subordinates..."

Culture King looked at him and smiled, "Are you his Heaven Gate connector?"

Gui's eyes flickered, "Yes, but... Culture King also knows that when I disconnect from his Heaven Gate, his Heaven Gate phantom will disappear, so don't think..."

Culture King said calmly, "Don't worry, I have no interest or time for that. If that bastard from Eternal Mountain finds out, it won't be good. The real Heaven Gate can't be opened, and if he projects out... it's trouble for the Myriad Realms! Just know that! Your target isn't big, but I've always been watched!"

Gui secretly breathed a sigh of relief. That's what I thought, otherwise, I'd really be scared.

And beside him, Martial King's eyes widened. Heaven Gate... projection... connector!

Who?

That kid from last time?

No, that kid was still very weak a few days ago. Logically, he hasn't reached the level to connect with a powerful existence through the Heaven Gate.

You have to know, this guy in front of him, even if weak, is still first-class!

Could it be someone else?

For a moment, Martial King couldn't guess, nor did he bother to guess. Too troublesome.

The less you think, the longer you live.

Culture King fell into contemplation, then smiled after a moment, "Alright!"

Alright what?

Gui was still puzzled when Culture King casually tossed a sphere into Gui's hand and chuckled, "Give it to him! Of course, I've set some seals. Don't open it privately. If you want a reward, ask him for it. I can't give you anything now."

Gui was dumbfounded and couldn't help but whisper, "Culture King... do you know Su Yu?"

"I don't."

Culture King smiled, "Do I need to?"

"..."

What kind of talk is that?

Gui was stunned. You don't know him, and then you just handed over the stuff without even asking about the situation. Culture King really asked almost nothing, acting like a fool!

I came to ask, and he just gave it.

Yes, rule fragments, rules of the Great Dao, aren't of much use to people like them, but for those who haven't reached the realm of the ruler of laws, these are treasures.

In fact, even they can use them.

Now, just like that, Culture King handed it over after I mentioned it, without any hesitation.

At this moment, Gui was questioning life.

What's the deal between Culture King and Su Yu?

One firmly believed Culture King would give, and the other actually gave!

Gui wasn't excited, only a chill rose in his heart. The more it was like this, the more he suddenly felt, danger, very dangerous!

He didn't know if it was Culture King who brought this feeling or Su Yu.

These two, communicating across space, even without communication, reached an agreement.

Gui could guarantee that Su Yu couldn't contact Culture King, otherwise, he would have done it himself, no need to find me. And Culture King couldn't contact Su Yu either, otherwise, he would have communicated with Su Yu directly.

Neither could!

Yet at this moment, the two were surprisingly in sync.

You want, I give, even if it's not you personally who came.

Gui held the sphere in his hand. It was sealed by Culture King, and he dared not tamper with it. He didn't know how much power of laws was inside, but he knew one thing, it must be a lot. He vaguely sensed the surging power!

Perhaps... there's even a first-class level rule of the Great Dao!

He was breathing heavily, a first-class level Great Dao!

Is there?

It might exist because Culture King had killed first-class beings!

Gui felt dry-mouthed and whispered, "My lord... aren't you worried I'll take this and leave?"

Culture King smiled, "No, I trust you!"

Gui suddenly felt a chill in his heart!

Trust my ass!

We're not familiar. I just know of you, but I've never dealt with you. What trust?

The more Culture King acted like this, the more worried Gui became.

Culture King smiled again, "Is there anything else?"

"...Yes!"

Gui took a deep breath, "Su Yu also asked me to ask, ask... where is Culture King's lair?"

"At Xingluo Mountain, where else?"

Martial King suddenly interjected, unable to hold back, "You're the Heaven Gate bearer, then you..."

Culture King raised his hand, interrupting Martial King, smiled, looked at Gui, and after a while, asked, "First, let me ask, do you know the current situation of the Human Emperor?"

"Human Emperor?"

Gui hesitated, "Isn't he said to be still battling the powerful figures of the Myriad Races?"

I wouldn't know about that. Culture King pondered for a moment. His lair... does he mean my world? Last time, Su Yu asked if I had opened a world. As for the lair at Xingluo Mountain, Su Yu must know about it. If he didn't, he couldn't have obtained certain things. Does the Human Emperor have any issues?

If Xingyu is fine, then it doesn't matter. But if there's trouble, I'm really worried that in my absence, I'll be set up for a major fall. This is something that's hard to judge.

Has Su Yu made contact with the Human Emperor? It shouldn't be, right? It's too soon! Su Yu hasn't reached that level yet, has he? But he's connected with Gui, which means his Heaven Gate is already quite powerful! Naturally, his strength has also increased significantly.

The key is, this guy connected with Gui and can even manipulate Gui to do his bidding. I have to say, Culture King was a bit surprised. The last time I saw that guy, he had quite a few tricks up his sleeve! Has he succeeded in opening the heavens, hence the significant improvement?

The last time he saw Su Yu, Su Yu was in the process of opening the heavens, comprehending the Life and Death Path. So, he might have truly succeeded!

Thinking of this, he suddenly laughed and said, "The path is under your feet, find it yourself! No one will help you completely, let him figure it out on his own!"

Gui didn't dare to say anything.

Culture King continued, "Anything else?"

"No... nothing else!"

Gui didn't dare to repeat Su Yu's cursing words, fearing that Martial King would kill him.

Culture King laughed, "Nothing else? Just say it, did he curse me or Taishan, and that's it!"

"No... no... you're joking, sir!"

Gui's heart trembled. No, I can't say it.

Culture King laughed, "Then forget it, you can go back. It's not safe to stay here for long. That guy from Eternal Life Mountain is still watching me..."

At this, Culture King paused for a moment and suddenly said, "Tell him not to worry about us, just focus on his own matters! Before the Heaven Gate opens, I'll find a way to deal with the great enemy and prepare for the opening of the Heaven Gate!"

"......"

Such bold words!

Gui's heart was somewhat shaken. Culture King's implication was that he could deal with the one from Eternal Life Mountain before the Heaven Gate opened?

There's still a gap between you and the opponent! Otherwise, you wouldn't have been entangled for so long.

Culture King smiled again and said, "One more thing, tell that guy not to keep connecting with the Heaven Gate every day. It's easy to cause the Heaven Gate to open prematurely... Of course, opening the Heaven Gate is beneficial to you, so do as you please, it's fine if you don't mention it."

Gui felt a bit awkward and quickly said, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare!"

"Go on!"

With a wave of Culture King's hand, Gui disappeared from the spot.

When Gui regained his senses, Culture King and the others were no longer in sight. He was terrified and didn't dare to delay, quickly leaving. He didn't even reunite with his true self. He had to run around until Culture King couldn't track him anymore before reuniting with his true self.

Culture King gave him a very frightening feeling!

...

At the same time.

Martial King's eyes were bright, "Old Wen, were you just talking about that kid from last time? Did your son come looking for you?"

"Shut up!"

Culture King slightly raised his eyebrows, still deep in thought, while Martial King excitedly said, "Why didn't you just capture that guy and then contact that kid? That kid's Heaven Gate can even support a first-class! That means you can draw some of your world's power through that kid. Although not much, drawing first-class world power over would make you stronger than you are now..."

He was very excited!

This is an opportunity!

Culture King, however, slightly shook his head, "What's the rush!"

What's there to be anxious about?

"Let this Gui handle it!"

He smiled, "Our targets are too big, but he... is just right! He has ideas and wants to leave the gate and enter the Myriad Realms. Since he dared to take the risk to find me, it means he's already on the hook!"

No need to exert too much effort, as that might ruin things. A slight mistake could lead to being discovered.

This is just right!

The guys behind the gate, over the years, he actually wanted to subdue some of them. However, because of the war with Eternal Life Mountain, the strong ones behind the gate didn't dare to intervene rashly, which made it difficult for him over the years!

His gaze turned to the distance, where there was an enormous mountain!

Eternally existing!

Even if the world were to be destroyed, it would still exist. That is Eternal Life Mountain, the adversary he has been entangled with for years. Even if he and Martial King joined forces, they couldn't match the opponent.

Of course, that's behind the gate. Outside the gate, he might not fear the opponent.

But here, he can't draw his world's power, so he's still inferior to the opponent.

Now, the Lord of the Undead has also gotten involved. Culture King doesn't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

However, if the guy from Eternal Life Mountain really confronts the Lord of the Undead, he might not gain any advantage.

One thought after another emerged, and he quickly said, "I don't know how many paths that kid has opened. Now he needs the power of laws to nurture his world. Since he's connected with Gui, he might have second or third-class power?"

He's not too sure.

Now, with both sides separated by the Heaven Gate, the pen dao has been messed up by that kid, so he can't sense anything specific.

His gaze once again turned to the distant mountain, standing in the void for countless ages. After a long time, he said, "Wenyu is almost done for!"

Martial King's face changed slightly!

Culture King, however, was indifferent, "So, before she gets into trouble, we must take down that guy! We've wasted too many years here, and that guy is also anxious now. The Heaven Gate is about to open, and I've been blocking him, causing trouble for him... He knows that if I return to the Myriad Realms, my strength will increase, and he's also worried that I'll retaliate against him then, so he wants to deal with me now!"

"Is it about to open?"

Martial King became much more serious, "How much longer?"

"Soon!"

Culture King judged for a moment and then said, "Be careful recently, wait for a while, and see if Su Yu can provide some help..."

"Your son... I think he's quite impressive... maybe there's hope!"

Culture King smiled faintly and said, "It's fine to brag in front of me, but if you really meet him, keep your mouth shut. Do you believe that he's very petty and will find a chance to kill you?"

I don't believe it!

Martial King pouted. Who am I?

Martial King!

I'm so powerful, except for you and the boss, I'm not afraid of anyone!

Culture King chuckled and stopped paying attention.

He turned his head to look in the direction where Gui had left, falling into contemplation. Has Su Yu met with the Human Emperor?

What is the current situation in the Myriad Realms?

There were some things he didn't ask. If he asked too much, he wouldn't know how Su Yu had fooled Gui. It would be meaningless to expose it. As a scholar, Culture King understood this principle.

The less said, the fewer mistakes!

So, when he saw Gui this time, he didn't say much or ask much.

However, at this moment, Culture King was vaguely shaken.

Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, which is not surprising. What slightly shocked him now was that he had already succeeded in opening the heavens and connected with a first-class, which means Su Yu's strength is increasing rapidly, growing day by day!

Can Su Yu provide enough world power before the Heaven Gate opens?

As for where his world is... he didn't elaborate, but Su Yu can definitely find it. Culture King doesn't doubt this. If he can't find it, it means Su Yu is too stupid, a fool, unworthy of discovering his world!

...

It didn't take three days.

This time, Gui was also efficient.

A day later, he contacted Su Yu.

Because this grandson Su Yu was too cunning!

Not only did he close the Heaven Gate, but he was also slowly eroding the imprint he left behind, which made Gui very depressed. He could only arrive early and contact Su Yu again.

"Did you get it?"

The moment the gate opened, Su Yu asked. Gui didn't even have time to speak before Su Yu continued, "What did Culture King say? Did he answer my question?"

"He... he said to find it yourself!"

"Hmm?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "What were his exact words?"

Gui was speechless. The original words were pretty much that. What's the difference?

After thinking for a moment, he still said, "Culture King said, 'The path is under your feet, find it yourself, no one will help you completely...'"

Su Yu's eyes flickered.

The path is under your feet...

One thought after another emerged. Is this Culture King's answer to me?

Aren't you being a bit too cryptic?

Su Yu was speechless!

He rubbed his chin. Culture King is really something, hiding in this place. Forget the Human Emperor, it's hard for anyone to find him.

"Is it the boot on Fat Ball, or another one?"

Su Yu fell into contemplation. It might be the one on Fat Ball!

Culture King is truly impressive.

The path is under your feet... the hint is too obvious. It would be strange if Su Yu couldn't find it!

"So, his boot... could it be the foundational object? You're really something, using this thing as a foundation?"

If that's the case, Su Yu is impressed!

What treasure don't you use, and you use a shoe as a foundation!

Maybe it's not the one on Fat Ball... because Fat Ball has been carrying it around, Culture King wouldn't just throw this thing into Fat Ball's stomach, right?

"Let's look for it and find out!"

Su Yu smiled. Indeed, it's more convenient to ask directly like this. Otherwise, it would be a bit troublesome to find.

The world has been found, Culture King has been contacted, and the Human Emperor's world has been dealt with. So, the purpose of returning to the Myriad Realms this time is almost complete.

Of course, the key is, he's very curious about how much power of laws Culture King has collected over the years.

Soon, he said, "Alright, let's not talk about this. What did Culture King give you?"

"I'll transmit it to you... but... I think it's quite difficult, with many obstacles!"

"Transmit it already!"

Su Yu wasn't too concerned. It's your obstacle, you figure it out. What's it got to do with me?

Gui felt very tired. He suddenly felt like he was a worker!

Working for Su Yu and Culture King!

The two of them communicate across space, and I have to run errands for them!

The more he thought about it, the more aggrieved he felt!

For a moment, he didn't even want to transmit it to Su Yu. He wanted to keep it for himself!

But... he still hoped to enter the Myriad Realms early!

Gui thought to himself, gritting his teeth, "Then let me condense an avatar first!"

"As you wish!"

Seeing him say this, Gui was a bit excited. I can understand the Myriad Realms in advance!

Soon, he began to condense his avatar.

Su Yu waved his hand, and where his willpower imprint lay, a world took shape. In the next moment, he reached out and a Lantian avatar appeared. Su Yu communicated with it for a while, and the Lantian avatar broke into a smile—how interesting!

In an instant, Lantian vanished.

The area where Gui resided suddenly became much more populated.

Su Yu chuckled, "I think Gui will be quite pleased. He will surely return with a full harvest!"
