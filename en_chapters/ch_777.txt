Chapter 777: March and Giant Axe (Requesting Subscriptions)

"Heh, women!"

At this moment, Su Yu flew far away, shaking his head with a smile. See, how easily things can be resolved.

He had indeed heard the last words of the Culture King, who had instructed him to revive Xingyue. Su Yu was curious—was it out of affection, or was Xingyue actually a backup plan? Whatever it was, it didn't matter to him. Su Yu had already planned to revive Xingyue, so whether the Culture King mentioned it or not made no difference.

...

Inside the research institute.

Su Yu quickly arrived. At this moment, Hetu was being dissected! Yes, the students of the Culture King were curiously dissecting him. Su Yu now knew the name of the female necromancer—Li Yun, one of the outstanding disciples of the Culture King back in the day.

Currently, Li Yun was leading several other necromancers in studying Hetu. Seeing Su Yu arrive, Li Yun asked curiously, "Does the Human Emperor really intend to resurrect him?"

Su Yu noticed Hetu casting a pleading look his way and couldn't help but chuckle. "That's the plan. Have you discovered anything?"

"Death to life..."

Li Yun pondered for a moment before saying, "This is different from when the Human Emperor was reborn. Previously, you were merely transitioning between life and death within your own world. But they are actually governed by the Death Path! This is akin to seizing control from the Death Path... and the Death Path is quite domineering and solitary!"

Solitary!

That was Li Yun's description. Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded.

"Indeed, very solitary!"

The master of the Death Path was one who believed in the supremacy of their own path. The Death Path was the only path, and no branches were allowed. Even the Ink Path was forcibly opened by the Culture King.

Such an existence had a high degree of control over necromancers. By reviving necromancers, Su Yu was essentially trying to take food from the mouth of the master of the Death Path.

Li Yun solemnly reminded, "Human Emperor, if you wish to revive them, be cautious. I suspect the Death Path might be triggered."

"Triggered?"

Su Yu frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Revival!"

She explained, "Currently, both the Time Path and the Death Path seem to be in a dormant or passive state. However, once you touch the bottom line, the path might awaken!"

Su Yu's heart trembled.

No way!

The Death Path was terrifyingly powerful, capable of opening a realm. If it were to awaken... that would be a huge problem.

Are you trying to scare me?

Li Yun continued, "Of course, even if it awakens, I don't think there will be much commotion. After all, the master of the Death Path might be dead or completely vanished. Without a master, the path only possesses passive power!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Even if passive, it might still be terrifying. This added to Su Yu's concerns, making the revival even more challenging.

At this moment, Li Yun cut into Hetu again, pondering for a moment. "Hetu is indeed different from us. Let's put it this way: our core is essentially death energy. If our death energy turns into life energy, we might completely die. As for him, he has a physical body!"

As she spoke, she extracted Hetu's pitch-black heart. "A black heart!"

"......"

Hetu was depressed. You're the one with a black heart. I'm a necromancer; of course, my heart is black.

Should it be red?

Speechless!

"His heart is intact! It hasn't decayed, which is quite miraculous!"

Li Yun said, then added, "Also, can we cut this one too?"

She pointed at Liu Hong.

Liu Hong's face turned unsightly.

Su Yu was curious. Li Yun explained, "He's a half-necromancer. I think cutting him might yield a different result. What is the mindset of a half-necromancer? What is the form of a necromancer? And what about a necromancer like Hetu with a physical body... We need a comparison to avoid errors during revival!"

Professional indeed!

Su Yu nodded. As expected, professionals are different.

Su Yu had initially planned to try a method, but from Li Yun's words, it seemed they needed to separate and analyze.

Su Yu looked at Liu Hong, whose face was gloomy. I refuse!

You're also a half-necromancer...

Su Yu cleared his throat. "Teacher Liu, I'm no longer a half-necromancer. I'm alive now. Alas, it's sad. No one can convert me anymore. Otherwise, I'd try it myself!"

Yes, with the death energy channel severed, Su Yu was considered alive again.

Now, he was no longer a half-necromancer.

Liu Hong grew even more depressed. Su Yu smiled, "Teacher Liu, you're already at the Daofuse Realm. It's just cutting open the body; it's no big deal."

"......"

Easy for you to say. Why don't you try it?

He said nonchalantly, "Don't we need to study a living person too? For comparison..."

Li Yun said strangely, "Living person? It's not like we haven't been alive before. We've studied plenty of living people. The data is in our minds, and our memories have been revived. Why do we need a living person?"

"......"

Exhausted.

Liu Hong was helpless. It seemed there was no chance of getting Su Yu to try it himself.

And Su Yu, squinting his eyes, looked at him with a bright smile.

Liu Hong's heart skipped a beat. Forget it, this guy holds grudges. Since there's no hope, I won't show it. He quickly smiled, "Alright, for the great cause of revival, I must support it!"

Soon, Liu Hong lay down on the research table, feeling sorrowful.

But there was no choice!

Li Yun and the others were not polite, directly cutting him open!

After all, they were all strong at the Daofuse Realm. No matter how they were tossed around, it was hard to die.

Su Yu was a bit curious, leaning in to watch for a while. Liu Hong's face was unsightly. Forget it, he closed his eyes, not watching anymore!

Li Yun cut while analyzing with the other necromancers.

Su Yu also stepped forward to investigate, sensing whether Liu Hong's state differed from when he was a half-necromancer.

After examining for a while, Su Yu frowned slightly. "Teacher Liu's power composition is more balanced than mine was, truly a mix of life and death!"

Thinking of this, Su Yu's eyes flickered.

He knew a technique, the Yuan Aperture Reversal Method!

Transforming life energy into death energy, and reversing death energy into life energy.

This was just a special technique, not a rule of the Great Dao. Su Yu had tried to transform it into a rule before, but it didn't work. Even divine characters couldn't be transformed; it could only be used as a special technique.

Thinking of this, Su Yu said in a deep voice, "I know the Yuan Aperture Reversal Method. If I reverse 360 yuan apertures, I can transform life energy into death energy. Is this technique useful?"

Upon hearing this, Li Yun fell into contemplation.

After a moment, the necromancers pondered, and Li Yun asked, "Can the Human Emperor still reverse it now?"

To be honest, Su Yu hadn't used this technique in a long time.

At this moment, his yuan apertures had transformed into the Heaven Gate, and he wasn't sure if he could still use it.

Thinking of this, Su Yu tried reversing it. As he did, the Heaven Gate appeared, and suddenly, a surge of death energy gushed out from the Heaven Gate.

Su Yu was slightly pleased and nodded. It could still be used.

However, at that moment, a strong surge of life energy burst out from the Heaven Gate, instantly shattering the death energy!

Su Yu was shocked!

He quickly manifested the Heaven Gate. At this moment, the Heaven Gate was brimming with life energy, rapidly dispersing the death energy.

Su Yu's eyes flickered with uncertainty. The next moment, he called out, "Tongtian!"

Moments later, a figure appeared.

Marquis Tongtian looked puzzled. "What's the matter?"

Why call me suddenly?

Strange!

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Look!"

Marquis Tongtian then looked at the Heaven Gate. Upon seeing it, he was slightly moved and quickly understood Su Yu's purpose for summoning him. After thinking for a moment, he hesitated and said, "This... Heaven Gate... Did Your Majesty use death energy inside the Heaven Gate?"

Su Yu nodded, speaking in a deep voice, "It was fine before. I had the Heaven Gate before and used death energy, and everything was normal! Today, when I used the reversal method again, reversing life to death, it was shattered by the Heaven Gate!"

Marquis Tongtian fell into contemplation, and after a long time, he said, "This... It's hard to say! Perhaps it didn't touch the Heaven Gate before..."

"Nonsense!"

Su Yu frowned. "I used to manifest the Heaven Gate and often absorbed death energy!"

Marquis Tongtian was also troubled. After hesitating for a moment, he said, "Perhaps it's different now. The biggest difference is that Your Majesty shattered the Heaven Gate before and later reassembled it!"

Su Yu said nothing.

Was there any difference during this period?

Marquis Tongtian continued, "So, I speculate that perhaps after Your Majesty shattered it once, it made the Heaven Gate more active, or perhaps it was noticed by the Gate Clan!"

Su Yu frowned. What does that mean?

What do you mean by being noticed by the Gate Clan?

Was I noticed by the Heaven Gate?

Marquis Tongtian continued, "It's like this: the Heaven Gate... The existence of the Heaven Gate sealed the Era of Opening the Heavens, and it's generally believed that it was sealed by either the master of the Death Path or the Human Ancestor!"

"Could it be that the Human Ancestor sealed it, along with the master of the Death Path?"

He added, "It's very possible. Those who open the Heaven Gate, as far as I know, seem to be all humans. It's said that the myriad races can open it... but I've never seen it!"

He looked at Su Yu. "So I think, could it be that the Human Ancestor sealed the master of the Death Path, and now the Heaven Gate is triggered, perhaps thinking that the master of the Death Path wants to come out?"

"Or that the necromancers want to rescue the master of the Death Path? To unseal him?"

"......"

One speculation after another was voiced, and Su Yu frowned. It was indeed possible.

Was the Heaven Gate created by the Human Ancestor?

Or was it found by the Human Ancestor from the world, sealing the Era of Opening the Heavens by humans?

The Human Ancestor's physical body path was very strong, Su Yu knew that.

But... unless the Human Ancestor also opened the heavens independently, the physical body path was just the path used in the past.

One thought after another flashed through his mind.

Soon, Su Yu took a deep breath and stopped thinking about it. The more he thought, the more complicated it became.

He quickly said, "So, now my Heaven Gate can't touch death energy. No, if there's too much death energy, it will be automatically shattered and transformed into life energy!"

Su Yu's eyes lit up. "This... might be a good thing!"

Indeed, when death energy touches the Heaven Gate, it gets transformed into life energy.

This... Su Yu really didn't know this before.

If that's the case, he suddenly looked at Hetu. Hetu, seeing his gaze, immediately bared his teeth. I'm going to be a guinea pig again, aren't I?

Just say it directly!

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "Hetu, death energy transforming into life energy, huh!"

Good Fortune!

Hetu sighed helplessly and had no choice but to release a bit of death aura. Su Yu quickly manifested the Heaven Gate, and indeed, this time it was different from before. As the death aura surged forth, it was instantly transformed into life force.

With a loud bang, this life force immediately returned to Hetu's body, causing him to groan. Being a spirit of death, this life force was actually harmful to him. He suffered a minor setback from this.

However, Su Yu's eyes brightened. The life force coursed through his body, and it took quite some time before the death aura managed to suppress it. The more Su Yu thought about it, the more excited he became. Perhaps this could lead to a better method and assurance for transforming into a spirit of death.

...

Several spirits of death continued their research. The gap between half-dead spirits and full spirits of death was still significant. The former retained their physical bodies, with life and death auras coexisting. In contrast, spirits of death naturally lacked life force. Finding a way for life and death auras to coexist might be the key to resurrection.

The group delved deeper into their research. As for external matters, none of them, including Su Yu, were inclined to bother unless the spirits sealed away broke free. For now, there was nothing urgent that required their attention.

...

Meanwhile, as Su Yu researched resurrection, in the Upper Realm, the Chaos Mountain region was in turmoil. The myriad races had begun their formal advance into Chaos Mountain. On the outskirts, vanguard forces from various races were already sweeping through.

Teams of powerful beings began their march toward Chaos Mountain. The myriad races used Ren Mountain as their base, gathering a large number of strong individuals. At the peak of Ren Mountain, a group of Heavenly Sovereigns convened.

At this moment, Moon Heavenly Sovereign was briefing everyone on the situation, his expression somewhat grave. "According to our current investigations, in the Chaos Mountain region, there are likely no fewer than eighty Daofuse Realm Chaos Ancient Beasts! Previously, they acted independently, only gathering when outsiders intruded, as their intelligence is not high!"

"But ever since the last upheaval, two terrifying entities have emerged deep within Chaos Mountain: an Eight-Winged Tiger and a Tailless Dragon!"

"The Eight-Winged Tiger definitely possesses the combat strength of a Heavenly Sovereign, and the Tailless Dragon, as far as I know, is injured, possibly having fought with a terrifying entity deep within the chaos. Even so, it still possesses Heavenly Sovereign-level combat strength. In its prime, it might be... beyond imagination, comparable to the ancestor of the Control King's lineage!"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign spoke softly, "Has the identity of the ancestor from the Control King's lineage been clarified yet?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign shook his head, "It's hard to determine. The Control King seemed to have no descendants back then, but if there are none... where did these people come from? It's possible they are secret descendants, and this so-called ancestor is likely a direct bloodline of the Control King!"

Continuing, Moon Heavenly Sovereign said, "Back to the matter of Chaos Mountain. Now, the Tailless Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger each occupy a region, one in the south and the other in the north... both deep within Chaos Mountain, each gathering dozens of Daofuse Realm and over a hundred Eternal Ancient Beasts!"

The crowd felt a slight chill. Thunderstorm, who hadn't gone out to investigate, said in a deep voice, "They've gathered?"

"Yes, they have gathered!" Moon Heavenly Sovereign sighed, "The last great battle ended because of the sudden appearance of these two! Otherwise, we had a chance to capture Yue Hao!"

He continued, "Additionally, according to our investigations, besides the terrifying entity behind the gate, the strongest in the Control King's lineage is that ancestor. There are also five Heavenly Sovereign-level beings, including Yue Hao, and over ten Heavenly Kings!"

"If not for Su Yu's group killing several Heavenly Kings and a Heavenly Sovereign previously, their strength would be even greater!"

The more they discussed, the more frustrated they became. When you think there are no enemies outside, they turn out to be more numerous and stronger than you imagined, leaving you no choice but to feel frustrated.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign continued, "Among these Heavenly Sovereigns, Moon Luo is extremely powerful. Last time, he fought Giant Axe, and everyone saw it. Giant Axe was no match, and within thirty rounds, he was severely injured and fled! Moon Luo's strength, even if slightly weaker than that ancestor, is still stronger than us, probably comparable to Sun Corona!"

Sun Corona nodded slightly, "Probably not weaker than me. Being able to seal Hundred Battle is indeed formidable!"

Although the myriad races have more Heavenly Sovereigns, the opponent's strength is not weak either. Adding the terrifying entity behind the gate, the strength gap between the two sides is not large.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign added, "Currently, there are three... no, including the missing Hundred Battle, there are four wandering Heavenly Sovereigns!"

"This is also a significant variable!"

The Tailless Dragon, Hundred Battle, Eight-Winged Tiger, and Giant Axe! Four Heavenly Sovereigns with unclear positions and whereabouts. The strength of Hundred Battle and the Tailless Dragon might even surpass Heavenly Sovereigns, reaching the level of true ancient Human Kings with physical bodies.

This makes them even more daunting!

Moon Heavenly Sovereign briefly explained the situation and said solemnly, "Therefore, at this point, how to defeat the Chaos lineage is a major problem! These wandering Heavenly Sovereigns, especially the two ancient beasts, are troublesome. I'm worried they might ally with the Control King's lineage!"

Everyone exchanged glances, feeling a bit of a headache. There are quite a few of them! Not just one or two, but four top-tier entities with unclear attitudes.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign continued, "Giant Axe owes Su Yu a favor and is currently targeting the Control King's lineage. However, to be honest, Giant Axe's strength is at the bottom among Heavenly Sovereigns! He has gained almost nothing by facing the Control King's lineage alone!"

"Brother March!" Moon Heavenly Sovereign looked at March and said solemnly, "Brother March, can you contact Giant Axe and have him act with us? The Human Race indeed has grudges with us, but the Control King's lineage is both a traitor to the Human Race and an enemy of Su Yu's group. If Giant Axe truly wants to repay a favor... he might as well join forces with us, perhaps achieving greater results!"

March wore a simple expression, "I can't contact him." Who would believe that? It was March who insisted on releasing Giant Axe, so how could he have no contact with him at all?

"Another issue, where did Hundred Battle go?" Moon Heavenly Sovereign said solemnly, "Not just Hundred Battle, last time Nanxi, Jiang Hai, and Yunshui escaped, and now they're missing too. Did they go to find Hundred Battle? If they did, where are they hiding now? Su Yu and his group can ascend from the lower realm, so they can descend too. Yunshui and his group previously followed Su Yu, do they know where the lower realm passage is?"

Excluding the passage of the Fate Clan!

Moon Heavenly Sovereign said solemnly, "If Hundred Battle took them to the lower realm, will there be a change during this time?"

"Su Yu's side did suffer significant losses! But on Su Yu's side, if I remember correctly, there's still a dog, the one belonging to the Culture King, still alive. It fought Yue Hao before and held its ground!"

"So this dog, Su Yu, Hundred Battle... if these people form an alliance in the lower realm, it's also a major problem!"

"They're all forces of the Human Race..."

The more they discussed, the more depressed they became. It's not easy! Now, if they fight the Control King's lineage to the end, how many Heavenly Sovereigns will be lost? How many will die? The key is that there are still many wandering Heavenly Sovereigns.

Dao Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly, "But now, we have no choice but to fight! Otherwise, if we drag it out, there might be changes! Sun Corona knows the situation, the Gate of Hell might open! Once it opens, there's a terrifying entity inside! Who is this entity? Is she a top-tier powerhouse of the Control King's lineage? Why is she trapped behind the gate? Did she go there voluntarily or was she forced? What is the purpose of the Control King's lineage? To open the Gate of Hell?"

Dao Heavenly Sovereign said heavily, "Therefore, no matter what, we need to resolve the trouble of the Control King's lineage as soon as possible! Also, the Human Emperor and others might return. Su Yu has no reason to deceive us... but after they return, will the Rule Masters of the myriad races have the advantage, or will the Human Emperor and his group have the advantage? It's hard to say!"

Continuing, Dao Heavenly Sovereign said in a low voice, "The last thing... is about us! We are now so-called Heavenly Sovereigns, but Heavenly Sovereigns are not Rule Masters! When the strong of various races return, how will we position ourselves? What will we become in the future? Will we still be ancient marquises, following orders?"

"At this stage, we need to strive to become Rule Masters!"

"Break the seal and advance, so that even if everyone returns, whether the Human Emperor has the advantage or our people do, we will have the power to contend!"

The myriad races have many Heavenly Sovereigns, and if they all become Rule Masters, they will form a formidable force!

March was somewhat impatient, "Alright, the immediate priority is the trouble of the Control King's lineage! If we don't resolve this lineage, something big will happen sooner or later! Look, this lineage is now extremely relaxed. If the Human Emperor and others haven't returned yet, and the Gate of Hell opens first... we'll all be in trouble! Who knows what the situation will be later? We need to break their claws first to have hope of facing future troubles..."

Everyone was helpless. The more they thought about it, the more helpless they felt! Previously, they thought they were invincible, but now... damn, there are strong enemies everywhere!

Hundred Battle and Su Yu's side aren't weak either.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign continued, "Hundred Battle and Su Yu might both be in the lower realm, so let's not worry about them for now. However, the Tailless Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger must be dealt with. They're on the battlefield, and we can't ignore two Heavenly Sovereigns leading seventy to eighty Daofuse Realm beings, can we?"

No one could ignore this force!

Moon Heavenly Sovereign continued, "Moreover, I'm really worried that these Chaos Ancient Beasts might ally with the Control King's lineage because it's very likely. The Gate of Hell was rumored to have been used to seal the Chaos Ancient Beasts back then!"

Everyone grew serious again.

Moon Heavenly Sovereign looked at the crowd, "So now we need someone to approach these two sides, to win over the two ancient beasts, or at least to ascertain their stance!"

"In addition, there's another matter: finding the entrance to the lower realm!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign said gravely, "We must find it. We can't place the safety of the myriad races on the assumption that Su Yu and Hundred Battle won't dare to act! In the lower realm, there are only a few like Tiangu! Such strength cannot match Hundred Battle and his group!"

The crowd fell silent once more.

Moon Heavenly Venerable suddenly spoke in a soft tone, "March, you'll be responsible for venturing to the Lower Realm! Find the entrance to the Lower Realm! I'll go seek the Tailless Dragon, and Destiny will look for the Eight-Winged Tiger!"

March grumbled, "How am I supposed to find it?" He cursed silently in his heart. This was ill-intentioned!

Moon Heavenly Venerable chuckled, "Give it a try! If it doesn't work, you can search with Thunderstorm!"

Thunderstorm frowned slightly.

Moon Heavenly Venerable continued softly, "The two of you should search together. I believe you can find it! Once you do, you can descend to the Lower Realm. We only need to agree on one thing: we won't actively invade the Lower Realm, and before the entrance opens, we won't trouble Hundred Battle and his people... However, they need to send Tiangu and the others up!"

"What do you two think?"

He allowed the two Heavenly Venerables to leave, but only on the condition that it was just the two of them; no other strong members of their races were allowed to go! If they didn't return... well, they could wait to be cannon fodder!

At this moment, they were worried about the Lower Realm on one hand, and on the other, they were eager to engage in battle with the Chaos lineage to prevent the entities behind the Gate of Hell from emerging! There were many troubles!

Knowing that March, Thunderstorm, and the humans of the Lower Realm were connected, they still chose to let them go down and make contact. Perhaps these two knew how to reach the Lower Realm!

Moon Heavenly Venerable smiled faintly, "If it still doesn't work... we can join forces to forcibly open a passage to the Destiny Realm to help you descend. Of course, there will be some danger then... but we have no other choice now!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable sighed, "The safety of the Lower Realm is entirely dependent on the humans... Do you all think this is appropriate?"

Of course, it wasn't appropriate! If the Lower Realm could be opened now, they would all descend together and eliminate Hundred Battle and Su Yu, without a doubt!

The various races of the Lower Realm were teeming with countless living beings, and they were the foundation and stronghold of their power. How many people were there in the Upper Realm? Most of the Daofuse Realm experts in the Upper Realm were born in the Lower Realm. The rules of the Upper Realm weren't perfect, and the Daofuse Realm experts discovered now were all pseudo-Daofuse. Who could be at ease?

March remained silent, while Thunderstorm grumbled, "I don't know where the passage to the Lower Realm is!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable laughed lightly, "How could that be? If Hundred Battle really went down, would Brother Thunderstorm not know?"

Thunderstorm replied coldly, "What do you mean by that?"

"What do I mean? Doesn't Brother Thunderstorm know in his heart?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable said calmly, "Why speak so plainly? Wouldn't that make everyone uncomfortable? As we've said, peace is precious now! The Chaos Race is our common enemy, isn't it? This lineage suddenly appeared after lying dormant for many years, and the strength they've shown so far may not be all they have... Aren't you worried? When the sandpiper and the clam fight, the fisherman benefits, but only if the sandpiper and clam are strong enough! Be careful not to become someone else's meal!"

He looked again at the two powerful figures, "You two, the matter of the Lower Realm is in your hands, alright?"

March remained silent.

Thunderstorm looked at March, who grinned foolishly, "Why are you looking at me, Brother Thunderstorm? I'm neither Hundred Battle's father-in-law nor his brother-in-law... What use is there in looking at me?"

Thunderstorm frowned.

March added, "Of course, if Brother Thunderstorm is willing to take the lead, I'll accompany him!"

Thunderstorm cursed silently! Damn you! If you weren't colluding with Su Yu's side, I wouldn't believe it!

Moon Heavenly Venerable laughed at this, "So, Brother March agrees? What about Brother Thunderstorm?"

Thunderstorm frowned, and after a long pause, he said, "I'll follow March! But I think we are too few in number to find the passage. How about letting Giant Bamboo and Lei Lie accompany us?"

Moon Heavenly Venerable smiled faintly, "That's not appropriate. Why trouble them? If it really doesn't work, I'll let Marquis Yuan Sheng and a few others accompany you!"

"......"

Alright.

Thunderstorm was just testing the waters, and it proved to be unfeasible! Clearly, the Giant Race and the Iron Devourer Race had now become tools for the myriad races to restrain them. Gathering at Ren Mountain was another form of control. Previously, they could secretly withdraw, but now, there's no chance! Everyone was at Ren Mountain, and there were too many powerful beings present. Anyone wanting to leave needed the consent of several Heavenly Venerables.

After a while, both sides reached an agreement. March and Thunderstorm would find a way to descend to the Lower Realm. They didn't expect much from the humans, only hoping to bring up a group of strong individuals. Especially a few, like Tiangu, who might now be Heavenly Kings, or perhaps... Heavenly Venerables? Who knows!

On the side of the God Race, Moon Heavenly Venerable specifically instructed to notify the former Empress to ascend. She must ascend. The former Empress was very powerful, though her current state wasn't good. However, even in a poor state, ascending might allow her to fight one last battle. The exact strength of the former Empress wasn't clear to the God Race.

These people firmly believed that the two could descend to the Lower Realm!

...

After Thunderstorm and March left, Desolate Heavenly Venerable said coldly, "Those two are definitely colluding with the humans!"

It's obvious!

Dao Heavenly Venerable chuckled, "Colluding is colluding! I'm more curious about how Su Yu and Hundred Battle coexist? We've all heard a bit about Su Yu from the Heavenly Dragon Marquis. He's a domineering character, unwilling to be subordinate! And Hundred Battle is the same! March didn't choose to help Hundred Battle in the last tide, but in this tide, he has some collusion with Su Yu... So, is March helping Su Yu or Hundred Battle? It's interesting that they're descending together!"

"The internal strife among humans isn't new. Maybe we don't need to do anything; they'll fight among themselves in the Lower Realm!"

"As the protagonists from ancient times to now, the humans have an incredibly prosperous destiny, producing strong individuals one after another. Without internal strife, there might not be anything for us to do!"

Dao Heavenly Venerable sighed, "Hundred Battle, Su Yu, and the Control King's lineage, all three are human factions. If they truly joined forces, especially at the end of the last tide, with Hundred Battle and the Control King's lineage joining hands, there might be nothing left for us!"

He laughed, "So, humans being too strong isn't necessarily a bad thing! Now, with the three human factions standing strong, it gives us an opportunity! There's no need for us to be discontent. Humans suppressed us for over a hundred thousand years, and we've only suppressed them for six thousand years. If anyone should be discontent, it shouldn't be us!"

Everyone nodded slightly. Indeed. The overlords are still the humans. The myriad races have ruled for six thousand years, which is already quite good! In ancient times, even with so many rulers of laws among the myriad races, they were still suppressed by the humans! If the Culture King and others hadn't left, the later events wouldn't have happened.

Dao Heavenly Venerable continued with a smile, "The urgent task is actually to break the seal and become rulers of laws! Yes, there are many human experts, but they've all reached their limits! Take the Control King's lineage's old ancestor and Hundred Battle, one follows the Chaos Dao, the other the physical Dao. Breaking the seal won't enhance their strength!"

"Su Yu's dog hasn't reached the Heavenly Venerable level, so breaking the seal won't help either!"

"But for us, once the seal is broken, we'll instantly have over ten rulers of laws, and our strength will soar!"

Dao Heavenly Venerable chuckled, "The Control King's lineage has five Heavenly Venerables, and currently, three of them follow the Chaos Dao. Breaking the seal won't help them! So, in this Myriad Realms, we're the only ones truly eager to break the seal!"

Everyone nodded again.

Dao Heavenly Venerable added, "Breaking the seal and exterminating the humans... I think it's very difficult! But finding a way to break the seal is better. Last time, when Su Yu and his people met with us, what they said might not be entirely true, but there's some hope!"

"Whether it's the Martial Emperor or King Yue's corpse, it's worth a try!"

Everyone nodded silently. This matter should be prioritized.

Moon Heavenly Venerable quickly said, "Then Destiny and I will go test the attitudes of the two ancient beasts! If we can find the passage to the Lower Realm, great. If not... when necessary, we can forcefully break it open!"

The punitive force in the passage is much weaker now than it was back then! This is also an opportunity to break it open by force!

After some discussion, everyone dispersed.

They still needed to fight the Chaos lineage, but only if there wouldn't be any unexpected changes.

...

At this moment, as March and Thunderstorm walked away, they didn't speak.

After a while, Thunderstorm said in a low voice, "Brother March, the humans and the Iron Devourer Race have been allied for many years, haven't they?"

March grinned foolishly, "I suppose so!"

"Hundred Battle..."

Thunderstorm was about to say something when March chuckled, "Not very familiar. I haven't had much contact with Hundred Battle. I only know that my Seventh Month was tricked to death by him!"

"......"

Thunderstorm sighed!

While sighing, he still asked, "But you've seen Su Yu's situation! Do you think he still has the ability to turn the tables? He's a bit too impulsive. That last battle could have been avoided!"

March remained silent.

Marquis Giant Bamboo had told him that Su Yu might not have suffered any losses, but he had seen everything that happened last time. The Lower Realm... might also be an opportunity.

He wanted to find Su Yu and see if Su Yu still had any cards left. If not, with just Su Yu and Fat Ball, he needed to consider the future of the Iron Devourer Race!

With Hundred Battle, there was the enmity of Seventh Month being killed, even if Hundred Battle wasn't the killer, he couldn't accept Hundred Battle's ideology.

As for the Control King's lineage, forget it. His father was killed by the Control King.

The myriad races were now convinced they were colluding with the humans.

Among the three human factions, he could only pin his hopes on Su Yu, hoping Su Yu could bring some surprises.

"Thunderstorm, you go ahead. I'll look for the passage to the Lower Realm!"

March left alone. He still needed to find Giant Axe and bring along General Xuelan, who was previously frozen. As for his own people, there was no hope of taking them, but taking humans wasn't a problem. Now, everyone was eager for the humans to leave and stop causing trouble!

If Giant Axe and Xuelan had the chance to submit to Su Yu, Su Yu could quickly gather a few strong individuals. In that case, there would still be some hope.

Including himself, Giant Axe, and Fat Ball, three Heavenly Venerable-level beings, if Su Yu could also reach the Heavenly Venerable level, four Heavenly Venerables would form a formidable force!

"Hope everyone is safe, and that Su Yu can still preserve some strength..."

March wasn't in the best of moods, and all he could do was hope for the best. As for the passage to the lower realm, he knew exactly where it was. Whether Thunderstorm knew or not was none of his concern. He had no intention of traveling with Thunderstorm. He preferred to act alone.

Soon, March found the still-frozen Xuelan. Without bothering to unseal her, he simply collected her and swiftly left Ren Mountain.

...

Not long after leaving Ren Mountain, near Chaos Mountain, Marquis Giant Axe appeared, looking around cautiously. In a low voice, he called out, "March?"

March soon materialized. Giant Axe carefully scanned the surroundings, then relaxed and cursed, "That woman Moon Luo is no weakling! Ugly but powerful! Last time we fought, I didn't come away unscathed!"

He sighed, recalling the severe beating he had received. Indeed, exposing someone's flaws was a sure way to make enemies. Moon Luo had gone berserk last time, nearly blowing him to pieces.

March chuckled, "Brother Giant Axe, you sure have guts!"

"Can't help it when you're not strong enough," Giant Axe laughed as well. "What brings you to me, Brother March?"

"I want to visit the lower realm," March said seriously. "Last time, Su Yu was defeated, and the current situation is unclear. Hundred Battle might have descended to the lower realm. Two tigers can't share one mountain! Yunshui and others chose to betray Su Yu and continue following Hundred Battle... I was thinking, last time Su Yu saved your life. If Hundred Battle suppresses Su Yu this time... maybe you'll need to mediate."

Giant Axe frowned slightly. "Would Hundred Battle really do that?"

"Who knows!" March replied with a smile. "Would you be willing to make the trip, Brother Giant Axe? If the situation in the lower realm is unclear, would you be willing to lend Su Yu a hand?"

Giant Axe frowned, "If Su Yu is truly weak and can't resist... I suggest he just retire peacefully. Although Hundred Battle is unreliable, he's powerful. Of course, if Hundred Battle really intends to kill Su Yu, I'll intervene. I won't let Hundred Battle do as he pleases!"

"And if Su Yu's side isn't weak?" March looked at Giant Axe, who replied solemnly, "Not weak? His forces were wiped out last time! Even if you help him, along with the Iron Devourer Race... does he have the strength to resist?"

This wasn't just about dealing with Hundred Battle; it was a matter for the entire Human Race. The key was that the external enemies were formidable!

March smiled, "If they're not weak, would you be willing to help, Brother Giant Axe?"

Giant Axe scratched his head, "I'll have to see the situation. First and foremost, the interests of the Human Race must come first! If Su Yu insists on competing with Hundred Battle but the gap in strength is too large, I'll protect his life... If Hundred Battle wants to kill him, I'll definitely step in! But... if the gap is too large, I can't fight Hundred Battle to the death for him, right? That would weaken the overall strength of the Human Race!"

March nodded, "Then... what kind of strength would you consider not weak?"

"At the very least, Su Yu himself must have the strength of a Heavenly King, right?" Giant Axe said awkwardly. "I heard he blew up his pen dao... Ahem, he might have fallen to the Sunmoon Realm... At the very least, he needs to be at the top of the Daofuse Realm, right? If not... Daofuse! Yes, regaining Daofuse combat strength would work too! As for his subordinates, besides that dog, it seems he doesn't have anyone else. Without ten or twenty Daofuse experts, plus three to five Heavenly Kings, there's... there's no way to compete!"

Even with the Iron Devourer Race, that strength wasn't enough, but at least there was hope. If they were too weak, Giant Axe... really couldn't help!

March calculated. Su Yu himself recovering shouldn't be a problem. But three to five Heavenly Kings... he wasn't sure.

After some hesitation, March said seriously, "Alright, if Su Yu himself recovers his strength and there are three living Heavenly Kings, including Fat Ball, would you be willing to help, Brother Giant Axe? If they don't have that strength, you don't need to say it; I wouldn't want my entire race to go to their deaths either!"

Giant Axe pondered for a while, gritted his teeth, and nodded, "If there are truly three Heavenly Kings... including Fat Ball, with you, Fat Ball, and me, that makes three Heavenly Sovereigns. Add two more Heavenly Kings, and that strength... could contend a bit! He saved my life, and I didn't manage to kill Yue Hao and the others, so I'll repay the favor!"

The key was, could three survive? Rumor had it they were all gone!

But March thought, Hongmeng was still alive! Fat Ball was alive too! And, Giant Axe didn't mention the dead. As far as March knew, the South King had also joined Su Yu. There you go, three Heavenly Kings!

Alright! With that, Giant Axe could be roped in!

In this way, the strength wasn't weak!

Giant Axe didn't think too much. With him, March, and Fat Ball, the three of them could roughly contend with Hundred Battle. If Su Yu's side had a few more Heavenly Kings, they would be stronger than Hundred Battle's side. Helping Su Yu seemed reasonable!

Maybe he could even mediate between them! Giant Axe thought to himself, yes, mediate between them!

March silently thought, a silly grin on his face, while Giant Axe, lost in thought, also wore a silly grin. At this moment, neither knew who was truly silly and who was pretending!
