Chapter 707: Returning to Old Practices

After a long period of investigation, Su Yu and the Great Ming King unearthed a section of the mountain. Halfway up, they found a sealed pit, so well-concealed that it was almost impossible to tell it had ever been excavated.

The two of them crawled inside and soon reached the core area of the mountain, where they finally saw a faint light. It came from a small piece of jade, emitting a gentle glow. The entire mountain's shielding power emanated from this core.

Just as Su Yu was about to approach, the Great Ming King extended a hand to stop him. After a careful examination, he whispered, "Don't touch this. It's the foundation of the formation's core. I understand now why the Control King's lineage didn't dismantle this formation."

"Why not?" Su Yu asked.

The Great Ming King chuckled, "This lineage must be conducting experiments here. This jade is the core of the mountain's source vein! Simply put, it's the foundation of this mountain. If you remove it, the mountain might collapse, causing a huge commotion!"

"A mountain collapsing would indeed cause a significant disturbance, potentially leading to trouble and unforeseen changes. So, they left it alone, knowing few could detect the formation's presence."

"If you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have noticed," Su Yu admitted.

The Great Ming King explained a few things, emphasizing that each field has its specialists. Su Yu, being an outsider to the arts of divine symbols, formations, and alchemy, couldn't possibly master them all. He was skilled in weapon forging, but this formation was beyond his expertise.

He could discern that the jade was the core source of the entire formation. "So, the formation's core is based on this mountain, not some external treasure?"

"Exactly!" The Great Ming King nodded. "It's quite a clever method! This mountain has stood for many years without being destroyed, making it a treasure in itself! This jade should actually be called 'jade essence,' serving as the natural foundation for the formation."

The Great Ming King marveled, "The Control King's lineage must be exceptionally skilled in formations! If so, they can establish large-scale shielding formations without much cost!"

Su Yu nodded, acknowledging the impressive methods of this lineage.

Su Yu pondered, "Can we shrink this formation? Make it small enough to carry with us, to shield against the suppression of chaotic rules? Otherwise, fighting here is possible, but it would soon attract the mountain's rejection, leading ancient beasts to attack."

In battle, you might not notice the suppression of chaotic rules, but if the fight drags on, the entire Chaos Mountain will reject you, leading to certain death. A large number of ancient beasts would be drawn by the mountain's rejection to kill you, as your outburst would disturb them.

The Great Ming King contemplated for a moment. "We'd need to study it thoroughly. Even if it's possible, we'd need these jade essences. Compressing it for personal use would still require them. Once removed, the mountain would quickly be shattered by the chaotic forces here."

He spoke softly, "If the disturbance is too great, it could cause trouble. First, from the ancient beasts, and second, from the Control King's lineage. The beasts are manageable, but if the Control King's lineage comes and sees the mountain destroyed, they'll immediately think of the jade essence. If it's gone, they'll easily connect it to us discovering their formation."

Su Yu nodded in agreement. "Besides the mountain, are there no other sources of jade essence?"

"There must be!" The Great Ming King explained, "Not just the mountain. It doesn't have to be jade essence. The bones, teeth, and horns of powerful ancient beasts here can also work, as long as they're strong enough. Since the beasts can survive here, they naturally avoid rejection!"

Su Yu understood, "So the best method is to kill the ancient beasts?"

"Yes, and if you want to shield against Daofuse fluctuations, you'll need to kill Daofuse Realm beasts..."

The Great Ming King elaborated, "It must match your level. Otherwise, if you unleash your full power, this thing will break."

Su Yu took a deep breath and nodded. "I understand! Strictly speaking, jade essence is still better, given that this mountain has existed for countless ages, right?"

"That's right."

The Great Ming King smiled, "For instance, the jade essence of this mountain would allow a Daofuse Realm expert to act without restraint!"

Su Yu calculated, grimacing at the thought of needing a lot of jade essence or having to kill many powerful ancient beasts to let his Daofuse Realm allies act freely in Chaos Mountain.

"Let's see how it goes!" Su Yu sighed. If it doesn't work out, they might have to leave Chaos Mountain alone for now. This trip wasn't necessarily about killing; it was about gathering information on the Upper Realm's situation. They had already gained unexpected insights into the Control King's lineage.

Overall, the harvest was substantial, including Su Yu's own enhanced understanding of the Great Dao. In the Upper Realm, he hadn't found the River of Time yet, so he couldn't merge with the pen dao. He needed to find the River of Time to progress further along the pen dao. Without it, he'd have to slowly grind his way forward, which would be slower.

With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu quickly said, "You study this formation. I'll head back first."

"Alright!" The Great Ming King had no objections, finding the study of formations quite enjoyable. The Control King's lineage's formation arts were more intriguing to him than their sealing arts. Of course, formations and seals often go hand in hand; formations can seal, and seals can be used as formations.

"If Emperor Yu ever takes down the Control King's lineage, I hope he can bring back insights into their formation arts. We might not follow the same system..."

The Great Ming King said with a smile, looking forward to it.

Su Yu nodded. He couldn't offer much help to the Great Ming King, but the ties between the Great Ming Prefecture and himself were deeper than those with the Great Qin Prefecture. Since the Great Ming King found the Control King's formation arts helpful, they'd revisit the topic when the opportunity arose.

...

In the cave where Marquis Anbei resided, Su Yu returned quickly. The cave had been cleaned thoroughly, and everyone was waiting.

Upon seeing Su Yu's return, before anyone else could speak, Grandstar said, "Emperor Yu, we can't all just wait here, can we? Those in the Daofuse Realm can act with you, but those below it don't need to stick around."

"My suggestion is to let Xiaguang and the others act independently. There are plenty of wars in the Upper Realm..."

Seeing Su Yu about to speak, he quickly added, "Don't worry. We, the Guardians, haven't been very active before. Many know the old turtle and Heavendoom, but not many know us!"

He explained, "It's like you, Emperor Yu. You're in the Daofuse Realm. Do you care about the subordinates of other Daofuse experts?"

"..." Su Yu chuckled, understanding his point.

Su Yu was indeed worried they might be recognized. But according to Grandstar, the old turtle and Heavendoom were quite flamboyant, while the others weren't well-known. They had always been big stones, so no one would care about their true appearances.

Not just him, but Xia Longwu also spoke up, "Emperor Yu, I agree! We didn't come to the Upper Realm to sightsee or gather in one place! My idea is to spread out, seek opportunities, and find opponents! We should also gather intelligence. It's better than staying here. I can feel that comprehending the power of the Great Dao is easier here."

"If we're discovered, we'll pretend to be under Marquis Tianyang, following the previous plan."

He quickly added, "Daofuse experts are few. The Upper Realm is vast, not as you imagine, where you can casually encounter them. It's just that your circle is too high-end. You meet people of that level because you're in that circle."

This was true!

Su Yu often encountered Daofuse experts because he could kill them. He could also meet small figures, but he didn't care to. Seeing them, he wouldn't bother.

It didn't mean the Upper Realm was full of Daofuse experts.

Previously, Su Yu couldn't access the Eternal circle and thought Eternals were rare and hard to meet. Later, he found that once you reached that level, you only saw Eternals. Anything below that, you wouldn't bother looking at.

This time, he brought a few humans to the Upper Realm.

Among the non-Daofuse, there were Xia Longwu, Extermination King, Nan Wujian, Yun Chen, Little Zhou King, and Hu Xiansheng—six in total.

Hu Xiansheng was the most unfortunate, at the peak of the Sunmoon Realm. He had progressed rapidly, having just reached the Sunmoon Realm with Su Yu's help, receiving a lot of treasures. Hu Xiansheng was one of the rare humans who could wield the power of space.

Bringing them up this time was indeed with the intention of helping them advance further.

However, Su Yu still frowned, "Acting alone is too dangerous..."

Xia Longwu replied solemnly, "Emperor Yu, we are warriors, not children! We didn't come with you for some benefits. We want to find a place where we can fight with all our might, to experience that life-and-death crisis again! In the lower realm now, we can't feel that anymore. We can't get involved in the great battles, and the Daofuse battles aren't for us. Even the Eternals are too scared to come out!"

Xia Longwu spoke in a deep voice, "We are warriors! We are also prodigies! We are not ordinary soldiers who simply follow orders. We have our own paths and aspirations to reach higher realms!"

He looked at Su Yu, his expression heavy. "I am Xia Longwu, the Xia Longwu who can kill an Eternal while in the Sunmoon Realm! I am the Blood Butcher King whom the myriad races do not wish to see prove his Dao. I ask Emperor Yu to grant me this chance!"

He was a genius, a prodigy who led an era before Su Yu and his peers. Though young, younger than many, before Su Yu's rise, he was the one the Myriad Realms sought to kill. While not as exaggerated as the current focus on Su Yu, he was still the most outstanding figure of his time.

Now, he was stepping forward to strengthen himself. He did not want to always follow Su Yu, as that would offer him no challenge.

Beside him, Nan Wujian and Yun Chen also had complex expressions. Nan Wujian softly said, "Let us venture out on our own! Protection cannot breed true strength!"

Nan Wujian chuckled, "We were once the leaders of our era. Though we have fallen behind now, we do not wish to remain so!"

The Great Zhou King, standing next to Su Yu, smiled and said, "Emperor Yu, let them go. Eagles soar in the sky not by being sheltered but by being set free!"

"In terms of battle experience, Xia Longwu has led armies for decades, undefeated from east to west. Tian Yuan has been lurking in the Hunting Heavens Pavilion for years, always on edge. Nan Wujian disguised himself as a Xuan Armor, hiding his identity for years without being discovered. Yun Chen pretended to be the leader of the Primal Sect, only revealing himself voluntarily..."

He listed these individuals one by one, smiling as he continued, "Since you brought them up here, you must have intended for them to grow stronger. You yourself grew through battles, so why not trust these veterans?"

Veterans?

Nearby, Marquis Dingjun hesitated for a moment and transmitted a message to Jiuyue, "Friend from the Iron Devourer Race, I forgot to ask, how old is this Emperor Yu?"

"Twenty-two?"

Jiuyue seemed to recall it was twenty-two, as it was the first year of the New Yu Calendar.

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun seemed to have surrendered, and Jiuyue was no longer so cautious. He transmitted back, "Why do you ask?"

"Nothing."

Twenty-two years old!

Marquis Dingjun felt a wave of doubt in his heart. After thinking for a moment, he transmitted again, "Then why do I feel like his lifespan is short?"

"Oh, it seems he burned his lifespan to open the path for Lantian."

Jiuyue was indifferent and transmitted again, "You better not provoke Lantian, and don't speak ill of Emperor Yu in front of Lantian, or you'll be doomed! Of course, you can talk to me about it!"

Jiuyue thought to himself, if you do say something, I'll report it immediately! That way, I'll have the credit for reporting it.

Marquis Dingjun ignored him and pondered Jiuyue's words.

Su Yu was only twenty-two!

He burned his lifespan to open the path for Lantian. No wonder he seemed to have a short lifespan. Marquis Dingjun had thought he was mistaken.

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun didn't know what to think. It was complicated. On one hand, he was worried about Su Yu's short lifespan. On the other hand, Su Yu burning his lifespan for others—did that make him a benevolent lord?

But... Su Yu's benevolence seemed to be reserved only for those close to him. Complex thoughts filled his mind.

...

Su Yu didn't concern himself with Marquis Dingjun's thoughts at this time. He glanced at the non-Daofuse cultivators present and, after a long pause, nodded. "Alright! Be careful out there. Also, return once a month; I might be leaving."

"Understood!"

Everyone was overjoyed.

Su Yu sighed inwardly. So be it; this was the only way.

He knew Xia Longwu and the others were right. He just worried if they might die out there. But, he thought, let it be.

Su Yu understood the principle: under protection, true geniuses and strong individuals cannot emerge. Such strong individuals would be like clay figures, easily toppled.

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun's daughter was also excited and said, "Emperor Yu, I want to go out and train too!"

Su Yu glanced at her.

Train?

She was at the peak of the Sunmoon Realm but might not have fought much, perhaps not even faced a life-and-death crisis. Xia Longwu and the others were battle-hardened, so there was no problem. But her... forget it!

It wasn't that Su Yu looked down on her, but if she went out, she'd be lucky to last three days before ending up dead in the streets!

The human race was already besieged by the myriad races. A fledgling at the peak of the Sunmoon Realm going out would be impressive if she survived three days.

Sure enough, Marquis Dingjun was self-aware. Upon hearing this, he immediately said sternly, "No, don't be ridiculous!"

His daughter had hardly experienced any real battles. Compared to a group of battle-hardened individuals, it was truly seeking death.

Among those present, there were a few at the peak of the Sunmoon Realm.

Hu Xiansheng, Changhe, and Tun Tian—any of them could easily kill his daughter.

"Father!"

Marquis Dingjun's daughter was somewhat unwilling. "I know I lack experience, but experience is accumulated. The more you prevent me from going out, the less experience I will have! It's like this now, and it will be the same in the future. If I don't go out, I'll never gain experience!"

"Emperor Yu said before, let me see how high the sky is and how thick the earth is. I want to see!"

Su Yu glanced at Marquis Dingjun, whose face was dark as he said in a deep voice, "You will die. It's not that I don't want you to train, but... the timing is not right..."

"Father, that's only because I'm your daughter! I'm not the only one among the new generation of upper realm humans. If the timing is never right, no one will ever progress!"

This seemed to make some sense.

Marquis Dingjun felt a headache, while the girl named Yuexi looked eagerly at Su Yu.

Yuexi, the hope of Bright Moon Flower Valley.

When Marquis Dingjun named his daughter, he clearly had some expectations and desires.

At this moment, Yuexi knew that Su Yu was the one in charge here, not her father.

Su Yu pondered for a moment and then said, "You want to go out?"

"I do!"

Su Yu smiled, "Alright, Dean Hu, you go with her!"

"Me?"

Hu Xiansheng was taken aback, almost spitting blood.

Su Yu smiled, "You're the dean, responsible for teaching and nurturing. These are tasks for a teacher! Besides, you're skilled in space arts and can escape! Two Sunmoon cultivators together will attract less attention."

With that, Su Yu smiled, "Yuexi, you must listen to Dean Hu at all times..."

Then, Su Yu's expression turned cold, "If you don't listen, a pig teammate can be more harmful than a strong opponent. At that time, Dean Hu can abandon her and escape alone! Your importance is greater than hers! The space teleportation array is still waiting for the dean to complete! In terms of importance, the dean is even more important than her father, so don't worry too much."

Su Yu said calmly, "If Marquis Dingjun finds this unsuitable, he can refuse now! Otherwise, if she dies outside, I won't care! If she dies, it's fine, but if Dean Hu is harmed because of her, I'll hold Marquis Dingjun accountable!"

"......"

Marquis Dingjun wanted to cry.

He felt miserable.

If my daughter dies, it's fine, but if Hu Xiansheng dies, you'll hold me accountable... This... I feel so pathetic, even a Sunmoon is more important than me?

He looked at his daughter, helpless, "Yuexi, you heard it. Better forget it!"

They don't even treat you as the daughter of a marquis!

Your father, I, am not even as important as this Sunmoon. If you get him killed, your father will be blamed!

At this, Yuexi's face changed slightly.

Su Yu said calmly, "Consider it yourself!"

Beside him, Hu Xiansheng was grinning. This was music to his ears.

Listen, family is family.

So what if you're an ancient marquis?

If I lose your daughter, it's fine. If your daughter gets me killed, you'll be in trouble. Now, a sense of superiority arose, feeling comfortable.

Earlier, he had complained about Su Yu giving him a burden.

Now, hearing this, what's the problem?

Yuexi gritted her teeth, "I... I'm willing to go out with Dean Hu! I'll take responsibility for my life and death! I won't implicate Dean Hu! If I die, Dean Hu doesn't need to save me. I grew up in the military, I understand these things. My father is also a military marquis, I naturally understand that new recruits are most likely to drag down veterans! Emperor Yu, I just lack experience, not intelligence!"

Su Yu was slightly taken aback, then smiled, "Indeed! You have some self-awareness. Very well, you're responsible for yourself! If you die and your father blames Dean Hu, or even betrays me, then I'll use him as a sacrificial flag. I'm just looking for an ancient marquis to use as a sacrificial flag!"

"......"

Damn!

Marquis Dingjun was almost cursing Su Yu in his heart.

You... why does it feel like you're deliberately trying to get my daughter killed, then force me to rebel, so you can use me as a sacrificial flag?

Is that what you mean?

He was a bit worried now. Would Hu Xiansheng deliberately get his daughter killed, and then Su Yu would find an opportunity to kill him, just because he mentioned the idea of serving two masters?

Not only him, but at this moment, many people looked at Hu Xiansheng with meaningful glances.

Was that what Su Yu meant?

Even Hu Xiansheng himself was blinking, transmitting, "Emperor Yu, when we... go out, should I... get her killed? This... isn't appropriate, right? She's just a poor child, I can't bring myself to do it. How about letting Lantian handle it?"

It's not appropriate!

He even wondered if Su Yu really had this intention.

It's possible!

Killing an ancient marquis to intimidate the other ancient marquises.

But Su Yu almost rolled his eyes.

Go to hell!

When did I say that?

I was just saying this to make Yuexi understand the seriousness of the situation, because Su Yu also hated pig teammates the most. Pig teammates often have more destructive power than strong opponents.

I was just scaring her a bit, and you all really can imagine things!

Even deliberately getting Yuexi killed... I'm impressed with you all!

Su Yu was speechless and said, "Alright, don't overthink it. I was just talking about possible consequences, not asking you to kill Yuexi!"

Yuexi's face turned pale, and Marquis Dingjun also looked embarrassed.

"Are you just saying that to comfort me?" someone asked, their voice tinged with skepticism. "Truly, serving a ruler is like serving a tiger—always on edge."

Su Yu, uninterested in further conversation, replied blandly, "Enough. I've said what needs to be said. When you're out there, be careful. If anyone is nearing the Daofuse Realm, don't break through just yet. Hold off. Breaking through here will cause a huge commotion, much larger than in the lower realms. If you must break through, find an opportunity to do it together, so the enemy can't pick us off one by one."

Everyone nodded in agreement.

"Changhe, Tun Tian, Kong Kong, you three should act independently and return to your respective races to gather information."

Jiuyue quickly interjected, "What about me?"

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "Your strength is too formidable. If the others show up in the Sunmoon Realm, no one will care. But if you, a Daofuse Realm expert, appear, the high-ranking members of the Iron Devourer Race will be puzzled as to how another Daofuse emerged."

"Alright then," Jiuyue conceded.

Meanwhile, on the Fate Clan's side, Changhe spoke softly, "Isn't Emperor Yu worried that if I return to the Upper Realm's Fate Clan, I might betray him?"

"I trust you," Su Yu replied.

Changhe felt uneasy. Trust? Really?

Su Yu quickly added with a smile, "Don't worry. At most, I'll have Lantian send a few dozen avatars to follow you, no more than a hundred. I do trust you to some extent, but I'm a cautious person. If you make contact with the Fate Clan and show any signs of betrayal, Lantian will eliminate you swiftly, and I'll return to the lower realm to deal with your clan first. Rest assured."

"…"

Changhe was speechless. Should he feel touched that Su Yu claimed to trust him? It was all so absurd.

Su Yu continued, "Trust is one thing, but necessary precautions are still in place. I don't like leaving my fate in the hands of others. Don't feel uneasy about being monitored. It's a special time, and surveillance might just be a scare tactic. Remember, anyone you meet could be Lantian in disguise, so keep your wits about you and don't assume everyone is a friend."

"…"

Everyone was stunned. Did this mean they had to be wary not only of enemies but also of their own companions and even strangers?

Su Yu chuckled, "Also, some of the people from the Upper Realm this time aren't their true selves but Lantian's avatars. Just be aware of it and don't worry too much. Lantian is quite skilled at impersonation."

The mental strain was palpable.

Beside Su Yu, a little girl with a lollipop in her mouth giggled innocently, "Don't worry, I'm great at disguises. The Extermination King knows this, right?"

The Extermination King's face turned pale. "Right, Emperor Yu, I want to act alone! Also, I don't want anyone approaching me. Even if they're allies, I won't acknowledge them. If anyone does approach, I'll treat them as enemies and kill them!"

"…"

Su Yu stifled a laugh. This was probably the Extermination King's last stand of defiance. He was essentially saying, "I'll mind my own business. Anyone who approaches me is either an enemy or Lantian."

Su Yu nodded, "Alright, everyone, don't approach him."

The others were equally speechless. With Lantian around, even if someone wanted to defect, they'd have to consider whether the person they were contacting was just another of Lantian's avatars. It was terrifying.

While everyone remained silent, Xia Longwu suddenly suggested, "Emperor Yu, perhaps we should set up a willpower sea seal…"

Su Yu frowned but soon smiled, "No need…"

"That's not what I meant," Xia Longwu clarified. "I'm worried that if we encounter a strong enemy, we might not have time to react or self-destruct, and they could probe our memories. If they discover the location of this passage or the situation in the lower realm, it could cause trouble."

He wasn't trying to defend himself; he was genuinely concerned about such a possibility. If a Heavenly King suddenly ambushed him, capturing and probing his memories, he might not have the chance to resist or self-destruct.

Su Yu pondered, and Xia Longwu continued, "It doesn't need to be complicated. Just compress some power of laws into it, so that if it comes into contact with a third party's power of laws, it explodes."

Xia Longwu smiled, "If it's buried deep in the willpower sea and someone else's power of laws intrudes, it means there's no hope. At that point, an explosion is acceptable."

Hearing this, the others nodded, and several guardians agreed, "That's convenient. If our willpower sea is invaded, as General Xia said, there's indeed no hope."

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded. With a wave of his hand, a large amount of chaotic power appeared before him, quickly compressing into small spheres. He distributed them, saying, "The willpower sea is fragile, so be careful not to let it explode! This thing will explode if it comes into contact with any willpower or power of laws other than mine or your own. It's just a precaution. Don't leave your willpower sea open for others to play with…"

Everyone was speechless. Who would be foolish enough to do that? Leaving their willpower sea open for others to play with?

Without further discussion, they implanted the spheres into their willpower seas. Su Yu smiled, "This has another benefit. I can locate you, so if you get lost, I can find you."

"If you encounter a strong enemy probing your willpower sea, don't rush to die. Just say it will explode, buy some time, and maybe I can save you!"

"Thank you, Emperor Yu!"

Everyone responded in unison. Moments later, they gathered their power of the Great Dao and flew out of the cave, ready to venture into the Upper Realm.

Simultaneously, numerous avatars of Lantian appeared and vanished into the void, making everyone uneasy. Even the Great Zhou King couldn't help but chuckle bitterly, "I thought you were just saying that."

Su Yu laughed, "How could I be? This isn't a trivial matter concerning just me. If Changhe and the others betray me, it's not just me who dies. I wouldn't pretend to be magnanimous and let them do as they please. If they really sell us out, you wouldn't even know it!"

Su Yu continued, "I've already warned them. If this still happens, wouldn't I be a fool?"

Su Yu wasn't concerned about appearances. What was the value of face? A simple 'I trust you' wouldn't make him open his heart. If Changhe or Tun Tian sold them out, Su Yu would be finished, everyone here would be finished, and the humans in the lower realm would likely be finished too. Would he risk everything for appearances? Not a chance.

He was straightforward, saying, "I don't fully trust you, so Lantian's avatars will follow you. It's that simple."

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment, nodded, and smiled wryly, "Indeed."

Su Yu was truly cautious to the core.

As they spoke, Marquis Dingjun watched his departing daughter with a heavy heart, filled with worry and sorrow. He didn't want her to go, but he knew she couldn't be sheltered forever. Experience had to be gained.

This veteran general, at a critical moment, could still let go.

As he brooded, his expression suddenly changed. He quickly took out a jade pendant from his bosom. Su Yu and the others turned their attention to him. The jade pendant was emitting a faint glow.

Marquis Dingjun examined it closely, setting aside his earlier sentiments, and said solemnly, "It's the Shadow Marquis! He's one of the few survivors who acts as a contact among us. Not exactly a contact, but he gathers intelligence and communicates it to us through certain means. Previously, he mainly contacted Marquis Minshan. Now that Minshan is dead, he hasn't contacted us for a long time."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "He's reaching out to you?"

"Yes," Marquis Dingjun replied gravely. "This jade pendant isn't for communication. It has no communication function. When it lights up, it means the Shadow Marquis wants to meet me. Once means he genuinely wants to meet, twice means there's danger, and thrice means he's unsure and leaves it to me to decide."

At that moment, the jade pendant lit up again, a second time. After a while, it lit up a third time.

Marquis Dingjun smiled, "He's testing me, to see if I've betrayed him, if I'll sell him out. It's a test."

Su Yu chuckled, "If you really betrayed him and agreed to meet, wouldn't he be walking into a trap?"

Marquis Dingjun sighed, "There's no other choice. He might have warned others too. If he dies and the pendant shatters, along with the warning, others will know I might have betrayed him. One death is better than everyone being compromised."

Su Yu thought it over and nodded, "If he's trustworthy, he's a decisive and loyal person. But he mainly contacted Marquis Minshan. With Minshan dead, he might not be a good person."

He added with a smile, "I know a Shadow too! The Great Ming Prefecture has a Shadow Guard, but they're good people. As for this one, who knows."

Marquis Dingjun smiled wryly, "I hope not…"

"We'll see," Su Yu said with a smile. "Do you want to meet him?"

Marquis Dingjun considered for a moment and nodded, "I want to meet him! The Shadow has been active outside and has more intelligence than I do. If he comes, it will be more helpful to Emperor Yu!"

"What if he's a problem?" Su Yu asked calmly. "What if he's brought countless strong enemies, waiting for us?"

"…"

Marquis Dingjun frowned, thought for a moment, and said, "Then we'll meet at the edge of Chaos Mountain. If he's brought people and betrayed us, they'll have to have the guts to attack us in Chaos Mountain!"

That made sense.

Su Yu nodded, "How will you arrange the meeting?"

Marquis Dingjun smiled, "Find a place and shatter this jade pendant. It represents where we'll meet. He can sense it. Once we meet, he'll give me another jade pendant…"

It was all very complicated and troublesome.

But Su Yu understood. They had no choice. The Shadow Marquis's communication methods were one-way, to prevent one person's mistake from implicating everyone else.

The Upper Realm's human race is truly in dire straits.

Su Yu suddenly chuckled, "I originally hoped you would descend to save us, but now it seems you are the ones in need of rescue."

Marquis Dingjun felt awkward, forcing a laugh, "Emperor Yu is right. This... was indeed unexpected for us."

He sighed inwardly. We thought you were the ones suffering! Who would have guessed that you were living carefree lives, striking fear into the myriad races in the Lower Realm, almost wiping out the three great races and unifying the Myriad Realms!

Had I known this was the situation, I wouldn't have sent so many people down, resulting in many deaths. Without sending anyone, this one would probably have come looking for us eventually!

Su Yu didn't concern himself with what Marquis Dingjun thought. He quickly said, "Let's meet in a couple of days. There's no rush. We'll wait until Xia Longwu and the others have moved far away."

"Alright."

Marquis Dingjun agreed readily. Su Yu added, "In the next couple of days, I'll scout the surroundings and get to know the neighbors. If any issues arise, I'll take them out for some fun!"

Everyone was speechless. The Great Zhou King advised, "Be cautious. If you plan to leverage their strength, be careful not to get yourself caught up in it."

The power of ancient beasts is not something easily borrowed.

Su Yu laughed, "Don't worry. It's time I returned to my old trade and did what I'm best at."

Marquis Dingjun was puzzled, but the Great Zhou King and the others understood what Su Yu meant.

Old trade? If it wasn't deceiving, it was tricking; if not tricking, then impersonating. That's how he made his name.

Who knows if it will work on ancient beasts?

The group didn't say much more, letting Su Yu do as he pleased. With his Heaven Gate open, he wouldn't easily get himself killed.
