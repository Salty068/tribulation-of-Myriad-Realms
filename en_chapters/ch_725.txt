Chapter 725: Escape (Seeking Subscription)

Within the Human Emperor's Great Dao.

Su Yu tore through the River of Time, entering its depths. He was heading towards the waterfall at the end of the river to seek refuge when his expression suddenly changed. Ahead, a formidable aura surged forth. A terrifying presence had torn through another node, blocking his path!

Clearly, one of those powerful beings he had observed had entered the river to intercept him. Su Yu frowned slightly but remained calm. The opponent was strong, but not a master of the rules. In this river, even if he couldn't defeat the opponent, killing him wouldn't be easy!

"The pinnacle of the Myriad Realms, is it?" Su Yu snorted inwardly. "I wasn't afraid of the Martial Emperor, why would I fear you?"

No longer the Su Yu who once revered the Eternal Realm, he had seen too many grand scenes and his status had risen continuously. Though the opponent was strong, Su Yu was not afraid.

"They've blocked my path..." Su Yu snorted coldly. "You want to play games with me? Fine, let's play!"

He turned and flew upstream. The Little Stone appeared again, suppressing the river's turbulent forces. Behind him, a powerful aura surged, breaking through the river's waves, chasing after him.

"You can't escape!" A cold voice echoed through the river, resonating in the minds of countless strong beings within the Source of the Dao. Many envisioned a figure with purple hair—Mota Tianzun!

Tianzun, a title of respect. Essentially, still a Daofuse expert. However, Tianzun referred to those whose realms had reached the level of rule masters but were restricted by the era, unable to control the Great Dao. In ancient times, such beings would inevitably master the Great Dao, becoming rule masters and dominators.

After ten thousand years of accumulation, countless geniuses emerged, and some eventually reached this level. Hundred Battle King was one, and so was Mota Tianzun. Even the fallen Human Race's Bingku was one.

As the experts in the Source of the Dao were shocked, Su Yu, clad in a black robe, coldly responded, his voice reverberating through the river: "You wretched thing, my lineage is noble beyond compare, with countless strong beings! You dare block my path, courting death!"

Arrogant? No! It wasn't arrogance, but pride! That innate pride couldn't be concealed, and his domineering tone was only natural!

Noble! This lineage, this individual, was extremely noble!

In the minds of those strong beings, this black-robed figure's aura might not match Mota Tianzun, but his demeanor and bearing seemed to overshadow him.

...

Within the Human Emperor's Great Dao.

Mota Tianzun, who was pursuing Su Yu, had a slight change in expression but quickly regained his composure. "It seems I've caught a big fish. Your status must be high!"

Status is judged by bearing. The one fleeing ahead had an extraordinary demeanor. Even within the so-called Chaos Race, this person was likely a significant figure, part of the core.

Strength can be accumulated, but demeanor is not. It depends on experience and daily status, whether one is accustomed to giving orders.

At this moment, Mota Tianzun realized he might have encountered a big fish!

Ahead, Su Yu moved through the air with a cold demeanor. "Catch me first before you speak! Old fool, the world is ultimately the Human Race's world. This Source of the Dao is still the Human Race's land. How dare you act recklessly!"

Human Race! Su Yu deliberately mentioned the Human Race.

Behind him, Mota Tianzun quickly broke through the air, moving at an incredible speed. Even the river's massive waves couldn't stop him.

"Human Race? Do you still consider yourselves Human Race?" Mota Tianzun didn't mind extracting some information before catching up.

And Su Yu didn't mind selling him some information. At this moment, his voice carried a hint of dominance and mockery: "Why not? The Human Race is the orthodox lineage of ancient times, the emperor's lineage. Why wouldn't my race be considered Human Race? Returning to chaos doesn't negate our status as Human Race. Chaos is also the beginning of creation. The Human Race is the orthodox emperor's lineage. Chaos Human Race only enhances our nobility. You dog-like thing dare question me!"

Mota Tianzun quickly absorbed and processed this information. So, this is the Chaos Race from the outside? Returning to chaos, claiming to be Human Race. The beginning of creation, the orthodox lineage of ancient times, descendants of emperors... No wonder they're so arrogant. This lineage is too proud, considering themselves superior, supreme. No wonder even when encountering him, they remain calm because of their innate pride!

This race is terrifying! This was Mota Tianzun's judgment. A being who had just stepped into the quasi-king realm, facing a top-tier quasi-king like him, yet remained so composed. This wasn't something ordinary people could achieve.

Mota Tianzun quickened his pace. The more this was the case, the more he wanted to capture the opponent. If he couldn't capture them alive, then he would kill them! No matter what, he couldn't let these people escape. Otherwise, where would the prestige of the Myriad Races be? Where would their dignity lie?

The Hundred Battle King broke the seal, and this Chaos Human Race killed eight quasi-kings, shaking the Upper Realm and the Myriad Races. If they weren't killed, how could the various races dare to face this lineage?

The battle of Chaos Mountain must be initiated! Too terrifying! The Dragon Race lost a quasi-king, and today eight more died. In a short time, nine quasi-kings and seven Daofuse experts perished. Even with many strong beings, the Myriad Races couldn't withstand such slaughter! If left unchecked, the Myriad Races would face extinction!

Before dealing with Chaos Mountain, they must gather intelligence about it. Clearly, these people were the best choice. The fleeing leader was part of the core; he must know many secrets of Chaos Mountain!

How many Daofuse experts are there in Chaos Mountain? How many quasi-kings? Are there any Tianzun-level experts?

At this moment, Mota Tianzun was already calculating the cost needed to eliminate this lineage!

Those in seclusion, those in slumber, all must come out! If this lineage isn't eradicated, the Myriad Races won't find peace.

...

With the Little Stone's suppressive power, Su Yu's speed surpassed Mota Tianzun's. The opponent would find it difficult to catch up. After all, this was Su Yu's home turf. However, Su Yu couldn't engage in battle with the opponent. Once engaged, he would surely be at a disadvantage. If he revealed any flaws, all prior preparations would be wasted! Some plans would also collapse.

At this moment, Su Yu's eyes flashed with determination. He transmitted to those within the Mark of Civilization: "Open the portal of the Mark of Civilization and follow me to kill!"

Everyone was shocked. They still had to confront this person? Too strong! A Tianzun-level existence, a true top-tier quasi-king, could be classified alongside the Hundred Battle King, only slightly weaker due to the latter's powerful physical dao.

And yet, they dared to fight?

Just as they were thinking, Su Yu suddenly tore through the River of Time, appearing at a location where a pseudo-dao tributary existed. As he appeared, a Daofuse expert was observing the Sealed Mountain, and his expression changed dramatically!

Su Yu struck with a palm, the power of the Little Stone suppressing the area. The opponent's dao power fluctuated instantly, and the Mark of Civilization opened. Lantian and the others attacked!

Boom!

With one strike, the Daofuse expert was shattered into pieces, exploding directly! The Mark of Civilization swept through, clearing everything. Su Yu tore through the River of Time again, diving back in.

Mota Tianzun was just about to tear through the river to pursue, sensing the opponent had fled. But before he could exit, Su Yu returned. At this moment, Mota Tianzun sensed something amiss.

Outside, another firework exploded!

The entire Source of the Dao descended into chaos!

A formidable presence, voice echoing through the heavens and the river, roared in fury: "Gather the Daofuse experts! Watch the movements in the River of Time, a marauder is slaughtering!"

Such a ruthless being! Being pursued by Mota Tianzun, yet daring to strike again, slaughtering all around!

Such a fierce person, no wonder they dared to attack those quasi-kings. Too ruthless!

Today, the tenth Daofuse expert had fallen.

...

Within the River of Time.

Those within the Mark of Civilization, including Marquis Dingjun, were gasping in shock. Brutal! Pursued by a top-tier quasi-king, Su Yu was still killing. This guy was too brutal. But... it felt so good!

This was too exhilarating!

They had wanted to do this for a long time but lacked the strength and ability. Now Su Yu was doing it, leading them to rampage across the land. It felt so good!

Just as they were thinking, Su Yu tore through the river again. Another Daofuse expert appeared before them, and upon seeing someone tear through the river, his expression changed drastically, roaring: "Tianzun, save me!"

The entire Source of the Dao was in complete chaos!

Countless strong beings fled towards the Sealed Mountain.

A terrifying presence was breaking through the River of Time, emerging to slaughter!

Mota Tianzun couldn't catch up!

Boom!

The Daofuse expert's roar was met with the full-force strike of Su Yu and over ten strong beings, turning him into dust!

Su Yu's voice echoed in all directions: "You lowly races, defying the higher, dare intercept me, today I'll make rivers of your blood flow!"

A cold shout pierced the heavens.

Even the Hundred Battle King, engaged in a fierce battle, couldn't help but glance towards Su Yu, suddenly laughing heartily: "So arrogant! That wretched woman, Yue Luo, has a subordinate like you, hahaha, she's unworthy! Join me, and I'll grant you..."

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to respond. "Survive first, then talk!"

No more nonsense!

Tearing through the river again, diving in, Su Yu quickly observed and fled.

Not long after he left, a figure appeared where he had just vanished.

Another Tianzun-level presence!

This Tianzun-level expert, eyes gleaming with divine light, frowned slightly, murmuring: "Locating Daofuse within the river, could it be... he opened the Heaven Gate?"

Otherwise, how could he pinpoint the location of the Great Dao, descending directly from the river to kill Daofuse!

Impossible!

After ancient times, the Heaven Gate remained closed!

But without opening the Heaven Gate, this person's methods couldn't be explained.

"A Chaos Race... a prodigy who opened the Heaven Gate!"

The figure's heart trembled, and at this moment, his expression shifted, instantly tearing through the river. Within the river, Mota Tianzun had just arrived, seeing the newcomer, he spoke in a low voice: "Yue Tianzun..."

The shadowy figure, known as Moon Heavenly Venerable, spoke in a deep voice, "It's difficult to seal this place. The River of Time here leads to the Land of Great Waves! This person is moving recklessly within the river, which means they must have some abilities! Perhaps they've opened the Heaven Gate... You continue the pursuit, and I'll lock onto their position from the Source of the Dao. Once they appear again, I'll attack from the outside while you attack from the inside. We must capture this person!"

"Understood!" Sky Heavenly Venerable nodded, feeling more assured with this plan. One inside, one outside! The thought of someone opening the Heaven Gate caused a slight tremor in his heart. Had this person truly opened the Heaven Gate? If so, they would be a core figure within the Chaos Race.

"The Land of Great Waves is a place even I find hard to approach. If they reach there, they will have no escape!" Sky Heavenly Venerable remarked, to which Moon Heavenly Venerable nodded before disappearing instantly.

...

Ahead.

Blue Sky's voice echoed, "Not enough killing, keep going!"

Keep going? No way!

"No more killing. We've been targeted. Another being of equal strength has arrived outside the river!"

Alright.

Upon hearing this, Blue Sky immediately ceased his actions. Soon, he chuckled, "Can you escape? If not, let's fight them here!"

Su Yu ignored him. Could he escape? Yes! But Su Yu hadn't yet decided which path to take!

First, the passage of the Fate Clan. Second, the true entrance to the River of Time. One leads to the Fate Realm, the other possibly connects to the ninth level of the Luminous Domain Mansion!

However, the Fate Clan's passage is fraught with the power of rules as punishment. Even if Su Yu hid everyone within the Mark of Civilization, the presence of so many people would still be detected by the rules, leading to severe punishment. Otherwise, the upper realm experts could easily bring dozens of Daofuse Realm cultivators to the lower realm with a spatial weapon.

Even if Little Stone could suppress it, the punishment power within the Fate Clan's passage would be exhausted, breaking the barrier between the upper and lower realms! That was not an outcome Su Yu wanted to see!

So, the only real option now was to head to the end and enter the true River of Time! Of course, there was another option. At this moment, he could try inheriting the Human Emperor's Dao. Even if it couldn't instantly match the power of the rule master, it could quickly enhance Su Yu's strength. Given that it was his home ground, Sky Heavenly Venerable might not be able to contend with Su Yu.

However, that was the last resort. With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu stopped killing. Killing two Daofuse cultivators was merely to intimidate the surroundings, preventing any reckless individuals from tearing through the river and blocking his path!

Now, those people dared not rashly tear through the river to enter.

...

Inside the Mark of Civilization.

At this moment, Marquis Huoyun and the others were quite excited. Another one had been killed, making it the eleventh Daofuse cultivator to die today! The killing was too easy!

For now, they didn't need to exert any effort. General Yingwu, despite the danger, couldn't help but ask, "Zhou Tiansheng, is this Human Lord always so relaxed in every battle?"

Everything seemed under control! It was reassuring, making the battle enjoyable. After six thousand years of pent-up resentment, it felt as if it had all dissipated, vented out!

The Great Zhou King smiled upon hearing this, "More or less! Emperor Yu excels at using the small to overcome the large, or rather, he's best at hiding his strength! No one has ever seen through our depths!"

When you think you've seen through him, Su Yu will bring more surprises. When you think he has only one Daofuse cultivator, Su Yu can produce five, catching the opponent off guard every time!

General Yingwu was somewhat excited, "So, in the lower realm, every battle is like this, killing people so easily?"

"Pretty much."

"So, when he said that in five battles, not a single Daofuse cultivator fell, it was true?"

"Of course!"

General Yingwu was shocked, "I thought he was boasting, but it turns out to be true!"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "Of course it's true. By the way, Hundred Battle King has been unsealed..."

"Oh!"

General Yingwu wasn't interested in discussing Hundred Battle King further, continuing excitedly, "Zhou Tiansheng, in the lower realm, is he really as authoritative as they say, with no one daring to oppose him?"

"Certainly!"

The Great Zhou King also found it unusual. Hundred Battle King had been unsealed! Yet, no one seemed to care. If Hundred Battle King knew, he might cry.

Alright, he decided not to mention Hundred Battle King anymore and quickly said, "In the lower realm, almost all of the Human Race's allies were brought in by him alone! The Iron Devourer Race, Space Ancient Beast Race, Hou Race, Fate Clan, Soul Devourer Race, and the powerful guardians left by the Culture King, including 36 Guardians and the entire Death Realm, were all secured by Emperor Yu alone!"

Marquis Huoyun couldn't help but ask, "The Fate Clan surrendered too? Back when Hundred Battle King tried to force Wuming to surrender, not only did Wuming refuse, but Destiny Marquis personally descended to battle Hundred Battle King... This..."

A difference in treatment, indeed!

Hundred Battle King was quite powerful back then, and the Human Race was at its peak. Yet, they didn't surrender. Now they had?

Before this, he didn't know the Fate Clan had also surrendered to Su Yu.

Blue Sky chuckled, "Because Hundred Battle King might not have been able to destroy the Fate Clan, and indeed, he couldn't! But Emperor Yu could destroy Wuming. Would Wuming dare not surrender?"

When Hundred Battle King fought the Fate Clan, the myriad races still had significant power in the lower realm. Moreover, the upper realm could open passages and send down some strong individuals. Naturally, the Fate Clan wouldn't compromise!

General Yingwu wasn't interested in the Fate Clan. At this moment, still excited, he asked, "I see he has a strong killing intent. Has he killed a lot in the lower realm?"

The Great Zhou King, seeing her focus on these questions, felt a bit helpless. It felt like he had returned to ancient times, to the era of the Culture King, when countless people were eager to learn everything about the Culture King.

Thinking this, the Great Zhou King maintained his composure and said, "Of course! Emperor Yu is an emperor forged through battle, not one who grew up in a greenhouse! He stepped onto the Allheaven Battlefield at the Skysoar Realm, slaughtering all around! Before that, even before reaching the Skysoar Realm, during the Nurturing stage, he had already orchestrated the death of a Sunmoon Realm!"

General Yingwu was excited, "Nurturing stage killing a Sunmoon Realm?"

"Not him directly, but he used external forces."

"Oh!"

General Yingwu asked, "Why was a Sunmoon Realm targeting him when he was just in the Nurturing stage?"

Nurturing stage... such an ancient term. General Yingwu tried to recall but couldn't remember what strength the Nurturing stage represented. It was certain that a single finger could crush it.

The Great Zhou King, seeing others listening intently, had no choice but to explain, "At that time, there was some turmoil within the Human Race. Emperor Yu was considered to have inherited the Culture King's cultivation system, and he was targeted. In a fit of anger, he switched allegiance from one faction of the Human Race to another, which was under the Great Ming King!"

The Great Ming King laughed, finally being mentioned, and quickly added, "At that time, Emperor Yu contacted my second son. My son, with his discerning eye, personally went to the Great Xia King's territory to welcome him into my Great Ming Prefecture. At Starfall Mountain, which is where the Culture King's Residence is located, they killed the Sunmoon Realm that was pursuing him!"

"I see!"

Marquis Yunshui couldn't hold back and asked, "Starfall Mountain?"

"Yes, it was the territory of Nanyuan in ancient times. Emperor Yu is from Nanyuan, the same hometown as the Culture King!"

Upon hearing this, Marquis Yunshui couldn't help but say, "Nanyuan has always produced heroes! The Culture King hailed from Nanyuan, and so does Emperor Yu. Indeed, I thought he had some of the Culture King's demeanor..."

The Great Ming King was speechless. Alright, you women are matching Su Yu with your imaginations. Think whatever you want.

They weren't in a hurry. With Su Yu around, they felt quite at ease. This was a feeling the ancient marquises hadn't experienced in many years!

However, Marquis Huoyun still thought of Hundred Battle King and hurriedly asked, "Hundred Battle King won't die, will he?"

Everyone was speechless. This... was hard to say.

General Yingwu coughed, "Well... isn't there a Human Lord now? I see he's very powerful and skilled. Even if something happens to Hundred Battle King... the Human Race still has hope!"

Hope had shifted! With hope shifted, looking at Hundred Battle King, he seemed like a big fool. Whether he lived or died... whatever.

Marquis Huoyun smiled bitterly, "Hundred Battle King is, after all, the leader of the Human Race's ninth tide, and he's extremely powerful. His survival is still greatly beneficial to the Human Race!"

You people are too cruel! You used to see Hundred Battle King as the only hope, and now you say it doesn't matter if he dies.

General Yingwu casually said, "I'm not cursing him. I also hope he lives, but... there's nothing we can do. Should we go save him now? If you have the ability, go save him! Being able to unseal him was already the best we could do! There were eight Heavenly Kings guarding him, plus a Heavenly Venerable-level expert... Being able to unseal him was something only the Human Lord could do. We've done our best!"

Marquis Huoyun thought for a moment, sighed, and nodded. Indeed! In this situation, if not for Su Yu, probably no one could have unsealed Hundred Battle King. Only when the lower realm opened might Hundred Battle King be surrounded and killed!

"Hope Hundred Battle King is alright!"

Marquis Huoyun wished for Hundred Battle King's safety, still hoping he could survive. Given Hundred Battle King's six thousand years of resentment from being sealed, if he survived, the first person he'd seek trouble with would be Moon Luo, followed by the myriad races. As for seizing power from the Human Race... that would have to wait!

...

Su Yu didn't concern himself with their discussion. At this moment, he had reached the end of the Human Emperor's Dao, where the surging river water clashed against the Dao!

Behind him, Sky Heavenly Venerable's speed had slowed, now bearing the brunt of the river's force. Su Yu turned to look; the opponent was still far from him. If he stayed here and engaged in a standoff, Sky Heavenly Venerable might not be able to outlast Su Yu.

However, once a battle commenced, if he couldn't kill the opponent, many of his secrets would be exposed. With the river's force impacting, Su Yu wasn't affected and still had the strength to fight.

He looked into the distance, and Sky Heavenly Venerable was equally shaken. How could this person reach the Land of Great Waves so effortlessly? The opponent's strength wasn't greater than his, that much was certain. But why did it seem like they arrived more easily than he did?

He gazed across the distance at Su Yu, feeling the strain from the impact of the River of Time's waters. He could only make out Su Yu's vague silhouette, and with a hint of vibration in his voice, he suddenly shouted, "Are you connected to the Human Emperor?"

This was his conjecture!

Su Yu, on the other hand, sighed inwardly. As expected, at this level, there were no fools. It didn't take long for them to deduce certain things. The fact that he had opened the Heaven Gate and might be related to the Human Emperor—these were things the other party could analyze.

Su Yu sneered, "I've said it before, my lineage is incomparably noble, far beyond the likes of your inferior bloodline! Do you intend to continue this standoff? If you retreat, I might spare your life in the future!"

"Arrogant!" Mo Tianzun replied coldly, "Even if you can easily reach this place, it's a dead end! There's no path ahead!"

Su Yu glanced at the massive opening of the Celestial River and said indifferently, "So what if there's no path? Even if I throw myself into the river and perish under the scour of time, I will not die by your hands. Inferior beings like you are not worthy of killing me!"

Suddenly, Su Yu looked at him with a cold gaze, "Why don't you dare to come forward? Are you waiting for others to join you? So-called Tianzun, is that all you are? You dare call yourselves Tianzun? Laughable! When the mountain is without a tiger, the monkey claims to be king! Do you think you deserve the title of Tianzun? Ridiculous!"

Mo Tianzun was at a loss for words. For the first time, or perhaps the first time since ancient times, he was being mocked!

The title of Tianzun was indeed grand. In ancient times, it certainly wouldn't have sufficed. But now, with the ancient era gone and the rulers of laws not appearing, they were indeed among the pinnacle of this era. They were the limit, the extreme! What was wrong with being respectfully called Tianzun?

Mo Tianzun didn't argue with Su Yu. He knew this person had a high opinion of himself and considered his bloodline noble, likely looking down on him. Thus, Mo Tianzun didn't want to waste words with Su Yu.

He advanced step by step, breaking through the massive waves, heading towards Su Yu. Behind him, the faint aura of another powerful being, the Moon Tianzun, could be sensed. Clearly, the other party also knew that Su Yu wouldn't escape anymore and was cornered.

There was no way out!

Su Yu ignored them and looked at the countless waters of the river crashing down from the opening, frowning slightly. It was not an easy path!

The Human Emperor's grand theft was not like the small opening of the Death Path; it was a massive pit! Have you almost severed the River of Time?

With such a large opening and so much river water crashing down, all of it was the power of laws. With such a strong impact, Su Yu felt that even with Little Stone, he might find it hard to withstand!

But now, he had no choice but to take this path. Or find a way to inherit the Path of Responsibility.

Once Mo Tianzun and the others arrived, it would be difficult for him to leave even if he wanted to.

Su Yu squinted his eyes. If he had enough lifespan, he wouldn't be afraid. At worst, he could use the Book of Time to avoid some crises. Unfortunately, his lifespan was running low.

However, Su Yu's strength had increased, and even without consuming his lifespan, he could still use the Book of Time to some extent.

He turned his head to glance behind him, his eyes narrowing. He didn't speak as Mo Tianzun approached step by step, resisting the impact of the massive waves, and said calmly, "Do you really intend to rush into that river mouth? That's a path to death! We've discovered this place years ago, and some powerful beings have tried to explore it! Back then, a being close to the ruler of laws wanted to explore what lay beyond the river mouth... but as soon as they entered, their lifespan was exhausted, and they decayed and fell!"

"Why seek death, my friend? If you don't resist and come back with me, everything can be discussed!"

Mo Tianzun still wanted to capture Su Yu alive! This person must be a high-ranking member of the Chaos Race!

Su Yu looked at him, then at the rapidly approaching Moon Tianzun behind him, and said calmly, "Want to capture me alive? Dream on! Sacrificing myself for my race, burning my holy body, it's all worth it! Today, Ziyan is gone. If I leave... so be it. Lord Yue Luo won't spare you!"

Su Yu sneered, "I hope that idiot Bai Zhan can survive, so Lord Yue Luo's efforts won't be in vain!"

Yue Luo!

Mo Tianzun remembered this name. In fact, he had known it for a long time. During Bai Zhan's imprisonment, he often cursed this Yue Luo.

Mo Tianzun thought of something, recalling the one who sealed Bai Zhan back then... so it was Yue Luo, a strong figure of the Chaos Race!

Ziyan, Yue Luo, and this young man in black robes, along with a quasi-king hiding in the opponent's weapon... this lineage now had at least four quasi-kings known, plus the one who came to rescue Bai Zhan thousands of years ago.

At least five quasi-kings!

A terrifying lineage, almost unknown before the Ninth Tide, only recently becoming vaguely noticeable, but previously very little was known!

Mo Tianzun said softly, "You have a bright future ahead, yet you're willing to die here?"

Su Yu sneered, "Those who see the sky from the bottom of a well will never understand our pursuit! It's just a shell; losing it is nothing. My spirit will endure! When my Chaos Human Race unifies this world, I can return once more!"

Like a madman!

Even Mo Tianzun felt a chill. This lineage was too crazy!

At this moment, Moon Tianzun had already arrived. The two exchanged a glance and said nothing more. This person couldn't be persuaded. They could only capture him before he rushed into the river mouth. Even if they couldn't capture him alive, taking his body would suffice!

The two of them instantly charged towards Su Yu!

Meanwhile, Su Yu waited silently. When the two approached, he suddenly snorted coldly.

"Burn my holy body!"

"Kill!"

Boom!

Countless waters of the River of Time erupted in an instant!

Su Yu secretly manipulated Little Stone to suppress a large amount of the River of Time's waters, then urged those waters to form a massive wave that surged towards the two!

Su Yu himself also quickly soared into the air, diving headfirst into the rushing river waters with a face full of piety and a look of resolute determination. He laughed loudly, "Even in death, I will not die by the hands of petty scoundrels. You are not worthy of killing me!"

"I will merge myself into this great path!"

"Hahaha!"

With a wild laugh, Su Yu instantly dove in, disappearing from sight.

Then, the massive wave erupted!

Boom!

The two top-tier experts were continuously rolled back by the impact of the massive wave.

They retreated a great distance, and Mo Tianzun coughed up a mouthful of blood, with a hint of helplessness and regret, "Such an arrogant fellow, strong indeed, but... what a pity..."

Moon Tianzun also coughed lightly, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, and said with some uncertainty, "Is he really dead?"

Mo Tianzun sighed, "What do you think? If you and I were to rush in, we'd probably fall soon as well! Even if this person had heaven-defying means, he likely couldn't survive!"

After speaking, he added, "Let's keep watch here for a day. If there's no sign of him after a day... then he's surely dead!"

Moon Tianzun nodded slightly, also sighing, "I don't think he's very old, and he might have opened the Heaven Gate. What a pity! But this also proves that the Chaos lineage is unimaginably strong! I'm afraid... it's going to be a tough battle!"

Mo Tianzun nodded, also sighing. It was going to be a tough battle!

Moon Tianzun added, "As for Bai Zhan... if we stay here, we might not have time to deal with him."

Mo Tianzun chuckled, "If he's killed, that's just bad luck for him! If he's sealed again, that's because he's not strong enough! If he survives..."

Mo Tianzun said calmly, "Then let him live! He still has a seal on him. If he wants to break it and restore his full strength, do you think he'll come for us first?"

Mo Tianzun said quietly, "Yue Luo! A strong figure of the Chaos lineage, she's the one who sealed Bai Zhan. Bai Zhan hates her to the bone! To break the seal, either Yue Luo helps him, or he kills Yue Luo. I think letting Bai Zhan go is a good idea! Let him test the waters of the Chaos lineage for us!"

Moon Tianzun also laughed, "Indeed, Bai Zhan is impulsive, domineering, and self-centered! Betrayed and sealed by Yue Luo for years, if he truly escapes, he probably won't come for us first."

Mo Tianzun nodded, "Kill if we can, seal if we must, but if he escapes, don't worry too much!"

Mo Tianzun laughed, "He was the strongest back then, but over the years, we've also made progress. Back then, the Human Race's strength wasn't just in him alone; there were also supreme beings like Bingku and quasi-king level experts like Minshan. The Ninth Tide battle nearly wiped out the Human Race's strong. Now, even Marquis Dingjun has followed that man into the river mouth!"

Bai Zhan is now just a lone wolf!

Even if you escape, what can you do?

Moon Tianzun also chuckled, indeed.

No rush to return!

They needed to ensure that Su Yu couldn't return.

After a day, even if he wasn't killed by the impact, he'd die of old age in this place!

...

At this moment, Su Yu was continuously battered by the impact.

The Book of Time fluctuated slightly, dispersing the nearby power of the river.

Little Stone and the Human Lord Seal were both suppressing!

However, the immense impact still made it difficult for Su Yu to endure, like a lone boat in the vast ocean.

The Mark of Civilization also erupted with waves of the power of laws.

The Great Zhou King and others were all exerting their strength.

Su Yu panted heavily, swimming against the current.

Break through!

As long as he broke through this opening and entered the true River of Time, he might be able to leave smoothly.

Even if he appeared in the lower realm, it wouldn't be a big deal.

"Charge!"

Su Yu shouted lowly, swimming against the current once more. At this moment, he truly felt his insignificance. Even though he had the combat strength of a Heavenly King, in this vast river, he was still just a drop in the ocean!

And back then, the Human Emperor could open such a large opening. In this regard, Su Yu was far from capable!

Boom!

The massive waves relentlessly battered Su Yu. Without the Little Stone and the Book of Time, he would have perished long ago. At this moment, Su Yu truly realized the immense benefits these items had brought him.

"Xingyue..." 

Suddenly, Su Yu thought of Xingyue and chuckled. If it weren't for the serendipitous encounter with Xingyue that revealed the existence of these items, he might have missed many opportunities this time and wouldn't have been able to slay so many powerful Heavenly Kings.

"Break through!"

Su Yu shouted again, surging against the current with all his might. As long as he could break through this barrier, he was confident he could escape. Lantian and the others were also giving it their all.

Boom!

The sound of collisions echoed continuously. Su Yu coughed up blood repeatedly, unsure how long he had been charging upwards. Suddenly, he felt the pressure lighten.

In an instant, he emerged above the river's surface!

At this moment, Su Yu was utterly exhausted, his injuries severe. The others within the Mark of Civilization were in a similar state, all greatly depleted. Yet, Su Yu's eyes shone with a terrifying brightness!

I made it out!

He had broken through the barrier!

He could feel the aura of the River of Time!

I have stepped into the true River of Time.

Looking down, he saw a vortex forming beneath him, faintly revealing a large hole below... The Human Emperor was truly extraordinary, almost digging through the River of Time!

Su Yu coughed up blood and laughed.

He glanced around and, sure enough, with the Heaven Gate open, he saw a small tributary on one side of the River of Time. It was indeed different from the usual Great Dao. Su Yu had a feeling that it wasn't a Great Dao, but rather... a passage secretly opened by the Human Emperor himself!

A passage leading to the Luminous Domain Mansion!

At this moment, Su Yu had neither the energy nor the strength to find another exit.

This will do!

The next moment, Su Yu charged towards that passage!

Boom!

With a loud crash, Su Yu's figure vanished into the River of Time.

He was out!

At this moment, he had entered the Luminous Domain Mansion.
