Chapter 804: Meeting the Martial Emperor Again

Lantian's group had all advanced, something Su Yu hadn't anticipated. Not just one or two, but everyone who could advance today, or who he expected might advance soon, had done so. Moreover, Su Yu's own world was rapidly expanding as it absorbed a large number of ancient beast corpses and the paths of the Heavenly Sovereigns. His world was growing from the size of a small city to something approaching the scale of the Great Xia Prefecture's capital. Of course, compared to the heavens of the Myriad Realms or the Death Realm, it was still quite small. Even compared to the Dao Source Land, it was far inferior. Yet, everything was moving in a positive direction.

...

Some people had gains, while others did not. Understanding the Dao sometimes depended on talent and opportunity. Even though Su Yu had opened up his insights for everyone, not all could benefit. At this moment, Su Yu looked at the crowd, noticing their increasing strength. This was a good thing, but reaching the Heavenly Sovereign level was a limit for many. Like March and others, it was difficult for them to improve further. Becoming a top-tier Heavenly Sovereign wasn't just about comprehension; it depended on the strength of one's Dao. For instance, March's Dao might only be so strong, and his limit was his current state. Unless they became rulers of laws, March and others might have reached their life's peak.

Feeling Su Yu's gaze, everyone felt a bit uneasy. Su Yu's growing authority made being under his scrutiny quite pressuring. He only watched for a moment before turning his attention to the Heaven Monitoring Marquis, smiling, "At this point, all forces have been exposed. Except for Hundred Battle's side, where his son's strength is uncertain, everything else is clear!"

"Before the return of the various eras, the situation in the Myriad Realms is already clear!"

"The only uncertainties are a few wandering powerhouses: the Martial Emperor, the Necromancer Sovereign, the Chaos Dragon, and the Eight-Winged Tiger. However, even if the Necromancer Sovereign breaks free, without revival, it's hard for him to leave the Death Realm. Even if he does, he might not be of much use. So, the real wanderers are just three!"

The Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng stood on either side, almost like one person. At this moment, the Great Zhou King pondered, "Your Majesty's intention is... to first bring the three wandering powerhouses under your command?"

As for the Necromancer Sovereign... perhaps he could be subdued too. Once subdued, he wouldn't need to do much, just help Su Yu stabilize the Death Realm, serving as a retreat. Anyone attacking the Death Realm would face the Sovereign's wrath, making him an excellent guardian. But these wandering powerhouses were not easy to subdue.

Su Yu smiled, "The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger can be set aside for now. They're both eyeing the chaotic will of Prison Green, even the Dragon Beast! So, their goals align with ours! But the Martial Emperor..."

Su Yu fell into contemplation.

Wan Tiansheng chimed in, "The Martial Emperor is proud... or rather, ambitious but lacking talent!"

Well, that was quite the disdain!

Indeed, it wasn't the first time the Martial Emperor had been looked down upon!

Wan Tiansheng continued with a smile, "The Martial Emperor is actually easily satisfied, content with small fortunes! He opened the Heaven Gate, showing great talent! But he's somewhat like the North King. Does Your Majesty remember what the North King said before his death? He just wanted to be a local overlord, unwilling to submit to others, yet lacking the strength to stand alone, still wanting to rule his own territory..."

Hearing this, Su Yu was taken aback. There was indeed some similarity!

Wan Tiansheng continued, "The Martial Emperor opened the Heaven Gate but always stuck to his path, unwilling to expand, with a mindset leaning towards the old and conservative! On one hand, he knew the Culture King and Human Emperor were powerful, but his pride made him want independence, not wanting to join! Ultimately, he was defeated and sealed by the Martial King. I think it wasn't about killing the innocent but rather that the Human Race needed to kill one of its own powerhouses to intimidate others!"

How could the Human Race unify the heavens if it couldn't even unify internally?

Thus, the Martial Emperor, who opened the Heaven Gate, became an example.

Wan Tiansheng continued, "According to Your Majesty's words, the Culture King knew back then but tacitly agreed! However, it was the Martial King who first proposed dealing with him. The Martial King might not have had the brains for it... so I suspect it was the Human Emperor's directive!"

He analyzed, "The Human Emperor needed to deal with the Martial Emperor, but the Martial Emperor might not have committed any major wrongs, so he wasn't killed, just sealed!"

Did the Martial Emperor do wrong?

Not necessarily!

Like the North King of the Death Realm, did he do wrong?

He simply didn't want the Human Race to dominate him again. He just wanted to guard his own territory, but in such an era of great contention, if you don't have the strength to dominate a region and refuse to submit to the strong, then you're wrong!

So, the North King died, at the hands of Marquis Dragonblood, having barely fought against Su Yu's side.

The North King's death was just a microcosm of this era.

And the Martial Emperor was just a microcosm of that era.

Su Yu nodded, "What you say makes sense. I can understand all this. The only thing I can't understand is, after the Martial King sealed the Martial Emperor, there seemed to be an element of humiliation. Was it necessary for the Martial King to do so?"

Sealing the Martial Emperor, or turning him into the Luminous Domain Mansion, wasn't the issue. The key was the posture, which was excessively humiliating for a powerhouse, almost suggesting a fight to the death.

On this point, the crowd was also puzzled.

Wan Tiansheng looked at the Great Zhou King, who shook his head, "I followed the Human Emperor in the later period. The Martial Emperor's matter was quite early. I'm not really sure."

Heh!

Forget it, Wan Tiansheng didn't press further and continued, "Your Majesty, the Martial Emperor, according to my analysis, is someone who values face, timid in action but bold in words! If given enough face and a way out, he can be won over!"

"Using force to coerce him might make it difficult to subdue him!"

Wan Tiansheng smiled, "Otherwise, the Human Emperor and Culture King, being stronger than Your Majesty, would have subdued him long ago, wouldn't they?"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Indeed, and if it were over a hundred thousand years ago, giving face, the Martial Emperor might not have cared. But after being sealed for so long, he must realize that his era is truly over!"

After over a hundred thousand years of imprisonment, even the foolish Martial Emperor would understand that this era isn't his, nor was the last!

At this moment, Lantian interjected with a smile, "The Martial Emperor's greatest resentment now is that the Martial King dealt him a vicious blow! If Your Majesty promises him a chance to defeat the Martial King, or to deal with the Martial King in the same manner... I think he would be tempted!"

At this point, Marquis Lanshan couldn't help but interject, feeling a bit uneasy, "Isn't that inappropriate? Lord Martial King... I..."

That was her former master!

Using the Martial King as a bargaining chip to subdue the Martial Emperor seemed inappropriate to her.

Of course, from others' perspectives, they weren't familiar with the Martial King. At this juncture, if empty promises could win over the Martial Emperor, it would be quite worthwhile.

Lantian chuckled, "Your Majesty never said he would personally deal with the Martial King! We can promise the Martial Emperor to help him grow stronger. Revenge is his own business! Your Majesty's side will block the Culture King and Human Emperor... giving him a fair duel opportunity!"

"Senior Lanshan... times have changed!"

Lantian smiled, "Now, Your Majesty needs such support! The Martial King was originally stronger than the Martial Emperor, and the Martial Emperor has been sealed for over a hundred thousand years, while the Martial King hasn't. If, at this time, the Martial King fears losing in a duel to the Martial Emperor, it would destroy his belief in inevitable victory!"

"So, even if we make some promises, for the Martial Emperor and Martial King, it actually costs nothing, but it gives the Martial Emperor a way out and something to hope for!"

Clearly, everyone agreed with subduing the Martial Emperor.

However, some still felt it was inappropriate. The South King spoke up, her voice cold, "All of this is based on the Martial Emperor's willingness to submit. If he doesn't want to, what if he seeks revenge on Your Majesty immediately after breaking the seal? He's powerful, and once unsealed, he might be the strongest in this era! As the strongest, would he really submit?"

"As for promises, they are based on certain foundations. Would the Martial Emperor still care about these?"

"Don't be too optimistic!"

The South King poured cold water on their enthusiasm!

Su Yu was eager for talent, which was understandable. After all, with the emergence of rulers of laws, he was under pressure. But if he pinned his hopes on the Martial Emperor's submission, the greater the hope, the greater the potential disappointment!

Su Yu nodded, acknowledging the point.

Wan Tiansheng chuckled, "Senior South Heavenly King, your reminder is appreciated, but... it's worth a try!"

He quickly continued, "Your Majesty, the Martial Emperor is a proud and arrogant individual. He looks down on most people. To win him over, only Your Majesty can go personally!"

The Martial Emperor referred to others as "little bugs," which showed his mindset. Even after being sealed for many years, he still looked down on the weak. Only Su Yu could possibly win him over.

The Great Zhou King added, "Indeed, apart from Your Majesty, no one else can do it. On our side, we can try to find the Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger. We don't need to subdue them, but we can reach a temporary agreement. Their target is Yu Qing and his group! We can assist them in dealing with them!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment and nodded again. It was worth a try!

He fell into deep thought, then said, "Currently, the urgent task is to deal with the Sin Clan and the myriad races. As for Hundred Battles, we can set it aside for now! Regarding Hundred Battles, I have some doubts... He planted the spy Yue Luo within the Sin Clan. Is his ultimate goal the Sin Clan, or the Hell's Gate behind them?"

In the past, Hundred Battles might have feared the Sin Clan and the myriad races, but now, he shouldn't be too afraid. Yet, he still remained patient. Before Yu Qing appeared, others might not have known the situation, but Yue Luo certainly did. At that time, Hundred Battles was powerful. If he had pretended to be mad and foolish, and acted when Su Yu attacked Yue Qin and the others, and the myriad races also took action, Hundred Battles could have joined in... and then had Yue Luo and the others rebel. There was hope to destroy the Sin Clan!

Afterward, they could consolidate their strength and deal with the myriad races.

But Hundred Battles did not do that!

So what is his ultimate goal, the Sin Clan or the Hell's Gate?

Does he have the capability to deal with the existence behind the Hell's Gate?

This was difficult for everyone to discern. The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and said, "Hundred Battles inherited the bloodline of the Human Ancestor, so some of his objectives might be related to the Human Ancestor, including bringing the Human Ancestor back!"

The Great Zhou King pondered, "Assuming the Human Ancestor isn't dead, where is he? Behind the Heaven Gate, or behind the Hell's Gate?"

He spoke solemnly, "This is hard to judge! Because the Human Ancestor appeared in the early Taigu era, and the Heaven Gate might have already appeared by then. Since the Human Ancestor cultivated the physical body path, I think if he were to explore the previous era, would he enter the Chaos Era where the physical body was stronger?"

The ancient Chaos Race mostly cultivated the physical body.

The Human Ancestor also cultivated the physical body!

The Great Zhou King speculated, "In this case, does Hundred Battles know something? Is he actually trying to bring the Human Ancestor out first, and the Human Ancestor might be behind the Hell's Gate!"

"Hundred Battles planting Yue Luo might not just be to deal with the Sin Clan. It could also be to learn more about the Hell's Gate!"

He added, "And what about the Demon Clan? Is the Flame Demon Emperor really behind the Hell's Gate? Otherwise, why would the Demon Clan ally with the Sin Clan?"

Everyone was analyzing the purpose of Hundred Battles.

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "Forget it, it's hard to judge for now! There aren't enough clues! I don't know if there's any conflict between the Human Ancestor and the Human Emperor or anything else, but Hundred Battles can't be the good guy, and neither can I. That's just how it is!"

Su Yu smiled, "The myriad races are now sealed off, and Yu Qing's side is not weak... Once we deal with Yu Qing and his group, we can find an opportunity to deal with the myriad races, and finally, Hundred Battles. That's my current plan!"

Su Yu continued, "To unseal the Martial Emperor, the power of laws from both the Upper and Lower Realms must dissipate completely! We... might also take this opportunity to break the barrier between the Upper and Lower Realms! Let the realms reconnect! Let all forces gather together! Let the realms be open!"

Everyone nodded. This would indeed force Hundred Battles to face all sides directly.

Treating Hundred Battles as a hypothetical enemy was absolutely necessary.

Or rather, the two sides would inevitably clash sooner or later.

Two tigers cannot share one mountain!

Both are of the human race, but one side is the Human Ancestor's legacy, while Su Yu is essentially part of the Human Emperor's system. There are bound to be conflicts.

"Then I'll take a trip to the Death Realm!"

Su Yu smiled, "It's time to have a chat with those two!"

He looked at the others, "Continue your cultivation, and design ways to lure some ancient beasts into our world, deal with them, and let Lantian integrate them into our world! Additionally, I'll have my world quickly erode the entire Chaos Mountain region!"

"Other places are hard to invade, but Chaos Mountain is a chaotic place, so it's relatively easier!"

Back then, the Human Emperor opened the Dao Source Land, intending to invade the entire Upper Realm, but unfortunately, he failed. Now, Su Yu also aims to invade Chaos Mountain and the Upper Realm!

After saying this, he gave some instructions to everyone and quickly walked out.

Behind him, the Heaven Monitoring Marquis suddenly said, "When will you kill me?"

Su Yu turned back and smiled, "What's the rush? Is the Heaven Monitoring Marquis in a hurry to die?"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis calmly said, "Not really, I'm just wondering if my death will mark the true end of the ancient era?"

"The ancient era?"

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then smiled, "I can only say that after your death, the illusion of unity among the myriad races in the ancient era will end! The human race... never truly unified the myriad races! As for the ancient era... it's just a name, our name! The Human Emperor is still the Human Emperor, and we... are still us!"

The Heaven Monitoring Marquis silently pondered Su Yu's words and said nothing more.

And Su Yu quickly disappeared from sight.

...

At the same time.

Deep within the chaos.

Yue Luo and Yue Xiao were desperately fleeing, yet they seemed to have lost their way. Chaos had no direction, no limits.

Yue Luo looked around, seeing only chaos.

For a moment, a sense of desolation filled her heart.

After years of hiding, before Hundred Battles could give any orders, Su Yu, that bastard, had already disrupted the entire situation. That guy deserved to die!

Yue Xiao, panting heavily, spoke, "Yue Luo, are you sure this place leads to the Lower Realm?"

"It should!"

Yue Luo had never traversed it, but she knew it was possible.

At this moment, she looked around, and soon, a talisman appeared in her hand, which she ignited.

As the talisman burned, waves of residual power spread out.

After an unknown amount of time, the void seemed to crack open. Yue Xiao's face changed slightly, and at that moment, a massive ancient beast appeared, exuding a powerful aura. Atop the beast stood a person.

The ancient beast resembled a giant fish but had enormous wings, similar to a Kunpeng.

The beast's huge eyes were cold and chilling.

At this moment, it looked at Yue Luo and Yue Xiao.

Yue Luo frowned slightly and quickly said, "We've been exposed!"

The beast remained silent, but the giant figure atop it suddenly opened his eyes, exuding an overwhelming pressure as he looked at them, "Exposed?"

"Yes!"

"Did Yu Qing discover you?"

"No, it was Su Yu!"

Yue Luo looked at the young man atop the beast and said, "Su Yu led the myriad races to attack the Holy Clan, forcing us and Thunderstorm to fight each other to the death! I had no choice but to flee!"

"Su Yu..."

The figure opened his eyes, revealing a smile, "It's him!"

With that, he looked at the two and said, "Are you heading to the Myriad Realms?"

"Yes!"

Yue Luo nodded, "We can no longer hide and must leave! Before we left, the Granny Dragon Beast might have been summoned, Yue Zhan is still alive, but almost everyone else is dead!"

"What a pity!"

The young man laughed, "I wanted to use them as whetstones for Father when he returns. Changqing and the others haven't fought for a long time and need someone to sharpen their skills. I didn't expect them all to die. What a pity!"

He then laughed, "Let me take you to the Lower Realm. Follow me!"

Yue Luo said nothing, but Yue Xiao couldn't help but ask, "Your Highness Ji, have you been in the depths of chaos all this time?"

The young man chuckled, "Sort of! Chaos... is quite interesting! Grinding one's path in chaos is actually quite fascinating! If you have time, you should try it. Even just walking in this desolate chaos is interesting... By the way, someone divined me earlier. Was it Su Yu?"

Yue Luo replied, "I'm not sure, probably. He knows of your existence. He even called out to you before. You and His Majesty are both exposed now, though your exact strength is unknown."

"Exposed is exposed!"

The young man didn't mind, smiling, "You can hide for a while, but not forever! Besides, hiding isn't the goal! These years, I've just been waiting for the right moment. Now, with the Hell's Gate about to open, exposure doesn't matter!"

Yue Luo frowned slightly, "Even if the Hell's Gate opens, the situation is still complex..."

"I know!"

The young man waved his hand, "Discuss these matters with Father. I won't get involved!"

He didn't care much about these things, riding the ancient beast swiftly downward through the chaos. As he flew, he said, "Earlier, there was a disturbance in the chaos. The Chaos Dragon and the Eight-Winged Tiger seemed to have rushed over. Kun Fei also sensed something. The commotion probably came from near the Death Realm!"

"Quite a few ancient beasts might have been killed, possibly related to Su Yu!"

The young man said casually, "You can inform my father about this. Su Yu might have done something."

Yue Luo asked, "What did Su Yu do?"

The young man smiled faintly, "I didn't pay much attention. I was busy at the time, but the commotion was significant, probably not simple. Tell my father, and he'll naturally be concerned!"

Yue Xiao asked, "Did Your Highness encounter a formidable enemy in the chaos?"

Otherwise, what could have happened?

But are there strong beings in the chaos?

Truly powerful beings are all sealed behind the Hell's Gate.

In today's chaos, encountering a being like the Chaos Dragon is already rare.

The young man smiled faintly, "Not a formidable enemy, just something interesting. I'm pursuing time!"

The two were stunned.

Pursuing time?

What does that mean?

The man chuckled, "Does the River of Time have an end? Naturally, it does. I've been pondering where its end might be. This river, stretching across the Myriad Realms—if we trace its path, can we find a trace of it? Is the Heaven Gate at its end?"

"The end of the world, the end of the river—could that be where the Heaven Gate lies?"

He murmured to himself, "The Gate of Hell has always existed, yet the Heaven Gate remains elusive! But now, perhaps... I've begun to discern some patterns! If one end of the river is the Heaven Gate, then what lies at the other?"

"Did the Master of Time enter the Heaven Gate, or was it another gate?"

"The Celestial River of Death has an end... but the River of Time does not. Indeed, the Master of Time is the most terrifying existence!"

As he spoke, Yue Luo and Yue Hao listened, somewhat understanding, yet deeply shaken.

This person... his pursuits were lofty.

Unlike theirs!

The man seemed to realize he was speaking to the wrong audience and smiled, "Forget it, these aren't matters for you to worry about!"

Yue Luo remained silent.

The three of them, along with a beast, swiftly flew towards the depths of chaos.

After a while, Yue Luo and Yue Hao, unable to discern their direction, heard the man suddenly say, "Fly straight ahead, and soon, you'll return to the Myriad Realms!"

Yue Luo nodded slightly, "Thank you!"

"You're welcome!"

The young man laughed, "Tell my father I need to explore a bit more and won't return too soon!"

"Alright!"

The young man, riding the ancient beast, vanished in an instant.

Yue Luo and Yue Hao watched him leave, and Yue Hao transmitted, "What level of strength does he possess? He seems... even more terrifying than Control King!"

"Hard to say!"

Yue Luo watched for a while longer before saying, "Never mind him, let's head to the Myriad Realms!"

The two of them quickly flew towards the Myriad Realms.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was also heading towards the Death Realm.

Halfway there, Su Yu suddenly raised an eyebrow. In the distant direction, he seemed to see something—a massive figure appeared.

He focused his gaze, but from such a distance, it was hard to see clearly.

It seemed to be a giant Kunpeng beast.

Su Yu looked carefully and vaguely saw a person atop the beast's head.

And over there, the young man atop the beast also glanced in Su Yu's direction, faintly perceiving Su Yu's presence.

At that moment, they exchanged a glance across the void.

Soon, neither lingered, each continuing on their path, quickly distancing themselves and disappearing into the endless chaos.

...

"A giant beast... a human figure..."

At this moment, Su Yu fell into contemplation.

Who was the figure wandering in the chaos?

Zhou Ji?

Or an ancient beast in human form?

He didn't investigate further; the distance was considerable, and wandering aimlessly in chaos could easily lead to losing one's way.

"Forget it!"

Su Yu didn't dwell on it. Whether it was Zhou Ji or not wasn't important. Besides, who knew how strong Zhou Ji really was? It was known that Hundred Battle King had a son, but who knew if his son was truly formidable?

Perhaps a single slap could end him!

"But that ancient beast, it's not weak, is it at the Heavenly Sovereign level?"

The beast's aura was palpable, but Su Yu didn't pay much attention. In chaos, anything was possible, and the presence of a Heavenly Sovereign wasn't surprising.

Soon, Su Yu arrived near the Death Realm.

He quickly traversed the void, and moments later, his foot landed on solid ground—the Land of the Abyss had arrived!

The Death Realm was eerily quiet now.

Many Dao-merged undead had been slain, and most of the remaining ones had revived. A few Dao-merged undead still guarded various places, while those below the Dao-merged level mostly lacked intelligence. Even if they had some, eternal undead acted purely on instinct.

...

In the Sealed Land.

As Su Yu's figure appeared, the silhouette of the Necromancer Emperor also emerged, looking at Su Yu.

"Su Emperor seeks me?"

Su Yu had deliberately taken a detour to him, so he took the initiative to speak.

Su Yu nodded, "There's been turmoil in the Upper Realm. The Gate of Hell has opened, and two beings of the power of laws level have emerged. Do you know them? One is the Poro Dragon Beast, and the other is Control Qing."

"Poro Dragon..."

The Necromancer Emperor thought for a moment, "I've heard of it, an existence within the Gate of Hell! In the early days of the ancient era, there was turmoil at the Gate of Hell, and an ancient beast claiming to be Poro Dragon tried to break through the gate, but what happened afterward is unknown."

"Control Qing..."

He pondered before saying, "Is she a woman who wields a spear?"

Su Yu nodded, surprised that the Necromancer Emperor actually knew!

The Necromancer Emperor thought for a moment, "Long ago, the Control King visited the Death Realm once. I saw her from afar, and behind the Control King was a spear-wielding woman. I vaguely heard someone call her 'Qing.' Since she's from beyond the Gate of Hell, it might be her!"

He looked at Su Yu, "Under the Control King, there are indeed some powerful beings. Now that they've emerged from the Gate of Hell... could it be that the Control King is behind the Gate of Hell?"

"Possibly!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "Never mind her. My current thought is, I promised to help you break the seal last time, but I'm worried that once unsealed, you'll cause trouble! After all, you're not weak! So, I'll help you break the seal, appoint you as the Necromancer King, and you help me guard the Death Realm. How about that?"

The Necromancer Emperor was silent for a moment, "What if I refuse?"

Su Yu smiled, "That's fine too. Last time, you didn't make a move, and I promised to help you break the seal. I keep my promises! But, once unsealed, if there's any trouble, I'll kill you!"

The Necromancer Emperor was silent for a moment before saying, "I'll consider it."

"Alright!"

Su Yu didn't say much more. The Necromancer Emperor was a smart person, at least smarter than the Martial Emperor.

He knew what choice to make!

...

Soon, Su Yu arrived at the entrance to the seventh level of the Luminous Domain Mansion.

At this moment, the passage was tightly shut.

Su Yu smiled, "Martial Emperor, am I not welcome?"

Silence.

The passage remained closed!

Su Yu smiled, "I'm not here to fight, just to chat. Why refuse someone at the door... or outside your backside?"

The next moment, the Martial Emperor's avatar appeared, filled with anger, coldly looking at Su Yu, "You're provoking this emperor!"

Su Yu smiled, "You're the one who won't open the door, not welcoming me, so I said it!"

The Martial Emperor coldly stared at him, "What do you want this time?"

Su Yu chuckled, "I'm here to visit the Martial Emperor, and by the way, I was thinking, could we discuss cooperation between the Luminous Domain Mansion and the Martial Emperor?"

"Heh!"

The Martial Emperor sneered, "I guessed it. No one offers favors for nothing. You want me to be your henchman? Su Yu, you're dreaming!"

He sneered, "Back then, even the Human Emperor and those guys couldn't make me submit, let alone you, Su Yu!"

"That's why you're in such a miserable state!"

Su Yu was equally blunt, "If you had any brains, with some support, you wouldn't have ended up like this, buried headfirst between the Myriad Realms and the Death Realm! Learn from your mistakes, and yet, after over a hundred thousand years, you haven't gained any wisdom? A hero needs three helpers. Do you really think that after being sealed for over a hundred thousand years, you'll still be a dominant force when you get out? Truly the number one in the world?"

The Martial Emperor's face darkened.

Su Yu continued with a smile, "Those who follow me, Su Yu, have never suffered a loss! If you had been with me back then, and the Martial King treated you like this, I would have stripped him of his pants and hung him in the Myriad Realms, his backside facing the sun!"

"......"

The Martial Emperor's expression was unpleasant. Was Su Yu talking about the Martial King or him?

Su Yu laughed again, "To be frank, you're a typical case of ambition without talent, lacking progress, stubborn and unyielding, a death not worth mourning..."

The Martial Emperor's face turned livid!

Was Su Yu here to recruit him or to pick a fight?

Is this how you win people over?

Su Yu continued, "I'm speaking the truth. It might be harsh, but it's the truth! You're a senior to the Human Emperor and the others, yet you were brought to such a state by a Martial King. The Martial King wasn't even that smart! He beat you not because he was so great, but because he had support!"

Su Yu smiled, "A warrior without support is just a warrior! With support, a warrior becomes a great weapon! You can kill whoever you dislike, and after the killing, someone else will clean up the mess!"

"Su Yu!"

The Martial Emperor suddenly became very angry, "Stop mentioning that word!"

Talking was one thing, but constantly mentioning the backside and staring at his backside—what did that mean?

Su Yu smiled, "The logic is simple. A warrior ruling alone will eventually fail! That's the ultimate truth! If you had read more, studied history, where has a warrior ever ruled long-term? Even if they did, it was because they later studied hard and improved themselves!"

"A pure warrior in power is just a flash in the pan!"

Su Yu laughed, "I won't bother you with all sorts of nonsense. Just a few points: First, when you seek revenge against the Martial King in the future, I'll hold back the Culture King and the Human Emperor. Otherwise... give up on the idea. Do you think you can contend with the Culture King and the Human Emperor?"

The Martial Emperor was silent, his face extremely grim.

Can he contend with them?

Nonsense!

Even before being sealed, he couldn't, let alone after over a hundred thousand years.

He still felt a bit intimidated when he thought of the Culture King.

"Second, I'll find a way to help you reach the Martial King's level... relying on yourself might be hopeless!"

The Martial Emperor's face grew even darker; those words were truly harsh!

"Third, you don't have to call me Your Majesty or Lord. I'm not really interested in subduing you. Let's just consider it mutual assistance. You can call me Su Emperor or Emperor Yu, and I'll call you Martial Emperor... I won't strip you of your emperor title, so we're equals!"

The Martial Emperor's eyes flickered.

"Fourth, I can start working on unsealing you right now!"

"Fifth, you don't have to report everything to me or follow my orders. I only have one request: once I release you and fulfill my promise to help you, you must at least help me kill three beings of the power of laws as repayment!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Think of it as a transaction, not as someone submitting to another! Three Masters of the Rules in exchange for my help in dealing with the Human Emperor and the Culture King. If you think it's worth it, then agree. If not, just let it go!"

The Martial Emperor fell silent.

A transaction?

That sounded much better than submission!

If Su Yu had demanded submission, he would have spat in Su Yu's face. But a transaction... perhaps... it was worth considering?

As he pondered, Su Yu continued, "Use the three Masters of the Rules as your whetstone before you seek revenge against the Martial King. If you can't even kill them, then you might as well give up on revenge and wait for death!"

The Martial Emperor gritted his teeth, "I will kill him eventually!!"

"...Heh!"

The conversation ended with a sneer!

When Su Yu's laughter reached him, the Martial Emperor was furious, "You think I can't kill him?"

"Of course!" Su Yu nodded. "He's with the Culture King. Even if you could kill him, you'd have to deal with the Culture King first. They're inseparable. If you think you can kill the Culture King, then come brag to me!"

"…"

The Martial Emperor was instantly deflated!

Despair!

He couldn't kill the Culture King!

He couldn't even defeat the Martial King, or he would have done so long ago!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was utterly despondent. No one had ever pointed it out before, and he had only fantasized about killing the Martial King. Now, Su Yu had exposed his delusions, leaving him in despair.

Su Yu smiled, "So, you never really thought about revenge, did you? You just fantasized about it. You're a coward. You think that once you're unsealed, the Martial King will remain missing. But let me tell you, you're overthinking it. He'll return sooner or later! And when he does, you'll be in an awkward position!"

The Martial Emperor, both angry and embarrassed, retorted, "I've thought about revenge, always have. I will kill him!"

"Heh! You're just daydreaming. When the time comes, you'll be calling him 'Dad!'"

"You're talking nonsense!"

The Martial Emperor was enraged!

"Isn't Taishan just another way of saying 'father-in-law'? How is that different from calling him 'Dad'?"

Su Yu laughed, "You're clearly afraid of the Martial King and want to acknowledge him as your father!"

"Shut up!"

The Martial Emperor was furious, absolutely denying it!

Su Yu was provoking him.

Yes, it was a provocation, and he wouldn't fall for it!

Su Yu smiled faintly, "Alright, there's no need for impotent rage. Just tell me, do you want revenge or not?"

"Can you handle the Human Emperor and the others?"

The Martial Emperor coldly replied, "You're just boasting!"

Su Yu laughed, "Did you believe me when I said I could kill you before you were unsealed? How about now?"

As he spoke, Su Yu's aura erupted!

It shook the heavens and the earth!

"What about now?"

The Martial Emperor's pupils contracted!

Su Yu said calmly, "Don't use your mindset to judge me! Martial Emperor, you're just a warrior. You don't understand us! If I say I can do it, then I can!"

At this moment, the Martial Emperor was completely silent.

Su Yu had grown stronger again.

He seemed to change every day!

He had only reached the level of a Celestial Sovereign a few days ago, and now, Su Yu seemed on the verge of fully stepping into that realm. Coupled with his own world... at this moment, Su Yu, within his own world, could probably contend with a Master of the Rules!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor felt envy, jealousy, anger, and unwillingness...

All these emotions swirled within him, and finally, he roared, "Did warriors eat your family's food? Su Yu, you have no right to look down on warriors. You are one, and so am I. Are you not a warrior?"

You are too!

What are you pretending to be!

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "See, warriors love to get angry. A true scholar wouldn't get angry. When angered, they must kill and see blood. That's the difference!"

The Martial Emperor was momentarily speechless.

Damn it, it seemed to make some sense, but in his heart, he felt a bit unwilling!

I am unwilling!

After breaking the seal, I said I'd kill you first, and now I'm making a deal with you. What is this?

Su Yu wore a gentle smile, as if he understood his thoughts, and slowly said, "How about this? After you help me kill the three Masters of the Rules, I'll apologize to you in front of the Myriad Realms, saying I shouldn't have humiliated you. Does that give you face? I'm an opener of the heavens!"

The Martial Emperor was stunned. This... didn't seem impossible!
