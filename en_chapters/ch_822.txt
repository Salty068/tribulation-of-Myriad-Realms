Chapter 822: The Myriad Races Flee, Hundred Battle Falls

Moon War was dead.

This quasi-ruler of laws, a being who could rival the ancient Human Emperor in physical prowess, had never gained any advantage since his emergence. As the strongest of the Control King's lineage outside the gate, he had led his faction in hiding for a hundred thousand years. One could say he had done well, but unfortunately, not well enough. In the end, it was the presence of Purple Smoke that exposed him. Or perhaps, he thought the time was ripe to make his move. Yet, what awaited him was death on this day.

The Divine Empress, too, displayed her might today. First, she killed the Old Dragon, then Moon War, fulfilling her promise to Su Yu. She indeed slew Moon War, completing her commitment to Su Yu.

...

In the world.

Su Yu was indifferent.

Whether they lived or died, if the Divine Empress hadn't killed them today, he would have done so sooner or later! In his own world, these people wouldn't leave so easily!

"Strong enough!"

Su Yu watched as the powerful figures continuously shattered his various avatars, and he praised them. The next moment, he laughed heartily, "The Openers of Heaven, who open the world, the era, the myriad paths... But even among the Openers of Heaven, there are differences!"

Su Yu smiled, and then, with a low shout, "I command the heavens and earth, life and death return, execute!"

Boom!

The world exploded, and suddenly, a figure appeared in the heavens and earth, somewhat illusory, with a hint of confusion, suddenly looking at Su Yu. Su Yu shouted, "Xingyue, execute the strong enemy!"

Xingyue was bewildered, and Su Yu pointed at Hundred Battle, "Execute him!"

Xingyue hesitated, and in an instant, death energy erupted, carrying a bit of daze. As the death energy swept towards Hundred Battle, she muttered in extreme confusion, "Where am I?"

"Execute the enemy, shut up!"

"..."

Fine!

Xingyue's phantom instantly erupted with incomparably powerful death energy, covering the heavens and earth. Su Yu reached out and grabbed, and the Undead Emperor suddenly appeared. Su Yu shouted, "Lend me the power of death!"

The Undead Emperor couldn't resist, nor did he resist. The power of death instantly merged into Su Yu's world.

In an instant, Xingyue's aura surged, death energy boiled, and with a loud bang, the death energy covered Hundred Battle in an instant. Hundred Battle groaned, his entire body enveloped by death energy, corroding his flesh!

"I command the heavens and earth, time is with me!"

Su Yu unleashed another force, and in an instant, Xingyue felt her speed increase tenfold, while Hundred Battle's speed was reduced tenfold!

Sizzle!

Countless forces of death corroded Hundred Battle, who let out another low cry, and some of the acupoints in his flesh extinguished instantly.

Su Yu shouted again, "Let your brother lend you strength!"

Xingyue was confused, "Me?"

...

The next moment.

Upstream of the River of Time.

The Human Emperor was still fuming when his expression suddenly changed. In the distance, Xingyue's figure suddenly became illusory, and the power of life and death spread from within her, causing her aura to plummet in an instant.

Just as he was about to speak, he heard Xingyue struggling, "Brother... lend... lend strength..."

The Human Emperor was furious!

"Damn his ancestors!"

He roared in anger, unable to hold back any longer, cursing, "Su Yu, you bastard! Remember this, when I return to the Myriad Realms, I'll kill this bastard first, damn!"

This bastard was forcibly drawing my sister back into his world. Although her true self hadn't returned, the power of the great path had. This wasn't Xingyue controlling his world of life and death; on the contrary, it was Su Yu controlling Xingyue!

Damn!

You occupy my territory, fine. You borrow my great path, fine. But now you're even borrowing my sister, and that's not enough. Now you want to use my sister's body to borrow our strength. Are you even human?

Beast!

Around him, a group of people were also shocked. What was going on?

In the distance, the Radiant King was also astonished, "Your Majesty, is this the Opener of Heaven controlling Xingyue?"

The Human Emperor cursed, and the next moment, exasperated, knowing that time flowed differently, he shouted, "Shut up, hurry, transfer the power of life to Xingyue!"

Bastard!

I'm going to die of anger!

When I return, the first thing I'll do is beat you up. Beating up the Martial Emperor doesn't matter, but I must kill this unscrupulous bastard!

Too much!

It's too much, even borrowing my sister!

Excessive!

And here, a group of rulers of laws, none of them weak, the next moment, a group of rulers of laws exerted their strength, and a stream of life force surged into Xingyue's body, as if being transmitted into the endless river!

...

In Su Yu's world.

Xingyue's body suddenly surged with vitality!

In an instant, the power of life and death grew significantly stronger. In the blink of an eye, the power of life and death fused, transforming into a special force that instantly enveloped Hundred Battle. With a puff, a sword of life and death appeared in Xingyue's hand, piercing through Hundred Battle's flesh and acupoints with one strike!

Su Yu's face was cold as he glanced at Hundred Battle, and soon, his gaze turned to Thunderstorm and the others!

Since he was borrowing power, Su Yu didn't mind borrowing a bit more. Whether the Human Emperor was happy or not... who cares!

These were all messes left by the Human Emperor!

Otherwise, why would I need to go through so much trouble?

Besides, eliminating strong enemies and unifying the Myriad Realms was also to save you. If you don't contribute, how can that be?

Xingyue's appearance stunned the others as well.

Is this even possible?

Su Yu controlled life and death, and at this moment, Xingyue was the bearer of his path of life and death. Naturally, Su Yu could summon his path of life and death to return to his world. There was nothing he couldn't do!

What came wasn't the true self, just a projection of power.

And on Hundred Battle's side, Yu's face had completely changed.

Su Yu!

The Opener of Heaven!

He had too many methods, far more than imagined. Among the Openers of Heaven, the one everyone knew best was the Lord of the Undead, who controlled the path of the undead. The half-baked Human Emperor didn't count.

But the Lord of the Undead, who opened the undead world, only focused on the path of the undead, far from having as many methods as Su Yu!

Su Yu had various ancestors descending, life and death descending, borrowing power from the Human Emperor...

These methods completely refreshed Yu's understanding of the Openers of Heaven!

"The so-called one force subdues ten skills, that's only if you're much stronger than me. Under equal conditions, the path of the flesh is the most basic!"

Su Yu's voice was cold, "I have countless methods. If you can't kill me with one punch, what one force subdues ten skills, it's all nonsense! Do you really think that my understanding of myriad paths is inferior to your understanding of one path? Then why does the world need geniuses? Only fools would say, I specialize in one path to destroy your myriad paths! It's all a joke!"

The path of the flesh is strong, but you haven't reached the point where you can kill me with one punch. I have countless methods, what do you have to compare with me?

One acupoint, one martial skill?

One acupoint, one talent?

Your talent, your martial skill, are inferior to mine!

Su Yu's voice was cold and grand, and the next moment, he reached out and grabbed, and the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger appeared instantly. Su Yu pointed at Thunderstorm and the others, coldly saying, "Kill them! If you continue to dawdle, I'll kill you and merge you into my world!"

The Eight-Winged Tiger and Chaos Dragon couldn't be bothered to argue. Although they had killed some Heavenly Venerables, at this moment, they couldn't afford to provoke this one!

Just do it!

Thunderstorm and the others, Thunderstorm was seriously injured, as was Moon Luo. At this moment, they were also being burned by Su Yu's incarnation of the Demon Ancestor. If they joined, there was still hope to kill the three of them!

In an instant, the two great powerhouses charged at the three of them!

Boom!

A great battle erupted, Thunderstorm and Moon Luo screamed loudly, Moon Howl had already been burned to the bone by the Demon Ancestor, screaming miserably!

The overwhelming demonic flames seemed to be burning the soul!

This scream was like purgatory!

And at this moment, Su Yu was the biggest villain, the biggest antagonist. In everyone's eyes, this guy was the typical villain, the great demon!

Su Yu's bewitching voice rose again, eerily saying, "Yu, kill Hundred Battle, and I'll spare you!"

"Afraid of being schemed by me, then let Hundred Battle self-destruct, blast a crack in my world, and escape!"

"All of you dying, how is that better than you surviving?"

"Yu, you bear the responsibility of the Human Ancestor, how can you fall here?"

"After the Myriad Races kill Control Qing, they will surely come to aid me. Do you think they will aid you?"

"When the five great rulers of laws arrive, you will surely die, with no escape!"

"..."

That bewitching voice echoed in everyone's minds, that hypnotic voice made Yu feel a bit dazed. What Su Yu said seemed very right.

If this continues, I will die!

Hundred Battle, this waste, dragged me back when I could have escaped, and now if this continues, with Su Yu having more methods, she will surely die!

Su Yu's bewitching voice rose again, "Thunderstorm, Moon Luo, whose subordinates are you? Who do you want to save? Leave a strong one to stop me from killing the enemy, assist the other in escaping... self-destruct! Self-destruct, you can assist one in escaping, break my world, open a crack, the crack is right in front of you..."

He was like a devil!

That devilish whisper made one's heart cold!

...

Below.

The newly integrated powerhouses like Wu Ji couldn't help but swallow, frightened.

The feeling Su Yu gave them... was too evil!

A terrifying existence!

Even Red Moon couldn't help but transmit to the Great Zhou King, "Has he... always been like this?"

Aren't you afraid to work with this person?

Too terrifying!

The Great Zhou King gave them a meaningful look but said nothing.

Su Yu was indeed sinister, truly sinister, but he wasn't always like this. However, there were times when he treated enemies, killing wasn't enough, he focused on breaking hearts!

This guy could talk, could fight, could plan and decide.

It must be said, the Great Zhou King wasn't as afraid of the Human Emperor, more respect and admiration, but towards Su Yu... there was a bit of fear. This guy, when angry, was scarier than the Human Emperor.

Not in strength, but in aura!

The Human Emperor was still a benevolent person, perhaps he could be called the Benevolent Emperor, but Su Yu wasn't as benevolent as the Human Emperor.

At this moment, everyone said nothing.

They just watched silently!

In the midst of the chaotic battlefield, Su Yu's voice rang out, calm yet commanding, "Great Xia King, Great Qin King, have you forgotten my previous words? If the Myriad Races continue to delay, and five against two can't secure a victory, what are you waiting for? Are you afraid that if we kill too many, they will turn against us? Do you think I fear their retaliation?"

At these words, Tiangu and the others' expressions changed drastically. Previously, the Great Qin King and others had indeed hesitated to slaughter the enemy, worried that Su Yu, facing powerful foes, might provoke a backlash from the Myriad Races. But with Su Yu's reminder, the Great Qin King's face shifted, and he shouted, "Generals, kill the enemy!"

Su Yu's cold gaze swept towards the Myriad Races. Tiangu's face turned pale, and he roared, "Kill! Quickly, kill!"

Hurry!

Su Yu had laid it bare: he wasn't afraid of their retaliation. Whether it was a bluff or genuine fearlessness, Tiangu didn't want to gamble on it. In an instant, five rulers of laws, along with Yuan Sheng and Tiangu—who had now stepped into the Heavenly Venerable level—joined forces with two other powerful beings to besiege Mo Tianzun.

The Divine Empress, Saint Marquis, and Huang joined forces to attack Yu Qing. It was a frenzy. They had to kill quickly, or Su Yu would unleash another massacre.

"Such stubborn fools!" Su Yu's face was icy. As for the Myriad Races turning against him... if it weren't for Tiangu's leadership, he might have been worried. But with Tiangu, who always overthought things, he wasn't concerned. Tiangu, despite his wisdom and methods, lacked decisiveness as a leader. He had been intimidated by Su Yu multiple times, making the likelihood of him turning against Su Yu very low.

Meanwhile, Mo Tianzun was being severely injured, a look of helplessness and sorrow on his face. The Demon Race had chosen the wrong side. Truly, they had erred. Yu Qing and the others, the Hundred Battle King, none of them were reliable!

At that moment, Mo Tianzun suddenly pleaded, sending a message to Tiangu, "I was wrong. I shouldn't have betrayed the Myriad Races... but I was following the orders of the Flame Demon Emperor of my Demon Race... Brother Tiangu... I've become a ruler of laws... I can join you..."

Tiangu's eyes flickered. Mo Tianzun! He didn't particularly care about Mo Tianzun, but if they were truly going to the Gate of Hell... the Demon Race might be useful. The Flame Demon Emperor of the Demon Race was rumored to be within the Gate of Hell. Mo Tianzun's collusion with Yu Qing and the others might mean he knew more. Upon entering, Tiangu and the others would be blind, but Mo Tianzun might have some knowledge.

Tiangu quickly considered and suddenly sent a message, "Later, if you turn against Yu Qing and kill her, I can... try!"

He didn't promise because he had no authority to do so. But he could try to negotiate with Su Yu. In Su Yu's eyes, Mo Tianzun probably wasn't worth much, even if he had become a ruler of laws.

If Mo Tianzun killed Yu Qing... it would mean a complete break with the lineage of the Control King. Of course, evidence of this would need to be preserved! After entering the Gate of Hell, it could be used to intimidate Mo Tianzun, as the Control King was within the Gate of Hell!

Mo Tianzun's face changed, "Brother, do you mean... if Su Yu wants to kill me... even if I deal with Yu Qing, it would be futile?"

"Yes! If you're willing, try it. If not... you can only die!"

Mo Tianzun felt a heavy weight. Once, the allegiance of a ruler of laws required Su Yu's approval! But the situation was stronger than the person. At this point, even Tiangu and the others dared not resist, let alone himself.

Mo Tianzun fell silent. Amidst the ongoing battle, he inadvertently moved closer to Yu Qing. Yu Qing was indeed stronger than the other rulers of laws, wielding a spear that swept across the battlefield. The Divine Empress had attacked several times, consuming much energy. Saint Marquis and Huang were also heavily drained, and despite their recent advancement, the three rulers of laws couldn't take down Yu Qing in a short time.

At this moment, Mo Tianzun shouted, "Regroup... or if I'm killed, you won't escape death either..."

Yu Qing didn't want to bring Mo Tianzun along, as it would increase the pressure. But as Mo Tianzun said, without him, she'd face five rulers of laws and two Heavenly Venerables alone. Reluctantly, Yu Qing swept her spear, unleashing a powerful attack that sent Huang Tianzun flying. She quickly regrouped with Mo Tianzun, sending a message, "Retreat, we must retreat! Retreat to the Gate of Hell... the Hundred Battle King likely can't match Su Yu..."

Retreat!

Though it had been difficult to emerge, returning now left her unwilling, but it was better than dying here. Mo Tianzun's eyes flickered, and he nodded. In the next moment, his purple hair fluttered, and a dark demonic force surged from his palm, striking towards Yu Qing!

Yu Qing was startled, turning her head to see a spear sweeping towards her! But with Mo Tianzun's sudden betrayal and the combined assault of the five rulers of laws, she had no chance to resist. Her face twisted in anger, and she roared, "Fool, the Flame Demon Emperor of your race is right behind the gate... you..."

You betray the Myriad Races, then the Saint Race, flip-flopping, do you think you'll have a good end? If I die, you'll die sooner or later! I told you to retreat to the gate, yet you still betray, you fool, you'll die sooner or later!

Mo Tianzun remained silent. He knew that his constant betrayal wasn't a good idea and wouldn't end well. But he showed a sorrowful expression, "You can abandon the Control King's lineage... I... cannot ignore the Demon Race!"

You take me to retreat, but it's just the two of us! What about the billions of demons in the lower realm? The demons in the upper realm are now in the Control King's domain. You can ignore them, but I can't. My betrayals are just my own!

"As Yue Zhan said... you all... don't actually care about the Saint Race... the so-called Saint Race... is just a joke!"

Mo Tianzun was filled with bitterness. Retreat? Retreat alone, and create a race with the Flame Demon behind the gate? Ridiculous! What is a race? It's the foundation, the faith, the home, the nation, the emotion, the power, the fame, the profit... Without these, what do you have left? Nothing!

The so-called struggle for the Dao, what does it have to do with us? That's too high-level! Too distant from them, do you understand?

Boom!

Six rulers of laws, two Heavenly Venerables, attacked simultaneously. Even though Yu Qing was strong, she was just a relatively strong fourth-tier ruler of laws, not an absolute powerhouse. With a loud explosion, her body shattered into pieces! Her spear broke! The power of chaos erupted, exploding into a massive mushroom cloud!

From her body, a spherical object flew out, attempting to escape. At this moment, the Chaos Dragon suddenly bit down on Yue Xiao, shouting indistinctly, "Emperor Yu, that's the will of chaos... we can't let it escape, it can bring back the beings from the Gate of Hell..."

With a crunch, Yue Xiao was bitten into pieces. The Chaos Dragon wanted to rush over and snatch that thing! He wanted it badly! But he didn't dare move. The Eight-Winged Tiger felt the same! He wanted it too!

At this moment, on Tiangu's side, several strong figures quickly acted, capturing the sphere. The sphere struggled violently. Simultaneously, from the depths of chaos, within the Gate of Hell, a grand voice suddenly echoed, "How dare you kill Sister Qing..."

Before the words were finished, Su Yu, who had been controlling the heavens and earth, suddenly roared in anger, veins bulging. He raised his hand and pulled out a mountain from the heavens and earth, transforming it into a long blade. The gigantic Su Yu wielded it like a massive sword, slashing towards the Gate of Hell!

"Screw you!"

Boom!

With this thunderous sound, the three realms trembled! The Chaos Mountain region exploded! In the void, the shadow of the Gate of Hell was shattered by Su Yu's mountain, "Tongtian!"

With a hum, Marquis Tongtian teleported over, swallowing the shattered shadow entirely! Su Yu's face was cold, "Hiding like cowards, can't even come out, yet dare to shout at me!"

He casually tossed the mountain aside, and with a rumbling sound, it landed, causing countless casualties among the Myriad Races! Tiangu and the others were furious, but helpless.

Su Yu said coldly, "Hand over the item!" Tiangu wanted to say something, but Su Yu casually tossed a massive sphere, "Your lives in the lower realm, hurry, if you don't hand it over, then kill Mo Tianzun, I can do without it!"

At these words, Mo Tianzun's face changed. Su Yu said coldly, "I know you might have guessed my intentions. While I haven't dealt with the Hundred Battle King yet, and just shattered that willpower with a single strike, leaving no one to witness this... you should take your people and leave now! Don't force me to change my mind!"

Tiangu's face shifted, and he nodded. The Divine Empress quickly threw the chaotic will towards Su Yu, while Tiangu shouted, "Go, take everyone from the mountain, hurry! Evacuate immediately!"

Evacuate the Myriad Realms! The Myriad Realms were no longer theirs; they had to leave this place! After ten thousand years of struggle, in the end, they could only choose to leave!

Quickly, the rulers of laws gathered everything, taking the remaining people from the mountain into their weapon spaces. They had to leave swiftly, taking advantage of the moment when Su Yu shattered the shadow of the Gate of Hell, ensuring a more secure departure. Otherwise, someone behind the Gate of Hell might be watching them.

Su Yu was truly terrifying! He had even calculated this for them! Su Yu hadn't acted himself... perhaps to force them to leave quickly, so he could focus on dealing with the Hundred Battle King. Otherwise, he feared they might rebel!

Yes, that was indeed the case! Until now, Su Yu hadn't personally entered the fray! He was worried about this very point! Concerned that if he went all out against the Hundred Battle King, Tiangu and the others might intervene, putting him in great danger. But now, he gave the Myriad Races a chance to evacuate early. Whether they left or not was up to them!

He reached out and grabbed the chaotic will.

The Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon were practically drooling!

But at this moment, Su Yu simply put it away, showing no intention of giving it to them. The two ancient beasts wore expressions of despair. Were they not going to get it?

How tragic!

They wanted it so badly!

At this moment, Hundred Battle suddenly roared, "You're planning to retreat behind the Gate of Hell? It's extremely dangerous there. Instead of that, why not fight to the death..."

He understood Su Yu's intentions!

Su Yu, just to be safe, was willing to let the myriad races escape, but he was determined to kill them!

This meant that, in Su Yu's eyes, they were more deserving of death than the myriad races!

And Su Yu, at this moment, didn't bother to hide his intentions, speaking coldly, "Three minutes! If the myriad races haven't retreated in three minutes..."

"Retreat!"

Tiangu didn't even give him a chance to finish speaking. He quickly gathered everything, leaving behind only some resources and people, abandoning the rest!

He roared, interrupting Su Yu, and then turned to look at him, saying solemnly, "The mountains are high and the road is long. This time, we have lost! Emperor Yu, if we ever have the chance to return to the Myriad Realms... then... we will learn from your high skills again!"

Su Yu sneered, "You? If you can avoid coming back, I suggest you don't... Besides, you won't have the chance! If I win, I will definitely break into the Gate of Hell! Do you think I'm the kind of person who waits for you to attack my base? Wait for me! When I reach the Gate of Hell, you'll be my vanguard! Make sure to scout the area, list all the enemies I need to kill, and prepare all the information. If I'm in a good mood, I might spare you!"

Arrogant!

Arrogant to the extreme!

He intended to break in, not wait for them to break out.

But thinking back... Su Yu had always been like this.

He never waited for others to invade the Human Realm; he attacked the Myriad Realms first. He didn't wait for the Upper Realm to descend; he fought his way up from the Lower Realm to the Upper Realm!

He was always proactive!

Never passive!

He even wanted to fight upstream, to break into the Gate of Hell!

Tiangu felt bitter!

Perhaps... it really would be like that.

"Then... farewell!"

At Tiangu's command, the rulers of laws quickly gathered everything. The rulers of laws were not slow, and soon, a group of them gathered and swiftly flew towards the Gate of Hell!

Soon, they arrived at a portal, but at this moment, the Gate of Hell no longer had its previous oppressive aura, as its phantom had been shattered by Su Yu's attack.

And Marquis Tongtian was there.

At this moment, his eyes were bright, and he was smiling broadly, "Are you all leaving? I wish you a safe journey. I'll open a passage for you. While this gate hasn't awakened, and its bit of revived will was shattered by His Majesty, I'll smuggle you in..."

Tiangu's expression changed, "No need!"

"Motian, how do we get in?"

He didn't dare let Marquis Tongtian send them in; that was too terrifying!

Motian Zun's expression also changed slightly, and he quickly said, "I'm not sure about the specifics, but I know one method... Use the blood of the Control King's lineage to carve a teleportation array, and we can teleport in!"

Tiangu's eyes turned sharp, "Go, kill all the Sun and Moon realm experts of the Sin Race, and use their blood to teleport us!"

Motian Zun's expression changed, and Tiangu shouted, "Go!"

Motian Zun gritted his teeth, nodded, and quickly disappeared. Soon, from the distant valley surrounded by mountains, came a series of heart-wrenching screams.

In less than a minute, Motian Zun returned, covered in blood, extracting a mass of blood essence power, and quickly began carving something on the gate. Tiangu remained silent.

Soon, a special power emanated from behind the gate.

Tiangu turned back once more, looking at the ever-smiling Marquis Tongtian, and sighed, "Ten thousand years of struggle, all turned to dust in a day! Encountering Emperor Yu in this life, perhaps... is my fortune, but also the sorrow of my myriad races!"

"Farewell... perhaps... never again!"

"Go!"

With a low shout, several powerful figures quickly disappeared into the portal!

The blood-constructed teleportation array shattered instantly!

Ten thousand years!

The ancients disappeared for ten thousand years, from the first tide to the tenth tide. On the side of the myriad races, six rulers of laws and two Heavenly Venerables, along with the remaining strong experts of the myriad races and their clansmen, retreated from the Myriad Realms!

Defeated, with no path to choose!

What awaited them was only the unknown.

This journey, perhaps they would never return!

Until the last moment, Tiangu didn't dare to lead the strong experts of the myriad races to attack Su Yu. He... didn't dare to gamble.

...

At this moment, Su Yu laughed!

The myriad races had left!

The six rulers of laws had all left!

Today, Yuying, Polong, Yue Zhan, Changqing, Changmei, and Yue Xiao were all killed. With the myriad races gone, at this moment, only these enemies remained before him!

And at this time, both Yu and Hundred Battle had completely lost their color!

The myriad races had fled!

They fled directly behind the gate, even though it was extremely dangerous, they were unwilling to contend with Su Yu!

Su Yu had scared the myriad races out of their wits!

But the myriad races, at least, left behind six rulers of laws. Even if they entered the Gate of Hell, it didn't mean they had no fighting power left. However, for these few people, it seemed to be the end!

Su Yu smiled, "Any more tricks up your sleeve? Can Zhou Ji kill the Martial Emperor and come over sooner?"

"Hundred Battle, your wife came out, your son was stopped, why not call your father out, or call the Human Ancestor?"

Hundred Battle's face was grim!

Su Yu twisted his neck and smiled, "Since they've all left, let's play a little. Xingyue, go kill that big ugly woman, I'll personally deal with Hundred Battle. As they say, a true king meets a false king, a true emperor meets a false king, naturally... I'll personally execute him!"

With that, he threw a punch!

Hundred Battle also let out a low roar, throwing a punch, boom!

A loud explosion!

Su Yu stood firm, while Hundred Battle staggered back several steps, his hands covered in blood!

"Hundred Battle, I will beat you to death with my fists, to show you that overwhelming strength is the declaration of the strong over the weak!"

Su Yu stepped forward in the air, throwing another punch!

Boom!

A phantom appeared on Hundred Battle's body, but it was shattered by Su Yu's punch, followed by the explosion of an aperture on his body!

"Too weak!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, "Not enough!"

He threw another punch, and Hundred Battle roared, all his apertures bursting with dazzling light, boom!

Su Yu also erupted with 720 apertures, but his physical body and willpower sea were half and half!

The power of this punch was still stronger than Hundred Battle's!

"Collapse, break, shatter..."

With this punch, characters appeared, rules and great paths manifested!

Boom!

Hundred Battle flew backward, his body drenched in blood, his great path trembling, apertures exploding, his hair disheveled, and his crown knocked off by Su Yu's punch, now trampled under Su Yu's foot!

Su Yu stomped down, shattering the crown into pieces, and said indifferently, "What kind of king are you?"

What kind of king are you?

You're nothing!

Hundred Battle, hair disheveled, quickly got up, his arms covered in cracks, blood flowing!

"Su Yu..."

He looked at Su Yu, his eyes filled with complexity, "You... won't even give me a shred of dignity in the end?"

Su Yu was indifferent, "You're not qualified! Dignity is earned! I'd rather leave a bit of dignity for a weakling like Tiangu than leave you any face!"

When Tiangu left, Su Yu even saw him off.

Hundred Battle, he gave him no face!

Hundred Battle laughed bitterly, "So... in your eyes, I'm really so worthless?"

Boom!

Su Yu threw another punch!

"We've talked enough, the outsiders are gone, traitors of our own, we deal with ourselves, there's nothing more to say!"

Earlier, Su Yu was willing to chat with him a bit, to convict him.

Now, with the myriad races gone, he couldn't be bothered to say anything.

One punch, two punches, three punches...

Each punch carried various powers of the great path, each punch landing, leaving Hundred Battle's flesh and blood in tatters, forcing him back continuously!

At this moment, a fierce roar sounded.

"Escape!"

Boom!

A thunderous explosion sounded behind Su Yu, a loud roar, and Thunderstorm exploded into pieces, his remaining willpower drifting between heaven and earth, vaguely looking at Su Yu, seemingly pleading!

Su Yu was surprised, "You're not saving Yu, but going to save Hundred Battle? Are you crazy!"

If you're going to self-destruct, just do it!

Su Yu's world seemed to have a small crack, and at this moment, over there, Yue Luo also let out a fierce roar, crazily charging towards Su Yu like a moth to a flame!

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, looking at Hundred Battle, "Not bad! You're not entirely useless, at least someone is willing to die for you, but you... seem to have let them down!"

Hundred Battle's face was filled with sorrow!

Yes!

I have let them down!

"Su Yu!"

Hundred Battle chuckled lightly, suddenly becoming much more composed, "Perhaps, I really am a waste, but even a waste has some redeeming qualities... maybe... I'm not as worthless as you say..."

Su Yu silently watched him, and Hundred Battle's aura suddenly grew much stronger, laughing softly, "I may not be as good as you... my son... is stronger than me..."

Su Yu was taken aback, then suddenly laughed, "Damn! You're actually counting on your son? A person who doesn't rely on himself, always thinking of relying on his son or his wife, or maybe a mistress... you're really a waste!"

Hundred Battle didn't mind, laughing, "Maybe you're right, but my son... is truly better than me! Su Yu, maybe, he is your true rival, I... can't match you, nor am I as good as you!"

At this moment, his blood and qi suddenly surged, his aura incredibly powerful, and he threw a punch at Su Yu, this punch actually forcing Su Yu to retreat, while the remaining apertures on his body began to explode!

Hundred Battle's golden armor appeared, the crown reappeared, with a hint of a smile, "Fight again!"

He actively pressed towards Su Yu, throwing a punch, using all sorts of methods, but the apertures continued to explode, blood marks appearing all over his body, punch after punch!

At this moment, Hundred Battle was incredibly brave!

Hundred Battle, to be king!

Without battle, how can one be king?

Changmei was right!

How can I avoid battle?

Su Yu unleashed a flurry of punches, fighting with his life on the line, and managed to suppress his opponent, forcing him to retreat step by step. Though his time was limited, he still wanted to shine brilliantly one last time.

At that moment, Su Yu suddenly grew furious!

"You dare to risk your life, and you think I won't? Do you think I'm like you?"

"Burn!"

With a furious roar, his blood and the power of his dao ignited, causing his aura to surge dramatically, leaving Hundred Battle King dumbfounded. In this situation, Su Yu could have waited for a moment, allowing his opponent to burn out and die in a final blaze of glory. But he refused!

Su Yu coldly declared, "Retreat once, and you'll retreat every time! Moreover, I don't want a traitor to have any so-called final glory. You might as well die in misery!"

Boom!

The power of the dao burned, and Su Yu, this madman, wouldn't even let someone die gloriously!

"Open the Heavens!"

With a slash, the blade's dao manifested, dimming the heavens and earth!

The blade's light reflected across the Myriad Realms!

"Expand the Spirit!"

With a hammer strike, the heavens crumbled, mountains shattered, and chaos dissipated!

The Hundred Battle King, who had just shown a moment of bravery, was utterly devastated by Su Yu's equally desperate assault. In the blink of an eye, his golden armor shattered, his crown broke again, his body crumbled, and even his acupoints were destroyed!

Su Yu was indeed a madman!

Those who knew him understood that he was a madman!

Hundred Battle King was clearly doomed!

Su Yu only needed to wait a little longer, without paying any price, and the Hundred Battle King would have killed himself. Of course, in his final moment, he would have suppressed Su Yu to the point of immobility.

But... Su Yu refused!

Why should he?

Why should I let you have your way?

Paying a price? Can I, Su Yu, not afford it?

I want you to fall in your final moments of misery!

No dignity for you!

"Slash, Break, Destroy!"

Another slash, and with a squelch, the Hundred Battle King's arm was severed.

Another slash, and his legs were cut off. With a thunderous kick, Su Yu sent him flying, dragging a long trail of blood through the void!

Below, even the Great Zhou King and others felt a chill watching this!

Su Yu was truly ruthless!

He wouldn't even leave the Hundred Battle King with a shred of dignity in death.

He wanted to shatter everything about him!

Wu Ji and the others wore heavy expressions. After all, they had followed the Hundred Battle King for many years. At this moment, Wu Ji's face shifted, and he suddenly knelt on one knee, his voice booming, "Your Majesty Emperor Yu, the Hundred Battle King... was after all the Ninth Generation Human Lord. Please, Emperor Yu, grant him a final dignity!"

Even in death, he shouldn't die like this, too wretched!

Su Yu stopped, looking at the Hundred Battle King opposite him, and said indifferently, "Your subordinates are pleading for you! I, Su Yu, am not without compassion. Kill yourself! It's better than being tortured to death by me! If you don't, I will torture you to death!"

The Hundred Battle King smiled bitterly, coughing up blood, and nodded slightly, "Thank you..."

He looked at Wu Ji and the others, with some apology, "Thank you! I'm sorry... I... thank you... for leaving me some dignity..."

With those words, he stopped struggling, and his dao suddenly began to collapse!

Suicide!

Yes, he chose to commit suicide. Su Yu was no ordinary person; he was too ruthless. He wouldn't leave the Hundred Battle King with any final dignity. If Wu Ji and the others hadn't knelt, he wouldn't even have left him the chance to commit suicide!

This was truly ruthless!

Throughout his life, the Hundred Battle King had encountered many powerful opponents, but few like Su Yu, who would make sure you died in disgrace, even in death!

At this moment, the Hundred Battle King severed his own dao.

His body began to collapse!

He couldn't defeat Su Yu, even if he erupted again, he couldn't win!

In that case... fighting would only lead to a disgraceful death!

"Your Majesty!"

At this moment, a sorrowful voice came, and just as Su Yu was about to turn and strike, Yue Luo suddenly self-destructed her dao, looking at Su Yu with a pleading expression, "Please, let me send His Majesty off!"

She bowed to Su Yu, who frowned slightly.

Yue Luo smiled sadly, "Please, Emperor Yu, grant me this once... I know Emperor Yu dislikes me..."

Su Yu frowned slightly and said indifferently, "Go ahead!"

Yue Luo revealed a bright smile!

Her attire suddenly changed, showing a pitiful look as she gazed at the Hundred Battle King, softly saying, "Your Majesty!"

The Hundred Battle King's eyes were clouded, looking at her with a hint of sorrow.

"Your Majesty!"

Yue Luo walked towards him step by step, showing a tender expression, "It was... my mistake! I shouldn't have followed Yu's orders and deliberately led Your Majesty to the Giant Race! In my eyes, Your Majesty will always be the Ninth Tide, the overlord who swept the world!"

"Your Majesty... let me send you off one last time... I only hope... there is a next life..."

The Hundred Battle King showed a faint smile, nodding slightly, and suddenly stepped forward to hold her hand, smiling, "You said... you wanted to see the Myriad Realms... from the sky, I... will take you to see..."

He didn't even glance at Yu, holding Yue Luo's hand, flying towards the sky, higher and higher!

Higher and higher!

Their figures gradually dissipated, and Yue Luo also gradually dissipated. The Hundred Battle King's voice came, with some relief, some joy, "I probably really wasn't fit to be a king... Over six thousand years ago, I should have taken Yue Luo and retired... maybe, none of this would have happened today... Su Yu... thank you!"

Thank you, Su Yu, for giving him a chance in the end.

Su Yu watched them dissipate silently, with some indifference. Don't be polite, if your grandson hadn't scattered the power of the dao into my world at the last moment, I wouldn't have let you die in peace!

The Hundred Battle King knew Su Yu was ruthless!

So in the end, to leave himself some dignity, he chose to integrate a large amount of the power of the physical dao into Su Yu's world.

That was the key reason Su Yu didn't stop them!

Otherwise, if you two were having some life-and-death romance at the end, believe it or not, Su Yu would have punched them into oblivion!

That ruthless!

The Hundred Battle King knew, and Yue Luo knew, so in the end, they both chose to sever their own dao, leaving the power of the dao in Su Yu's world!

Until this moment, almost all the enemies were dead!

In the entire world, only three people remained.

Su Yu, Xingyue's shadow, and Yu!

In one battle, Su Yu had killed all the powerful enemies, forcing the Myriad Races to flee into the Gate of Hell. At this moment, only the powerful Yu remained alive, and not only alive, this woman was truly fierce, even causing Xingyue's shadow to dissipate!

But with the Hundred Battle King's fall, Yu's expression turned completely grim.

The Hundred Battle King... was dead!

If he had self-destructed at the last moment, he might have blown open Su Yu's world, but he didn't. Instead, he chose to sever his own dao, just to seek that moment of peace, flying away with Yue Luo!

"Useless!"

Yu snorted coldly, with some anger and frustration!

A great situation, ruined by the Hundred Battle King!

Otherwise, she and the Hundred Battle King would have escaped long ago!

Rumble!

At this moment, the Myriad Realms trembled, and with the Hundred Battle King's death and the Myriad Races' retreat, the fortune of the entire Myriad Realms converged towards Su Yu's world!

And Yu also clearly felt that Su Yu was still growing stronger!

At this rate, she might not escape death either!

Su Yu smiled, looking at her, then at the dissipating Hundred Battle King and Yue Luo in the void, and sighed, "Your man... betrayed you, how pitiful!"

Yu replied coldly, "Betrayal is betrayal, such a useless person deserves to die!"

"Truly pathetic... you should have said that before he died!"

Su Yu laughed!

Yu was quite strong, not easy to kill!

Also, Zhou Ji still hadn't arrived, which was unexpected?

Your father is dead, your mother is about to die, if you don't show up soon, I'll have to find a way to kill your mother!
