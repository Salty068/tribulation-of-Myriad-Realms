Chapter 689: The Amiable Su Yu (Only One Chapter Today)

Inside the Emperor Yu Hall.

Su Yu chuckled for a moment, and once he regained his composure, he said, "Please, have a seat and let's talk. No need to be too formal. Guests from the Upper Realm are all esteemed seniors."

His demeanor was quite courteous, yet the more polite he was, the more intimidating it felt.

The four visitors glanced at the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng, who said nothing, each taking a seat on either side. In the next moment, a cup of tea appeared before each of them, and they began to drink in unison.

Their actions were remarkably synchronized!

Both were seasoned veterans, accustomed to sipping tea and listening during meetings. Wan Tiansheng always carried a large tea mug to meetings, and the Great Zhou King was much the same. Both were scholars, not fond of heated arguments.

Seeing this, the four visitors dared not object and reluctantly took their seats.

Su Yu smiled and said, "Let's start with a brief overview of the situation in the Upper Realm, and your requests. Are there any instructions from the Upper Realm? Please share information about the various races and any basic details."

He continued, "How should I address you all?"

The four quickly introduced themselves: "Zhao Chuan," "Ping Yao," "Zhou Nan," and "Zhang Hong."

Among them, Zhao Chuan appeared to be the eldest, while the woman introduced herself as Ping Yao. Su Yu didn't pay much attention to the other two.

All four were quite powerful. In the past, they would have been considered overlords if they descended to the lower realm.

All were in the Eternal Realm!

Zhao Chuan possessed the power of the seventh stage, while the other three were mid-stage Eternals. There were no low-stage Eternals present, likely because they had perished.

It was a decent force!

Previously, Su Yu had thought there were few people left in the Upper Realm, with most being in the Daofuse Realm. But now it seemed there were still quite a few Eternals.

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Zhao Chuan, seeing Su Yu's nod, secretly breathed a sigh of relief and quickly said, "Reporting to the lord, we all serve under the Human Lord's subordinate, Marquis Dingjun! For thousands of years, the human experts in the Upper Realm have struggled to survive, preserving the spark of humanity for a resurgence. Countless experts have fallen! Currently, there are six human factions in the Upper Realm!"

"The Marquis of Zhennan, hiding in Tiankuling!"

"The Marquis of Yunshui, hiding in Fuchen River."

"The Marquis of Huoyun, hiding in Shenhuo Mountain."

"General Yingwu, temporarily residing in Yixian Gorge, and our own Marquis Dingjun."

Only five factions.

Su Yu looked at him, and Zhao Chuan quickly added, "There is also a lone ranger, the Shadow Marquis! He has no fixed abode and specializes in ambushes. Previously, there was the strongest faction led by Marquis Minshan, but something happened to him... His human faction has been annihilated."

Five marquises and one general, likely all advanced to the Daofuse Realm.

This was the current situation in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry to ask about other matters and instead smiled, "Among these six, how many are women?"

"…"

Zhao Chuan was puzzled but didn't dare to question further. He quickly replied, "The Marquis of Yunshui and General Yingwu are both women. As for the Shadow Marquis, I'm not sure, as I've never met them."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "So, there are six Daofuse experts?"

"For now, that's all we know."

Zhao Chuan continued, "Since everyone is in hiding, some might be completely concealed, waiting for the Upper Realm to open. Even Marquis Dingjun doesn't know if there are others alive. We only know about those who are still active and occasionally launch counterattacks."

Beside him, the Great Zhou King sighed.

Only six left!

In the last tide, there were seventy to eighty human Daofuse experts, and now only six remain. Truly, not even one in ten survived!

The Great Zhou King saw Su Yu looking at him and sighed, "It's quite emotional. Emperor Yu, may I ask a few questions?"

"Please, Great Zhou King."

The Great Zhou King turned to Zhao Chuan, "These survivors are from the last tide. In these thousands of years, have no new Daofuse experts emerged? The lower realm is sealed, but the Upper Realm isn't, and there's no need for slumber. Has no new Daofuse emerged?"

Zhao Chuan also sighed, "We haven't heard of any. The myriad races' pursuit is relentless. We've been constantly on the run, and battles are frequent. Talented experts are prime targets for the myriad races! Coupled with insufficient resources, and in the Upper Realm, the power of the Great Dao is evident. If one advances to Daofuse, the myriad races, being numerous, quickly notice and pursue them..."

Only six Daofuse factions, constantly in hiding.

Six would have been astonishing in the past, but now… Su Yu had killed six just today!

Too few!

Su Yu smiled, "How many Daofuse experts do the myriad races have?"

"That…"

Zhao Chuan thought for a moment and said, "We don't have precise numbers, but there are probably seventy or eighty! While the humans haven't produced new Daofuse experts, the myriad races have, as they are powerful and control the resources of the Upper Realm, allowing new Daofuse to emerge."

"Seventy or eighty Daofuse, and they haven't wiped you out?"

Su Yu was puzzled. Were the myriad races so incompetent?

After so many years, and they didn't even slumber.

Zhao Chuan explained, "The Upper Realm is vast, with many dangerous areas! As long as humans don't stay in one place too long and keep delving into various perilous areas, it's actually difficult for the myriad races to pursue us! Often, killing one human results in the loss of two or even three of their own!"

"After the ninth tide ended, the first millennium was filled with relentless pursuit. At that time, there were a dozen or so human Daofuse who fled to the Upper Realm. Marquis Minshan and several others were very powerful and launched counterattacks… Battles were constant back then. Later, when several top human experts died, Marquis Minshan ordered everyone to disperse and hide, breaking into smaller groups to make it harder for the myriad races to encircle us!"

Zhao Chuan quickly added, "Since then, the intensity of the myriad races' encirclement has decreased significantly. Moreover, the myriad races aren't a monolith. The Upper Realm has treasures, many treasures, especially some Great Dao rules…"

He feared Su Yu might not understand and explained, "The Upper Realm contains some unclaimed rule-based Great Dao! Some are broken, some are complete. It's said that obtaining an unclaimed rule-based Great Dao offers hope of becoming a ruler of rules! So, while pursuing humans, the myriad races are also seizing these treasures."

"With fewer and fewer human experts, the myriad races have shifted their focus to competing among themselves!"

Only a few human Daofuse remain, and they are well-hidden.

The myriad races' strategy is simple: instead of searching bit by bit, they wait for the lower realm to open. Surely, the ancient human experts won't stand by and watch humanity perish?

Tiangu and the others didn't annihilate humanity earlier, partly due to this reasoning.

They didn't want to wipe out humanity completely, only for the ancient human experts to come down and oppose them.

Thus, the people in the Upper Realm have played a role in preventing humanity's early extinction. Humans are essentially bait.

"Are there any rulers of rules in the Upper Realm?"

"No!"

Zhao Chuan shook his head, "It's said that a few ancient experts might be close to that level, but there are no rulers of rules. If there were, they would have appeared long ago! Now, these experts mostly remain in seclusion, rarely appearing! They are all focused on reaching that level!"

He continued, "According to some in the Upper Realm, this era makes it difficult for rulers of rules to emerge, mainly due to the lack of certain necessary elements…"

Seeing Su Yu's gaze, he shook his head, "I don't know the specifics. However, in ancient times, so many rulers of rules emerged. It's unreasonable that none have emerged over so many years! Rulers of rules are incredibly powerful, yet in ancient times, over a hundred appeared in a short period. Many surviving individuals were marquises in ancient times. To be conferred as a marquis, one had to be a strong expert in ancient times. It's been ten thousand years, so why haven't they advanced?"

Su Yu pondered. The ancient experts in the Upper Realm might have discovered something.

Indeed, after ten thousand years, those Daofuse experts from back then couldn't all have merged with others' Daos, right?

If they had, the original owners couldn't all still be alive, could they?

So why hasn't a single one emerged over so many years?

Did the Human Emperor and others do something?

Su Yu could only speculate along these lines, and Zhao Chuan added, "It's said it might be related to the River of Time. Actually, the lack of rulers of rules has been the case for many years. After the ancient sealing of the world, it seems it became impossible!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "So, there are no rulers of rules in the Upper Realm, but there should be some experts close to that level."

"There are!"

Su Yu smiled, "I'm curious about one thing. Besides Daofuse experts, are there many other realm beings in the Upper Realm?"

"Many."

Zhao Chuan nodded, "During the migration, some Eternals followed, passing down through generations. Even if few descendants were born, the long span of ten thousand years, with the Upper Realm never sealed, has led to the establishment of many great cities by various races in the Upper Realm!"

Beside him, the Great Zhou King interjected, "The Upper Realm is vast. The Allheaven Battlefield is merely a testing ground. In ancient times, after its opening, humanity's goal was to develop the Upper Realm, even considering migrating humanity there! The Upper Realm has denser source qi and stronger power of laws."

At this point, the Great Zhou King hesitated before saying, "Back then, humanity discovered the Death Realm. Later, a human expert suggested that since humanity had unified the myriad realms, it should also develop a great realm, distinct from the myriad races! Ideally, it would be like the Death Realm, separated from the myriad realms, forming a three-layered world! Humanity would reside in the outer heavens, the myriad realms in the middle, and the Death Realm below!"

"Actually, efforts were underway. The Luminous Domain Mansion was initially intended as a palace. Humanity's main goal was the Upper Realm!"

Su Yu was puzzled, "Was the Upper Realm originally there, or was it developed later?"

"It was originally there, but more like an endless void!"

The Great Zhou King explained once more, "It's like the legendary creation of the heavens and earth, but not fully completed! The Myriad Realms were successfully established, but the Upper Realm and the Death Realm were not perfected. Later, a supreme expert perfected the Death Realm, and the Human Race also wanted to perfect the Upper Realm. They invested a lot of manpower and resources, but before it was fully completed, the Ancient Upheaval erupted!"

Su Yu nodded in understanding. "I see. The Human Race... was it the Human Emperor? Did they want to create a path similar to the Death Path, separate from the River of Time?"

Pondering this, Su Yu stroked his chin. "That doesn't make sense. According to my thoughts, the Upper Realm should be more difficult to connect with the River of Time! If the Human Race wanted to create their own path, their own river, it should be like the Death Realm, a path of its own!"

He turned to Zhao Chuan. "Is it difficult to access the River of Time in the Upper Realm?"

"Not at all," Zhao Chuan replied. "In fact, it feels even easier than in the Lower Realm, which makes cultivation and advancement simpler in the Upper Realm."

"This doesn't add up!" Su Yu frowned, finding it inconsistent with his expectations.

According to his theory, if the Upper Realm was intended by the Human Race to be like the Death Realm, a unique path, it would certainly block the interference of the River of Time, unless... Su Yu's eyes flickered.

Unless the Human Race intended to siphon the power of the River of Time!

To divert it!

If accessing the River of Time is easier, could it be that the experts of the Human Realm secretly opened a large breach in the River of Time to divert it into the Upper Realm? Or perhaps they even secretly relocated a segment of the River of Time to the Upper Realm?

Various thoughts surfaced in Su Yu's mind. He speculated that, based on some accounts, the foundation of the Upper Realm was actually not as deep as the Lower Realm. Tiangu and others refused to leave, not merely because they were reluctant to give up their power in the Lower Realm.

Even if Tiangu went to the Upper Realm, he wouldn't be a mere soldier. They, including the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, chose not to leave because the foundation in the Lower Realm was deeper, and there was more hope of becoming a master of the rules.

"Perhaps these people know something," Su Yu mused, forming a rough idea.

Moreover, he learned that the Human Race once wanted to emulate the Death Realm. Whether it was the Human Emperor or not, they might have wanted to create a separate path to escape the influence of the River of Time.

But evidently, they failed!

The Upper Realm failed to establish a successful path, and later, it was occupied by the myriad races.

"If I open the Heaven Gate and visit the Upper Realm, maybe I can discover something."

"Moreover, it's said that after the Upper Realm was sealed, those from the Upper Realm in the Lower Realm would be repelled, forced to return or find a place to hide. So many people being repelled should be due to the power of the River of Time rejecting them!"

Thoughts swirled in his mind.

Su Yu weighed everything in his heart and soon smiled, "Then I must trouble you all to map out the geography of the Upper Realm, including the major cities of each race, the distribution of powerful individuals, and the dangerous and strategic locations. Also, list the names of all Daofuse experts!"

"My lord, we don't know much..." Zhao Chuan began.

Su Yu interrupted with a smile, "It's fine, just a general understanding will do! Later, I'll kill the Symbol King and extract his memories. That should reveal quite a bit. Also, after the deaths of Marquis Falling Star and Marquis Abyss, I can extract some memories from them. With that, I can probably sketch out a complete picture of the Upper Realm!"

"The Great Zhou King might have visited the Upper Realm before. He might not know the current situation, but he should know about the ancient times."

"Moreover, the dead can speak. By finding some undead, we can learn more about the situation."

Su Yu tapped his chair lightly and smiled, "What is your purpose for descending to the Lower Realm this time?"

Zhao Chuan quickly replied, "Actually... it's already accomplished! Marquis Dingjun sent us down to have the Human Race in the Lower Realm help contain the myriad races, create some pressure, or, as before, kill some Eternals to shake the powerful individuals of the Upper Realm and alleviate some pressure."

"After Marquis Minshan was killed, the myriad races began besieging Marquis Zhennan of Tiankuling, and we were also targeted by the myriad races!"

Zhao Chuan said helplessly, "Because of this, and the fact that the Lower Realm seemed to have launched a major battle before, it's said that the Soldier King, Symbol King, Marquis Abyss, and Marquis Tianlong all descended, which did relieve a lot of pressure and burden for the Human Race in the Upper Realm."

The purpose was simple, and it was actually accomplished now. The Upper Realm must know that so many people have died.

But Su Yu found it amusing, "Is that enough? If I were the myriad races, unable to descend, I would find a way to kill all the Human Race in the Upper Realm first. Wouldn't that increase the pressure?"

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Or is it that your idea is simple, just wanting more powerful individuals from the myriad races to descend?"

Zhao Chuan awkwardly said, "There is some truth to that. Because of this tide, the Human Race was very weak before, yet it managed to attract many Daofuse experts from the myriad races to descend. Marquis Dingjun believes that there might be some changes in the Lower Realm, perhaps with the strength to help us."

He continued, "Also, Marquis Dingjun instructed us, if possible, to visit the Death Realm and find the Human Race experts there to buy us some time! So, earlier, when we went to Heavendoom City, we wanted to explore whether we could enter the Death Realm..."

Su Yu laughed, "Who are you looking for? Just anyone?"

"Not exactly. On the Human Race side, in the East King's Domain, it seems Marquis Lanshan is still there..." Zhao Chuan explained, "The East King's Domain is the territory of a Heavenly King expert, one of the four Heavenly Kings of the undead that the Human Race once conferred! Our race still has experts there, and Marquis Dingjun has some connections with them. If you are willing to let us enter the Death Realm, I can introduce you to Marquis Lanshan!"

Zhao Chuan seemed to regain some confidence. Yes, in the Living Realm, he had no way out.

But in the Death Realm, Marquis Dingjun had old connections!

Marquis Lanshan!

He secretly breathed a sigh of relief, having been worried that this person would disregard everything and kill them. But now, Zhao Chuan quickly said, "My lord, we can introduce Marquis Lanshan to Lord Hongmeng to ease some of the guarding pressure... In this way, the pressure on the Human Race will be much less!"

Su Yu smiled faintly, "Is that so? As far as I know, Marquis Lanshan doesn't have much say in the East King's Domain."

Zhao Chuan's heart trembled slightly, but he quickly said, "As long as it doesn't involve the East King's interests, it shouldn't be a big problem..."

Su Yu yawned and smiled. Suddenly, a large seal shot out!

It flew straight into the sky!

Su Yu had never opened a passage to the Death Realm in the Human Realm because... it was very dangerous. He hadn't located the Human Realm's territory in the Four Kings' Domains, and beneath the Human Realm might be the Land of the Abyss.

So, even if he went to the Death Realm, he wouldn't go through the Human Realm.

At this moment, the large seal soared into the sky, quickly flying out of the Human Realm.

Moments later, the seal plunged into Grand Dream City.

The seal passed unimpeded, with no one stopping it.

It flew all the way to the East King's Domain.

Marquis Lanshan quickly exited the main hall, exchanged a few words with the seal, and soon, the seal transformed into a suit of armor, enveloping Marquis Lanshan.

The death aura around Marquis Lanshan was concealed!

Soon, following the seal, she flew directly out of the undead passage. Old Turtle glanced at it, opened his mouth, but remained silent for a long time.

The Human Race's fortune was soaring, and this Human Lord Seal had grown even stronger.

It even brought out an undead, shielding it from the punishment of the rules. What was Su Yu planning to do by bringing Marquis Lanshan out of the realm?

...

Old Turtle didn't concern himself with these matters. No one could use Su Yu's Human Lord Seal unless Su Yu allowed them to.

The large seal traversed the heavens and quickly descended into the Human Realm.

In the Imperial Hall of Emperor Yu.

Others didn't know what Su Yu was doing, but at this moment, the Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng both sensed something and looked outside.

The next moment, a large seal pierced through the River of Time.

Within the seal, there seemed to be another person.

Soon, the seal transformed into battle armor, enveloping that person. Marquis Lanshan was also shocked, but amidst her shock, she was somewhat excited. It seemed... this was the Human Realm!

She quickly entered the hall, clad in the seal's battle armor, kneeling on one knee, her voice filled with excitement as she loudly proclaimed, "Lanshan pays respects to Your Majesty! Has Your Majesty summoned me to the Human Realm to deliver military orders?"

Su Yu chuckled, "No need to be nervous, there's no great battle. The great battle... has been won! You are also a top general of my Imperial House. I summoned you today to introduce you to some colleagues!"

Su Yu chuckled and said, "Just now, someone mentioned that their master knows you. Do you know Marquis Dingjun?"

"Marquis Dingjun?" Marquis Lanshan thought for a moment and said, "I think I know him. I was conferred the title posthumously, but later I learned about some of the conferments. Marquis Dingjun... should be a battalion general under King Ping. I'm not very familiar with him; his status isn't very high, and his strength is average. I served under the Martial King, and the generals under King Ping aren't very good at fighting! Does my lord want to capture this person?"

"..." 

At this moment, Zhao Chuan and the others were dumbfounded, their mouths agape.

This... was Marquis Lanshan?

In their stupor!

Su Yu smiled, "Why capture him? I just heard you might know each other, so I wanted to ask. So, you're not very familiar?"

"Yes!" Marquis Lanshan said, glancing at Wan Tiansheng and the Great Zhou King. She initially didn't pay much attention, but after a moment, she looked at the Great Zhou King again.

The Great Zhou King remained expressionless, seemingly indifferent.

Marquis Lanshan scrutinized him, suddenly curious, "Do I know you?"

The Great Zhou King smiled, "How could that be? Marquis Lanshan must be mistaken."

Marquis Lanshan frowned, hesitating for a while before saying, "I wouldn't mistake you! You... you seem... let me think, when did I see you... In the past, I served under the Martial King. Once, the Martial King sent me to ask the Human Emperor for some military supplies. I didn't see the Human Emperor, but was blocked by a scribe under him. That scribe was extremely annoying, with a smile just like yours, saying the Human Emperor wasn't responsible for distributing supplies and told me to find the Culture King..."

Marquis Lanshan pondered for a moment before hesitantly asking, "Is it you? I remember wanting to beat you up back then, but someone stopped me. Was it you?"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "How could it be!"

"Yes, that's the same laugh!" Marquis Lanshan frowned. "It matches your laugh, though your appearance... isn't quite the same. But we don't care about appearances; it's that expression, lying through your teeth! You clearly had supplies but refused to give them to me. It made me want to kill you!"

"…"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "You've really got the wrong person!"

"Impossible!" Marquis Lanshan was furious. "It must be you! If not you, then someone from your family! I might forget minor things, but I remember who I dislike! That smile of yours, I remember it!"

"I'm telling you, you've got the wrong person!"

"Yes, just like that, but back then you said, 'There really isn't any left!'"

Marquis Lanshan was enraged. "You said the supplies were gone! That the Culture King took them all and told me to find him. It was you, you bastard! I won't forget!"

The Great Zhou King's face stiffened. "You... I... it really wasn't..."

"Yes, you always argue like this!"

Marquis Lanshan was livid!

Meanwhile, Su Yu watched quietly, stroking his chin with a slight smile.

The Great Zhou King, looking helpless, turned to Su Yu with a hint of grievance, "Emperor Yu, I..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Marquis Lanshan might have mistaken you for someone else. Lanshan, you've got the wrong person. This is the Great Zhou King, not some clerk."

"He's the Great Zhou King?" Marquis Lanshan was taken aback, then reluctantly said, "Then... then I must have been mistaken!"

Su Yu smiled, "How are things below?"

"Everything is well! The disturbances in the Four Kings' Domains have been quelled, and the Celestial River of Death is currently calm. However, there seems to be some fighting in the Land of the Abyss. The South King has already gone to investigate but will not delve deep into the Land of the Abyss as per Your Majesty's orders."

"In the Spirit Suppression Domain, General Hongmeng is present, and all is stable."

"Hetu, the Chief of Staff, is searching for someone on Your Majesty's behalf..."

Marquis Lanshan quickly reported, then excitedly asked, "Your Majesty, may I visit the old lands of Lanshan later?"

Su Yu smiled, "Of course, but... it might not be there anymore! Lanshan, I don't recall hearing of such a place. Great Zhou King, do you know where the old lands of Lanshan are?"

The Great Zhou King forced a laugh, "Well..."

"Do you know?"

Su Yu said calmly, "If you don't, then you're quite negligent!"

The Great Zhou King, helpless, replied, "I know. The old lands of Lanshan are within the Great Zhou Prefecture! The name has changed; it's now called Gengshan..."

"Change it back!"

Su Yu said lightly, "Order the Great Zhou Prefecture to restore the ancient name Lanshan and grant the old lands of Lanshan to Marquis Lanshan!"

"By your command!"

Marquis Lanshan was overjoyed and quickly said, "Thank you, Your Majesty!"

"It was your land to begin with!"

Su Yu smiled, "Go and have a look. Chief Wan, accompany Marquis Lanshan, and then head to the Death Realm together. Although I've pacified the Four Kings' Domains, the Celestial River and the Land of the Abyss are not yet under control! If you're interested, Chief Wan, you can join Hetu in searching for Senior Ye Batian!"

"Thank you, Emperor Yu!"

Wan Tiansheng was somewhat surprised. Truly impressive.

This guy really managed to pacify the Death Realm!

Previously, he thought Su Yu was just boasting!

Now, hearing this, it's incredible. The Four Kings' Domains are under control, and he's even extending his reach to the Land of the Abyss and the Celestial River.

Even though Wan Tiansheng didn't know much about the Death Realm, seeing Zhao Chuan and the others with wide eyes and open mouths, he knew it wasn't simple.

He didn't say much more, quickly standing up and smiling, "Marquis Lanshan, I am Wan Tiansheng..."

Marquis Lanshan smiled, "I know you! Then I'll trouble Chief Wan to accompany me!"

"Of course!"

The two bowed to Su Yu and quickly left together.

Marquis Lanshan was eager!

Once they left, Su Yu looked at the few remaining people in the hall. At this moment, it was extremely quiet, with Zhao Chuan and the others in a daze.

Su Yu chuckled, "Marquis Lanshan and Marquis Dingjun might not be very familiar. If Marquis Dingjun has any instructions, you can tell me, and I'll inform Marquis Lanshan."

Zhao Chuan could no longer sit still. Trembling, he stood up, knelt on one knee, swallowed, and nervously said, "Subordinate... subordinate Zhao Chuan, under Marquis Dingjun, pays respects to Emperor Yu!"

The other three hesitated for a moment before also kneeling on one knee.

Su Yu smiled, "You're too polite. You are guests from the Upper Realm, generals under the ancient marquises, considered my seniors. I'm too young to deserve such courtesy!"

"We dare not!"

Zhao Chuan and the others were already in turmoil!

The Death Realm... was conquered by this person!

Not only is he the ruler of the living realm, but unbeknownst to the myriad realms, he has also conquered the Death Realm. Such an achievement has never been seen since ancient times!

Terrifying!

Expanding territories!

Aside from the ancient Human Emperor, this person... might have the greatest achievements!

Previously, he thought this person was just lucky, with many strong subordinates. Of course, there was fear, but not to this extent. Now, it's trembling!

He still thought he was useful, as Marquis Dingjun said he could contact the necromancer humans.

But then, Su Yu directly summoned Marquis Lanshan!

Looking at Marquis Lanshan's attitude, not even on equal footing, it was clear she had already pledged allegiance to Su Yu. Not only her, but even one of the legendary Four Heavenly Kings, the South King, had also pledged allegiance to Su Yu, as they had just heard!

Shocking news!

And Su Yu, still smiling, said, "You people are too formal! We humans of this tide don't care much about these things! Over in the Death Realm, Marquis Zhengyang and the others are also overly formal. But the humans of the ancient times didn't care much. That old Martial Emperor, he never shows a good face when he sees me, doesn't listen much. I'll find a chance to kill him..."

Silence.

Ancient times, Martial Emperor!

Each name uttered by Su Yu sent chills down their spines, making them tremble even more.

Su Yu smiled, "Great Zhou King, take them down and get the map ready for me! Also, treat these guests well, let them find the passages, and assess the danger secretly!"

After speaking, Su Yu called out, "Mountain Rise, Battle Dome!"

Moments later, two guardians appeared instantly.

Su Yu smiled, "You two are also figures from ancient times. Next, accompany the Great Zhou King and these esteemed guests to look around, chat, and find some ancient passages! If you feel it's dangerous, call on Heavendoom and the others. With over ten Daofuse experts escorting, it should be safe. Even if you encounter three to five Daofuse experts near the passage, you can kill them!"

Trembling!

Zhao Chuan and the others kept their heads down, saying nothing.

The Great Zhou King was also slightly stunned, quickly sensing the surroundings. At this moment, powerful auras appeared one after another.

He suddenly looked at Su Yu, his mouth opened, and after a long time, he said, "Emperor Yu, some of the guardians... have advanced to Daofuse?"

Su Yu nodded, "Yes, not many. Including General Hongmeng, only 11!"

He sighed, "Ah, just this few Daofuse. Even if we gather all the Daofuse in the Death Realm, it's only about 50. How can we fight the Upper Realm? It's really troubling!"

The Great Zhou King didn't know about this before. When Mountain Rise and the others entered the Human Realm, Old Turtle directly sent them through another passage. He knew someone came, but thought it was only the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King.

But... there were so many Daofuse?

The Great Zhou King really didn't know this!

At this moment, his expression was extremely complex. In this battle, Su Yu still had a dozen Daofuse hidden, at least 10 guardians didn't participate, Fat Ball didn't participate, and the Five Elemental Race Su Yu seemed to have subdued didn't appear, and there was also September...

One thought after another surfaced. Soon, the Great Zhou King smiled, "Alright, I'll take Zhao Chuan and the others to map and find the passages."

Su Yu smiled, "Then I'll leave it to you. Esteemed guests from the Upper Realm, I'm too busy to entertain you. If you have any requests, feel free to tell the Great Zhou King! If I ever visit the Upper Realm, I'll trouble you to guide me!"

At this time, Zhao Chuan and the others could barely stand. Zhao Chuan spoke with a slight tremor, quickly saying, "We dare not. If Your Majesty visits the Upper Realm, Marquis Dingjun will personally welcome you and will not neglect you!"

"That would be best."

Su Yu smiled, "Since you said so, I'll visit when I have the chance! The Upper Realm... is a good place for killing, with plenty of Daofuse, and many guardians haven't advanced to Daofuse yet. It's really troubling. Hopefully, killing three to fifty Daofuse will allow them to advance!"

Silence.

Mountain Rise and Battle Dome both grinned, going to the Upper Realm to kill Daofuse to advance?

It's... a good idea.

Quite good!

"Then I'll get busy. Make yourselves at home!"

Su Yu laughed and vanished into thin air.

Mountain Rise's ears twitched, smiling, "Great Zhou King, we'll protect you secretly. If you have any needs, just say so! Emperor Yu instructed us to fulfill all your requests!"

With that, a group of guardians also disappeared, but they didn't leave, instead hiding in the shadows.

The Great Zhou King glanced at the few people. Zhao Chuan and the others finally stood up. Zhao Chuan's clothes were soaked with sweat, his back drenched. He quickly evaporated the sweat and looked at the Great Zhou King.

At this moment, only the Great Zhou King could bring them some sense of security.

This new emperor of the Human Realm was increasingly terrifying to them!

The Great Zhou King softly said, "Do your job well, map the area, find the passages, and explore the Upper Realm! Don't fake it, don't bluff if you don't know. If Marquis Modang and the others die, extracting memories isn't impossible. If things don't match up... you know the consequences."

Zhao Chuan was extremely bitter, "Senior, we... we have no other intentions, really, we just..."

"Regardless of whether you know or not, just don't wander around or look where you shouldn't. Knowing too much isn't always a good thing. You've all met Marquis Lanshan, and you've seen those who guard us. The greatest secret of the Human Race is now open to you!"

Zhao Chuan, drenched in sweat, quickly responded, "I understand, Your Majesty. From now on, I will certainly serve Emperor Yu with all my might!"

The Great Zhou King chuckled, "At least your mind is still intact. The real fear is when the mind doesn't work properly. When you meet Marquis Dingjun in the future, I hope these fellows have their wits about them as well."

With that, he stopped discussing the matter.

It was truly frightening!

Not just for Zhao Chuan and the others, even he was taken aback.

Unbeknownst to them, Su Yu's strength had accumulated to a terrifying level.
