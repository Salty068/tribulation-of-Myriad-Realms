Chapter 689: The Amiable Su Yu (One Chapter Today)

In the Emperor Yu's Great Hall.

Su Yu laughed for a while, until he sobered up, then he reined in his smile and said, "Everyone, please sit and chat. Don't be too stiff. Guests from the Upper Realm are all seniors."

It felt quite polite!

But the more polite he was, the more fearful it made people.

The four looked at Great Zhou King and the others. Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng said nothing, taking their seats on either side.

The next moment, a cup of tea appeared before each of them, and they began to drink.

Their movements were remarkably synchronized!

They were both old hands; they'd just drink tea and listen. Wan Tiansheng liked to bring his large teacup to meetings, and Great Zhou King was much the same.

These two were scholars and disliked red-faced, shouting arguments.

Seeing this, the four dared not object and simply sat down.

Su Yu smiled and said, "Briefly tell me about the situation in the Upper Realm, and some of your requests. Does the Upper Realm have any instructions? The circumstances of the various races, and some basic information, tell me everything."

Then, he added, "What are your names, esteemed guests?"

The four quickly replied, "Zhao Chuan!"

"Pingyao."

"Zhou Nan."

"Zhang Hong."

Among the four, Zhao Chuan appeared to be the oldest. The woman called herself Pingyao. Su Yu didn't pay much attention to the other two.

All four had decent strength. In the past, if these four had descended to the Lower Realm, they would have been overlords.

They were all Eternal!

Zhao Chuan possessed the strength of a seventh-stage Eternal, while the other three were all mid-stage, with no low-stage cultivators present—they had probably all died.

Still a respectable force!

Su Yu had previously thought there weren't many people left in the Upper Realm, with so many Daofuse cultivators, most of them must be Daofuse. But now it seemed that wasn't the case; there were quite a few Eternal cultivators too.

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Zhao Chuan, the oldest, secretly breathed a sigh of relief when Su Yu nodded. He quickly said, "Reporting to Your Excellency, we all come from under Dingjun Hou of the Human Race! Over these past few millennia, the Human Race's experts in the Upper Realm have been struggling to survive. To preserve the embers and allow the Human Race to rise again, countless experts have fallen! As of now, the Human Realm has six factions in the Upper Realm!"

"Zhennan Hou, hidden in Tianku Ridge!"

"Yunshui Hou, hidden in Fuchen River."

"Huoyun Hou, hidden in Shenhuo Mountain."

"And Yingwu General, temporarily residing in Yixian Gorge, and our own Dingjun Hou."

That was only five factions.

Su Yu looked at him. Zhao Chuan quickly added, "There's also another faction, actually a lone wolf, Shadow Hou! He has no fixed abode and primarily relies on sneak attacks. Previously, there was actually the strongest faction, Minshan Hou, but something happened to Minshan Hou... and the Human Race forces he commanded have been annihilated."

Five Hou and one General, who had probably also advanced to Daofuse.

This was the current situation in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu wasn't in a hurry to ask about other things. Instead, he smiled and said, "Among these six factions, how many are women?"

"..."

Zhao Chuan felt suspicious but dared not ask further. He quickly replied, "Yunshui Hou and Yingwu General are both women. I'm not sure about Shadow Hou, as I haven't met him/her."

Su Yu nodded slightly. "So, that means there are only six Daofuse cultivators?"

"We only know this much for now."

Zhao Chuan continued, "Because everyone is hiding, some may have completely gone into seclusion, waiting for the Upper Realm to open. Even Dingjun Hou doesn't know if anyone else is alive. What we know are the forces that are currently active, including those engaged in counterattacks."

Beside him, Great Zhou King sighed.

Only six left!

In the last tide, there were seventy or eighty Human Race Daofuse cultivators, and now only six remained. Truly, less than one in ten survived!

Great Zhou King saw Su Yu looking at him and sighed softly, "I'm a little emotional, Emperor Yu. May I ask a few questions?"

"Great Zhou King, please do."

Great Zhou King looked at Zhao Chuan: "These are all survivors from the last tide. So, in these past few millennia, have you not produced any new Daofuse cultivators? The Lower Realm needs to be sealed, but the Upper Realm does not, nor does it require slumber. The legacy hasn't been broken, so have no new Daofuse cultivators emerged?"

Zhao Chuan also sighed, "We haven't heard of any for now. Because the myriad races are pursuing us too closely, we've actually been constantly hiding and fighting. Some talented experts are also prime targets for the myriad races! Coupled with insufficient resources, and in the Upper Realm, the power of laws is very evident. If someone advances to Daofuse, the many experts of the myriad races will quickly notice and come to hunt them down..."

There were only six Daofuse factions, and they were all hiding.

Six Daofuse cultivators—if it were before, Su Yu would have exclaimed, "There are still so many Daofuse cultivators in the Upper Realm?"

Now... he had killed six today!

Too few!

Su Yu smiled and said, "Then how many Daofuse cultivators do the myriad races have?"

"This..."

Zhao Chuan thought for a moment and said, "We truly don't know the exact number. Our intelligence gathering is very difficult, but there are probably seventy or eighty! The Human Race hasn't produced new Daofuse cultivators, but the myriad races have produced quite a few, because they are powerful and occupy the Upper Realm's resources, so new Daofuse cultivators are born."

"Seventy or eighty Daofuse cultivators, and they couldn't wipe you out?"

Su Yu asked, puzzled. Were the myriad races that useless?

It had been so many years, and he heard they hadn't gone into slumber either.

Zhao Chuan explained, "The Upper Realm is actually very vast, and there are many dangerous places! As long as the Human Race doesn't stay in one place for too long and constantly delves into various dangerous areas, it's actually very difficult for the myriad races to pursue them! Often, for every Human Race member killed, the myriad races lose two or even three of their own!"

"After the Ninth Tide ended, for the first thousand years, the pursuit was relentless. At that time, there were more than a dozen Human Race Daofuse cultivators who fled to the Upper Realm. Minshan Hou and several other lords were very powerful and also counterattacked... The battles were constant back then. Later, several top Human Race experts died in battle, and Minshan Hou ordered all sides to disperse and hide, breaking into smaller groups, making it harder for the myriad races to encircle and suppress them!"

Zhao Chuan quickly added, "Since then, the myriad races' efforts to encircle and suppress us have diminished significantly. Moreover, the myriad races are not a monolithic entity. There are treasures in the Upper Realm, many treasures, especially some laws of the Great Dao..."

Fearing Su Yu wouldn't understand, he explained, "There are some ownerless laws of the Great Dao in the Upper Realm! Some are broken, some are complete. It is said that if one obtains an ownerless law of the Great Dao, there is hope of becoming a Guize Zhuzhu! Therefore, while pursuing the Human Race, the myriad races are also vying for these treasures."

"As the Human Race's experts grew fewer and fewer, the myriad races freed up their hands, and in the later stages, most of their energy was focused on their internal struggles!"

Only a few Human Race Daofuse cultivators remained, and they were all hiding tightly.

The myriad races' plan was also simple: instead of searching little by little, it was better to wait for the Lower Realm to open. Could these old Human Race relics watch their race be annihilated and do nothing?

Tiangu and the others didn't destroy the Human Race before, partly due to this thought.

Don't wipe out the Human Race completely, or those old relics in the Upper Realm won't come down, and will just focus on hiding and opposing them.

So, those people in the Upper Realm did play a certain role, preventing the early annihilation of the Human Race. The Human Race was a bait.

"Are there any Guize Zhuzhu in the Upper Realm?"

"None!"

Zhao Chuan shook his head, "It is said that a few old relics might be close to that stage, but there are no Guize Zhuzhu. If there were, they would have appeared long ago! Most of these experts are now in seclusion and rarely appear! They are all focused on reaching that stage!"

He added, "According to some sayings in the Upper Realm, in this era, Guize Zhuzhu are difficult to be born, mainly because some necessary things are missing..."

Seeing Su Yu look at him, he shook his head, "I don't know what exactly. However, in the ancient era, so many Guize Zhuzhu were born. It makes no sense that after so many years, not a single one has been born! Guize Zhuzhu are incredibly powerful, but in the ancient period, more than a hundred appeared in a short time. Many of those who survived are Hou from the ancient period. To be conferred Hou, they were also powerful in ancient times. Why, after a hundred thousand years, are they still unable to reach that stage?"

Su Yu pondered, the old relics in the Upper Realm might have indeed discovered something.

Indeed, after 100,000 years, those Daofuse cultivators from back then couldn't all have fused with others' Daos, right?

If they fused Daos, it's unlikely the original owners would still be alive, right?

So why, after so many years, has not a single one been born?

Did Human Emperor and the others do something?

Su Yu could only think along these lines. Zhao Chuan then added, "It is said that it might have something to do with the River of Time. In fact, the inability to give birth to Guize Zhuzhu has been the case for many years. After the great sealing of the world in ancient times, it seems it became impossible!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. "So, there are no Guize Zhuzhu in the Upper Realm, but there should be some experts close to that stage."

"There are!"

Su Yu smiled. "I'm very curious about one thing. Besides Daofuse cultivators, are there many other realms of beings in the Upper Realm?"

"Many."

Zhao Chuan nodded, "When the migration happened, quite a few Eternal cultivators followed. Passed down through generations, even if not many descendants were born, the sheer length of time, a hundred thousand years, and the Upper Realm not being sealed, means that now, the various races in the Upper Realm have also built many giant cities!"

Beside him, Great Zhou King interjected, "The Upper Realm is vast. The Allheaven Battlefield is just a testing ground. In fact, after the ancient era's opening, the Human Race's goal at that time was to open up the Upper Realm, and they even considered migrating the Human Race to the Upper Realm! The source qi in the Upper Realm is richer, and the power of laws is stronger."

At this point, Great Zhou King hesitated before saying, "Back then, the Human Race discovered the Death Realm. Later, some Human Race experts said that since our Human Race had unified the Myriad Realms, the Human Race should also open up a Great Realm, separate from the myriad races! Ideally, like the Death Realm, it would be separated from the Myriad Worlds, together forming three layers of heaven and earth! The Human Race's Heaven Beyond Heaven, the Myriad Realms in the middle, and the Death Realm below!"

"In fact, it was already underway back then. The Luminous Domain Mansion was originally built to serve as a temporary palace, and the Human Race's main target was the Upper Realm!"

Su Yu asked with some doubt, "Was the Upper Realm originally existing, or was it opened up later?"

"It existed originally, but it was more like an endless void!"

Great Zhou King explained again, "It's like the legendary creation of heaven and earth, but not fully completed! The Myriad Worlds were successfully opened, but the Upper Realm and the Death Realm were incomplete. A supreme expert later perfected the Death Realm, and the Human Race also wanted to perfect the Upper Realm! In fact, a lot of manpower and resources were invested, but before it was completely finished, the Ancient Transformation broke out!"

Su Yu understood. "I see. The Human Race... was it Human Emperor? Did he want to open up a Great Dao similar to the Death Dao? To break free from the River of Time?"

Thinking of this, Su Yu stroked his chin, "That's not right. According to my thoughts, it should be harder for the Upper Realm to connect to the River of Time! If the Human Race wanted to open up its own Dao, its own river, then it should be like the Death Realm, with one Dao reigning supreme!"

He looked at Zhao Chuan, "Is it difficult to open the River of Time in your Upper Realm?"

"Not difficult."

Zhao Chuan explained, "Not only is it not difficult, it feels even simpler than in the Lower Realm. So, cultivation and advancement in the Upper Realm are actually easier."

"This isn't right!"

Su Yu frowned. That didn't match his expectations.

According to his thoughts, if the Upper Realm was prepared by the Human Race to be like the Death Realm, to open a separate Dao, then it would definitely shield itself from the interference of the River of Time, unless... Su Yu's eyes flickered.

Unless the Human Race wanted to steal the power of the River of Time!

To divert it!

It was easier to open the River of Time. Could it be that the Human Realm experts secretly opened a large gap in the River of Time, preparing to divert its flow into the Upper Realm?

Or, did they simply secretly intercept a section of the River of Time and move it to the Upper Realm?

All sorts of thoughts arose and surfaced. Su Yu speculated in his mind, because according to some sayings, the Upper Realm's foundation was actually inferior to the Lower Realm's. Tiangu and these people stubbornly refused to leave, not simply because they were reluctant to give up power in the Lower Realm.

Tiangu wouldn't be a small soldier if he went to the Upper Realm.

They didn't leave, including Supervisor Hou, seemingly all because the Lower Realm had a deeper foundation and offered more hope of becoming a Guize Zhuzhu.

"Perhaps these guys know something."

Su Yu thought to himself, generally having some ideas.

Moreover, he also knew some things. The Human Race back then also wanted to emulate the Death Realm. Perhaps it was Human Emperor, who might have also wanted to open up a separate Great Dao, free from the influence of the River of Time.

But it had clearly failed!

The Upper Realm failed to successfully open its Great Dao. Not only that, it was later occupied by the myriad races.

"If I open the Heaven Gate and go to the Upper Realm, perhaps I can discern something."

"And it is said that after the Upper Realm was sealed, those from the Upper Realm in the Lower Realm would be repelled, only able to return or find a place to hide. So many people being repelled should be the power of the River of Time repelling them!"

One thought after another arose.

Su Yu weighed everything in his mind and quickly smiled, "Then I trouble you all to draw out the terrain and features of the Upper Realm, including the giant cities of the major races, the distribution of experts, dangerous areas, and list all the names of the Daofuse experts!"

"Your Excellency, we don't know too much..."

Su Yu interrupted, smiling, "It's fine, a general understanding is enough! Later, I'll go kill Talisman King and extract his memories, which should also reveal a lot. Also, Meteor Hou and Abyss Hou were killed, I can extract some memories from them. Combining these, I should be able to outline a complete Upper Realm!"

"Great Zhou King, you might have been to the Upper Realm before. You might not know the current situation, but you should know what it was like in ancient times."

"Moreover, the dead can also speak. I can find some spirits to learn about the situation."

Su Yu gently tapped his chair and smiled, "Then what is the purpose of your descent this time?"

Zhao Chuan quickly said, "Actually... it's already completed! Dingjun Hou sent us down, actually just wanting the Human Race in the Lower Realm to help contain the myriad races, create some pressure, or, as before, kill some Eternal cultivators, shaking some experts of the myriad races in the Upper Realm, to alleviate some pressure on the Upper Realm."

"After Minshan Hou was killed, the myriad races began to encircle and suppress Zhennan Hou in Tianku Ridge again, and we were also targeted by the myriad races!"

Zhao Chuan said helplessly, "Precisely because of this, coupled with the great war that seemed to have broken out in the Lower Realm before, it is said that Weapon King, Talisman King, Abyss Hou, and Heavenly Dragon Hou all descended to the Lower Realm, which indeed relieved a lot of pressure and burden on the Human Race in the Upper Realm."

The purpose was actually simple, and in fact, it had already been achieved. The Upper Realm must know that so many people had died.

But Su Yu chuckled, "Is that acceptable? If I were one of the myriad races, unable to descend, I would naturally try to kill all the Human Race members in the Upper Realm first. Aren't you afraid of even greater pressure?"

Su Yu narrowed his eyes and smiled, "Or, is your idea actually very simple: you simply want more myriad race experts to descend to the Lower Realm?"

Zhao Chuan awkwardly said, "We did have that thought, because in this tide, the Human Race was very weak before, yet it could attract many myriad race Daofuse cultivators to descend. Dingjun Hou's meaning was that some changes might have occurred in the Lower Realm, and perhaps it has the strength to help us."

After speaking, he added, "Oh, and one more thing. Dingjun Hou instructed us that if we had the chance, we should try to go to the Death Realm and find the Human Race experts there, asking them to buy us some time! So, when we went to Heavendoom City before, we also wanted to investigate if we could go to the Death Realm..."

Su Yu smiled, "Find whom? Just randomly search?"

"Not exactly. On the Human Race side, in the East King's Residence, Arshan Hou seems to still be there..." Zhao Chuan explained, "The East King's Residence is the territory of a Heavenly King expert, one of the four Heavenly Kings of the Death Realm conferred by the Human Race back then! Our clan still has experts there. Dingjun Hou has some connections with them. If Your Excellency is willing to let us enter the Death Realm, I can introduce you to them!"

Zhao Chuan seemed to have finally found a bit of confidence. Yes, in the Living Realm, he was helpless.

But, in the Death Realm, Dingjun Hou had old connections!

Arshan Hou!

He secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He had been worried that this person would ignore them and kill them, but now, Zhao Chuan quickly said, "Your Excellency, we can introduce Arshan Hou to Grand Dream Lord, to relieve some of Grand Dream Lord's pressure in guarding... This way, the Human Race's pressure will be much less!"

Su Yu smiled ambiguously, "Is that so? As far as I know, Arshan Hou in the East King's Residence doesn't seem to have much say."

Zhao Chuan's heart trembled slightly, and he quickly said, "As long as it doesn't involve the East King's interests, it shouldn't be a big problem..."

Su Yu yawned and smiled. Suddenly, a large seal shot out!

It flew straight out of the sky!

Su Yu had never opened a Death Realm passage in the Human Realm, because... it was very dangerous. He hadn't located the Human Realm's territory in the Four King Domains. Below the Human Realm might be the Land of Return to Emptiness.

So, even if he went to the Death Realm, he wouldn't go through the Human Realm.

At this moment, that large seal soared into the sky, quickly flying out of the Human Realm.

A moment later, the large seal plunged into Grand Dream City.

The large seal passed unhindered, with no one blocking it.

It flew all the way to the East King's Residence.

Arshan Hou quickly emerged from the Great Hall and exchanged a few words with the large seal. Soon, the large seal transformed into a battle armor, enveloping Arshan Hou.

Arshan Hou's death qi was concealed!

Soon, she followed the large seal all the way, directly exiting the Death Realm passage. The old turtle glanced at it, opened his mouth, and was speechless for a long time.

The Human Race's luck surged, and this Human Lord Seal became even stronger.

It even brought a spirit out, and shielded it from the rules' punishment. What was Su Yu taking Arshan Hou out of the realm for?

...

The old turtle didn't concern himself with these matters. No one could use Su Yu's Human Lord Seal unless Su Yu allowed them to.

The large seal, piercing through heaven and earth, quickly descended into the Human Realm.

In the Emperor Yu's Great Hall.

The others didn't know what Su Yu was doing. At this moment, Great Zhou King and Wan Tiansheng both moved their eyes, looking outwards.

The next moment, a large seal pierced through the River of Time.

Within the large seal, there seemed to be a person.

Soon, the large seal transformed into battle armor, enveloping that person. Arshan Hou was also shocked, and amidst her shock, she was somewhat excited, it seemed... it was the Human Realm!

She quickly entered the Great Hall, clad in the large seal battle armor, knelt on one knee, extremely excited, and loudly declared, "Arshan greets Your Majesty! Your Majesty summoned me to the Human Realm, is there a military order to be issued?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Don't be nervous, there's no great war. The great war... we won! You are also a top general of my Emperor Yu's Mansion. I summoned you today to introduce you to some colleagues!"

Su Yu chuckled and said, "Coincidentally, someone said his master knows you. Do you know Dingjun Hou?"

"Dingjun Hou?"

Arshan Hou thought for a moment and said, "I think I know him. I was conferred Hou after death, but later I also learned about some conferment situations. Dingjun Hou... should be a camp general under Peace King. Not very familiar, his status wasn't too high, and his strength was average. I was under Martial King. Generals under Peace King are mostly not good at fighting! Does Your Excellency wish to capture this person?"

"..."

At this moment, Zhao Chuan and the others gaped, utterly stunned.

This... this was Arshan Hou?

In a daze!

Su Yu smiled, "Why capture him? I just heard you know each other, so I'm asking about the situation. So, not too familiar?"

"Yes!"

Arshan Hou said, looking at Wan Tiansheng and Great Zhou King. She glanced at them, initially not paying attention, but after a while, she suddenly looked at Great Zhou King again.

Great Zhou King, however, remained expressionless, as if he didn't care.

Arshan Hou looked closely, then suddenly asked strangely, "I know you?"

Great Zhou King smiled, "How could that be? Arshan Hou must be mistaken."

Arshan Hou frowned. After a long pause, she hesitated, "Impossible to be mistaken! You... you seem... Let me think, when did I see you... In the past, I served under Martial King. Once, Martial King asked me to go to Human Emperor to request some military supplies, but I didn't see Human Emperor. I was stopped by a scribe under Human Emperor. That scribe was utterly detestable, just like you, with that kind of smile, saying that Human Emperor wasn't responsible for distributing supplies and told me to go to Culture King..."

As Arshan Hou thought, she hesitated, "Was it you? I remember I wanted to beat you up,
