Chapter 811: Setting Out! (Please Subscribe)

Su Yu had plans for the myriad races. Of course, the other side might not necessarily follow his plans, so he had two strategies: first, eliminate them directly; second, drive a wedge between them.

If the myriad races were still led by figures like Moon Heavenly Venerable, Su Yu would opt for the first strategy. However, now it was Tiangu and the Divine Empress leading them. In this case, the second strategy was possible. It wasn't that Tiangu and the others were more foolish; rather, they were more aware of how troublesome Su Yu could be.

The older generation, deeply entrenched in their ways, thought that Su Yu was young, not yet a ruler of laws. They had seen countless rulers of laws and believed that Su Yu's rapid progress now didn't guarantee the same in the future. But Tiangu and the others had suffered too many losses at Su Yu's hands. They had witnessed Su Yu rise from the Skysoar Realm to his current level in the blink of an eye. Even when he was in the Skysoar Realm, attempts by Sunmoon and Eternal experts to kill him had failed. Su Yu seemed omnipotent. Deep down, they feared Su Yu more.

...

At this moment, Su Yu returned to his Human Lord Seal. As he looked at it, a thought suddenly struck him: he used the Human Lord Seal as the foundation for his world, while the Lord of the Dead used the River of Time as his foundation. But what about the River of Time itself? It must have a foundation, right? It couldn't just fix the Dao out of thin air, could it? Was it simply stabilized by chaos?

Su Yu pondered for a while but didn't dwell on it. Until now, he hadn't reached either end of the River of Time. It was said to be the convergence of all paths, but Su Yu vaguely understood that the main avenue of the River of Time might be the Dao of Eternity.

In the river, just like in Su Yu's world, the Lord of Time could truly control the flow of time. Of course, this was relative to the Myriad Realms. Su Yu could barely manage something similar. For instance, in his world, he could plant two trees simultaneously and accelerate the growth of one. This created a time flow comparison, where the flow of time was actually the same, but it resulted in a perceived difference in time flow.

This relativity was quite intriguing. Artificial acceleration would make the normally growing tree perceive the other as having a faster time flow. Conversely, the accelerated tree would perceive its own time flow as normal, making the normal tree seem slower. This might be the main avenue of the River of Time, akin to the responsibilities of the Human Emperor or the Death Path of the Lord of the Dead.

Su Yu's pursuit was similar to that of the Lord of Time. He didn't solely aim to reach the pinnacle of one Dao. He could have his specialties, but he wouldn't overly neglect other Daos.

At this moment, Su Yu stood before the entrance opened by the Human Lord Seal, looking up at the sky. For a moment, the world seemed to expand, and in the void, a power of the great Dao appeared. As it swept across, everyone felt as if they were separated from Su Yu by a different time and space. They felt as if only a moment had passed, yet it seemed like a long time had gone by for Su Yu.

"Time!" someone murmured in disbelief. What exactly was Su Yu comprehending? Could he gain insights just by walking?

The Great Zhou King, who had accompanied Su Yu, was also dumbfounded. What was happening? They had just been chatting about trivial matters, and now Su Yu was suddenly comprehending the Dao?

At this moment, the top experts within the Human Lord Seal were all shocked. Su Yu often had these sudden and bizarre moments of enlightenment. Even during casual conversations, he might think of something and then, just like that, he would comprehend it!

Comprehended!

There was no reasoning with this!

The Great Zhou King was also feeling complicated. He waited for Su Yu to open his eyes before smiling wryly, "Your Majesty... have you comprehended the Dao again?"

"Comprehended the Dao?" Su Yu looked at the sky, then at the others, and laughed, "Not really. This doesn't count as comprehending the Dao. It's just some insights into certain Daos, some feelings. Does that count as comprehending the Dao?"

Su Yu chuckled. It really didn't count! He had just had a sudden idea to try dividing time within his world. For instance, if three days passed for Wan Tiansheng and the others, only one day would pass for him. This would create a time flow difference. Of course, Su Yu's time was aligned with the Myriad Realms.

Making one day in the Myriad Realms equal ten days for Su Yu was difficult, but one or two days, even three, was something Su Yu could barely manage, though he couldn't maintain it for long. He still had to control the time of the Myriad Realms, which was quite challenging.

At this moment, everyone looked at Su Yu with complex expressions. This was what it meant to be a genius. Su Yu was a true genius, and he dared to think. His mind was so expansive, he dared to think about anything, and his ability to put thoughts into practice was unmatched.

"Congratulations, Your Majesty!" everyone congratulated him. Su Yu laughed, "I told you, it's nothing. Just ordinary insights, not worth congratulating! My understanding of the Dao is still shallow. I need all of you to progress with me!"

It wasn't false modesty. Su Yu had many specialties, but he wasn't proficient in any. His Daos were actually quite weak. The Lord of Time was the master of myriad Daos, and so was Su Yu. The Lord of Time's Dao was a great river, while Su Yu's was a mere stream. Both could be considered rulers of laws, but the difference was vast. If the Lord of Time were truly present, he could blow Su Yu away with a single breath.

Of course, Su Yu progressed quickly, not because he had greater talent, but because the other had reached an extreme, while Su Yu was just starting. At the beginning stage, progress was naturally easier than at the peak.

Now, he still relied on everyone to progress with him and help him perfect his Daos. As everyone advanced, he could advance too. This was what all creators of worlds did. The Culture King seemed not to have done this... it's unclear what kind of world the Culture King created. As for the Human Emperor, he hadn't even started before it ended, so he didn't have the chance to do this.

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "It's what we wish for, and we dare not ask for more!"

Indeed, this was everyone's wish!

But Su Yu laughed, "You can forget about it. Don't tell me these things. If you have time, help me perfect the seven emotions and six desires in my world!"

Old Wan hadn't merged with the Dao! What was he talking about! But he could help perfect the Dao. In terms of humanity, Su Yu's world was indeed lacking. He had killed many strong races, but he had rarely killed humans. As for the Control King's lineage, even though Su Yu killed them, there weren't many who could be integrated into the Dao!

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "That's inevitable. When Your Majesty's Dao can withstand a stronger power explosion, and a true ruler of laws is born, then we can all merge the Dao of the River of Time into Your Majesty's Dao, and there will surely be a qualitative improvement!"

Ruler of laws...

Su Yu thought of this and looked at the South Heavenly King, curiously asking, "South Heavenly King, how do you feel about your strength now?"

The South Heavenly King had been improving recently, right? Su Yu hadn't paid much attention. He rarely actively probed the strength of those who had merged into his Dao. It left people with no secrets, and Su Yu hated that feeling. Any cultivator would hate it.

The South Heavenly King remained aloof. Before and after her resurrection, she spoke little in Su Yu's presence. Occasionally, she would show a motherly affection towards Su Yu, which left him speechless, but he couldn't say anything. After all, the first time he met the South Heavenly King, he had pretended to be innocent, calling her "Master's wife" and coaxing her into working for him. First impressions were important!

At this moment, hearing Su Yu's question, the South Heavenly King looked at him with a hint of motherly affection... In her eyes, Su Yu was still the child who had appeared strong on the surface but was soft inside when she first saw him. All his strength, dominance, and arrogance were just a facade. Su Yu was still young, a real child, still a baby.

To maintain Su Yu's dignity, she didn't show it too obviously, but some people could clearly sense it, and they couldn't help but laugh. Su Yu rarely suffered losses, but the South Heavenly King's motherly gaze... Su Yu couldn't resist it.

At this moment, the South Heavenly King looked at Su Yu, showing a faint, somewhat stiff smile, "Not bad. With Your Majesty's world expanding, we also rise with the tide. However, after the expansion, mastering the Dao becomes more difficult!"

The South Heavenly King continued, "So, now is actually the best time to master the Dao... I feel I'm close!"

Su Yu nodded, "I feel it too, but I think you haven't truly mastered the Whip Dao yet! By the way, South Heavenly King, do you have a weapon?"

The Dao the South Heavenly King had merged into was quite special—it was the Whip Dao. But it seemed she never used a whip.

"Not necessary."

The South Heavenly King said calmly, "Weapons are external. The Dao can be the whip!"

She had almost succeeded in her last resurrection, but now she was still a bit short. Su Yu said, "South Heavenly King, you haven't mastered the Whip Dao for so long. Is there a problem? If there is, you can tell me."

The South Heavenly King remained silent. Su Yu was puzzled. Was there really a problem? The South Heavenly King continued to be silent for a while, feeling a bit stifled, and said in a low voice, "Your Majesty, we have only been resurrected for less than a month!"

Was it a long time?

Su Yu's words made everyone think hundreds of years had passed. What did he mean by "so long," and the South Heavenly King still hadn't mastered the Dao? My goodness, it's only been a few days! What did you think?

Su Yu was taken aback and nodded, "Oh, right! I felt like a long time had passed. So... it hasn't even been a month yet!"

Everyone was exhausted. No, it hadn't. After everyone was resurrected, it hadn't been long before Su Yu went to the Upper Realm. After going to the Upper Realm, he quickly started targeting the Control King's lineage. After defeating them, Su Yu quickly prepared for the sealing-breaking matter. Until now, returning here, it had only been a short time.

Was it a long time?

Everyone was speechless.

Su Yu felt a bit awkward. Why did it seem like so much time had passed? Seeing the helpless expressions of those around him, he could only say, "I don't have much of a concept of time right now. It's just that since everyone was resurrected, I've made significant progress in my strength, so I assumed it was the same for everyone else!"

Goodness!

The crowd was shocked. What did he mean by significant progress?

After Su Yu opened the heavens, he was already capable of battling someone at the level of the Chaos Dragon. It was only after that when the South Heavenly King and others were resurrected. In other words, Su Yu felt that compared to before, his strength had increased so much that he had lost track of time.

Just how strong was Su Yu now?

At this moment, the clever ones didn't ask, but the more straightforward ones couldn't hold back. Heavendoom eagerly asked, "Your Majesty, just how strong are you now? Can you take on the Hundred Battle King?"

Su Yu laughed, "Peeking into someone's strength is a sin, you know?"

"Your Majesty, you can't say that. You need to motivate everyone a bit!"

Heavendoom chuckled, "You're our leader, Your Majesty. If you can't even defeat Hongmeng, wouldn't that be embarrassing?"

"......"

Su Yu chuckled, seeing that many were indeed interested or perhaps expectant. After pondering for a moment, he said, "Well... it depends on the situation! In my own world, I feel that in the current Myriad Realms, there's no one I wouldn't dare to fight. Whether I can win is another matter, but I dare to fight them all!"

Everyone was taken aback!

Su Yu continued, "But outside, my strength isn't that formidable."

Su Yu assessed, "I haven't truly fought with other rulers of laws, but if I were to gauge, outside, I might be able to battle the Divine Empress, but I probably wouldn't be a match for the Hundred Battle King or the Martial Emperor!"

The crowd was once again shocked!

That was already the level of a ruler of laws, no wonder Su Yu said his strength had improved so rapidly that he lost track of time.

Su Yu smiled, "The Divine Empress probably hasn't fully recovered to her peak. If I were to estimate... I'm probably like an average ruler of laws who has just mastered the Dao. That should be a fair assessment!"

Su Yu shook his head, "At the level of a ruler of laws, the classifications become quite chaotic. There aren't many people to classify, so everyone just proves themselves through combat. It's hard to quantify!"

Before reaching this point, one could look at how many Daos everyone had merged. After that, in terms of realms, they were actually quite similar.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King smiled, "Your Majesty, when it comes to rulers of laws, there were actually some classifications back in the day, mainly used internally by the Human Race to mark the strength of opponents and how to deal with them."

Su Yu became interested, "It wasn't passed down?"

"There are few rulers of laws, and after they all left, this classification became useless!"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment and said, "According to the classifications by the Human Emperor and the Three Extremes Human Kings back then, they divided our opponents into five levels!"

"Just like Your Majesty's classification of Daofuse, the highest level, the first-class rulers of laws, were classified according to the standards of the Human Emperor and the Culture King. The second class was based on the strength of the other three kings! The third class was the level of the Battle King, the fourth class was the level of the Snow King, and the fifth class was some ancient physical kings..."

Su Yu became interested, "Then what level was the Martial Emperor in that era?"

"About the level of the third-class Battle King!"

The Great Xia King couldn't help but interject, "Can you not categorize my ancestor in your classification system?"

"......"

The Great Zhou King was speechless. Well, I need a reference point.

He couldn't be bothered to respond and continued, "This was according to the later classification. The Martial Emperor was relatively early. Before that, he was actually on the same level as the Martial King, but later on, everyone made progress! According to the later classification, the Martial Emperor was on the same level as the Battle King. He has been sealed for many years and may not even match the Battle King now..."

Indeed, time is the most terrifying thing.

The limits of the past, the first-class Human Emperor and Culture King, later opened the heavens and raised the upper limit again.

The standards of combat power have always been changing.

"So, according to the end of ancient times, the Martial Emperor was on the same level as the Battle King, right?"

"Yes!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "The Chaos Dragon and Moon Battle should be slightly weaker than the ancient physical Dao Human Kings, but not by much. If you really want to look at it, you can barely consider them fifth-class rulers of laws. Then, Your Majesty... can match a true ruler of laws. Does that mean Your Majesty possesses the combat power of the fourth-class Snow King?"

Xuelan remained silent.

The Great Zhou King was annoying!

He had to add a representative after each class, couldn't he use someone else?

The classification at the end of ancient times.

Su Yu thought for a moment and said, "If that's the case, the Martial Emperor is only third-class now. As for the Hundred Battle King... I estimate he's weak third-class, strong fourth-class! Yu Qing is also a typical fourth-class, and the Divine Empress has just recovered, probably only a strong fifth-class, not quite fourth-class."

The Great Zhou King spoke, "So Your Majesty means that currently, among the rulers of laws in the Myriad Realms, the Martial Emperor is truly the strongest?"

Su Yu nodded, "For now, among those who have appeared, the Martial Emperor should be the strongest! Next would be the Hundred Battle King, possibly close to the Boro Dragon Beast! Then Yu Qing, the Divine Empress, and finally the Chaos Dragon, Moon Battle, and Fat Ball!"

Fat Ball, on the Hundred Battle King's side, said that Moon Luo and Wu Ji could fight, but Su Yu didn't take it seriously, scoffing. Fat Ball hadn't really gone all out.

Fat Ball might have been similar to them before, but after becoming stronger, the white Fat Ball was definitely stronger than Moon Luo and the others.

In Su Yu's view, Moon Luo and Wu Ji were at the level of the Saint Marquis and Sun Corona.

Thinking of this, Su Yu added, "The Myriad Races' classification of realms and strength is too broad. After all, there are too many strong individuals, and with the seal of the heavens and earth, some special state Heavenly Venerables have appeared... Actually, some people can't be considered Heavenly Venerables anymore! The Chaos Dragon and Moon Battle can't be considered as such!"

Su Yu smiled, "Understanding the strength of opponents is still necessary. Know yourself and your enemy, and you can win a hundred battles!"

"Rulers of laws are separate, and even the fifth-class should be excluded!"

"The true top Heavenly Venerable now, I think, might be the Eight-Winged Tiger!"

Su Yu quickly said, "The Eight-Winged Tiger, Saint Marquis, Sun Corona, Moon Luo, and Wu Ji are all at the same level. As for the South Heavenly King, outside, she might also possess such combat power. Within the heavens and earth, the South Heavenly King shouldn't be weaker than the Chaos Dragon and the others!"

Perhaps even stronger, because this was Su Yu's world, and also the South Heavenly King's.

The true extreme of Heavenly Venerable is actually these people.

As for the Chaos Dragon and the others, in ancient times, if they were human, they might have been physical kings!

Everyone nodded slightly. With Su Yu's explanation, they had a clearer understanding.

On the side, March couldn't help but ask, "Your Majesty, what about us?"

"You all?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Ordinary Heavenly Venerables, what else?"

Ordinary Heavenly Venerables... Heavenly Venerables are Heavenly Venerables, adding 'ordinary' is really disheartening.

"Heavenly Venerables are actually about the same level!"

Su Yu smiled, "Except for the few I mentioned, who have reached the extreme in this domain, the rest aren't much different! It just means they've reached the extreme of this path, but their paths are slightly stronger than yours!"

Heavenly Venerables have almost no significant difference, those few are special, perhaps they have also cultivated his path.

At this moment, Heavendoom and the others were smart enough not to ask!

If they asked, it would surely be heartbreaking to hear.

Heavenly Venerables aren't even in the flow, let alone them.

Wan Tiansheng didn't mention these either, smiling, "Overall, we actually have the advantage over the Myriad Races. Your Majesty can handle the Divine Empress, Sun Corona and Saint Marquis, Fat Ball can cooperate with a Heavenly Venerable, and can even handle them alone! If that's the case... fighting the Myriad Races isn't too difficult!"

"The key is to minimize losses, or even avoid them..."

Su Yu nodded, "Fighting these people, I don't want my people to die... To put it bluntly... if there are deaths... it might be later!"

These words were somewhat somber.

Su Yu quickly recovered, "I don't want anyone to die, but if I take people to rescue the Human Emperor and the others, the opponents are over a hundred rulers of laws. At that time, it might be our life and death parting! The current Myriad Realms is actually a crushing battle, I don't want to see my people die here... it's not worth it!"

"We have many opponents, after defeating the Myriad Races, there's still the Gate of Hell, and the Heaven Gate, and perhaps unknown portals and eras..."

"They all converge in this era, converge here, converge in the Myriad Realms..."

Su Yu said solemnly, "The Myriad Realms, I feel, must have something attracting them, otherwise, chaos should be limitless, and the heavens can be opened anywhere, they can survive anywhere, why must they fight to the death here?"

"This era is special, this place is special..."

Su Yu said solemnly, "So, the future is the key! Before that, it's time for us to accumulate strength, not the time to die!"

"Of course, we fear death, but we dare to die!"

As these words were spoken.

Everyone was deep in thought.

Indeed, various eras converge, all seemingly about to unseal, is the Myriad Realms a special place?

Or is this era truly special?

What's special about it?

Here, the most special is probably the River of Time, because many Daos, including Su Yu's Dao, the opening of the heavens, actually borrowed from the River of Time, even stealing its power.

The Master of Time is probably the strongest in countless eras, right?

Such a terrifying existence, almost no one has seen, where exactly is it?

Is the Master of Time dead?

Everyone fell into contemplation.

It was the Great Zhou King who once again broke the silence, "Your Majesty, should we now make a move against the Myriad Races, or continue to lie low, waiting for them to find our world and act within it? Can the Tea Plant's plan still be implemented?"

The Chaos Dragon and others know that Su Yu has opened the heavens, the Martial Emperor knows, the Undead Emperor knows, and now many know.

Su Yu's plan was actually quite easy for outsiders to discern.

Su Yu chuckled, "It's just like catching rabbits while gathering grass—an incidental task! We wait for Hundred Battle to make the first move. If he doesn't block the Sin Clan, how can we deal with the myriad races? Even if he's just putting on a show, he'll have to act!"

"Of course, we need to create some pressure first, forcing him to take action..."

At this point, Su Yu's expression turned serious. "Fat Ball, Tongtian, Lantian, Great Zhou King, Giant Axe, and March, the six of you Heavenly Venerables, heed my command!"

The six powerful figures responded in unison.

"I command you to lead Marquis Lanshan, Marquis Huoyun, Marquis Yingwu, Great Qin King, Great Xia King, and all the generals, commanding fifty Daofuse cultivators, to head to the Upper Realm and besiege the myriad races, trapping them at Ren Mountain!"

Everyone's hearts trembled!

Six Heavenly Venerables, numerous Heavenly Kings, and dozens of Daofuse cultivators. Marquis Lanshan and Marquis Huoyun, one a pseudo-Heavenly Venerable and the other close to becoming one, both had the potential to quickly achieve true Heavenly Venerable combat strength.

If so, eight Heavenly Venerables besieging the myriad races would be a formidable force!

Moreover, there were quite a few Heavenly Kings, and the Daofuse cultivators numbered fifty!

The myriad races had many Daofuse cultivators, but they had also lost a batch previously.

Such pressure was enough to make the myriad races feel immense pressure, preventing them from recklessly leaving their mountain. Furthermore, Tiangu would not leave the mountain either.

Su Yu continued, "With our forces besieging Ren Mountain, Tiangu will certainly not feel at ease with Destiny... Before that, Wuming, go meet Marquis Destiny and have them withdraw!"

The Fate Emperor spoke solemnly, "Your Majesty, should we guard the passage to the Fate Realm..."

Currently, most people might choose to use the passage through Soul Burying Mountain, but the Fate Clan also had a passage, now unobstructed. However, with the suppressive power in the Fate Realm, not everyone dared to use it.

Su Yu smiled, "Whether we guard it or not doesn't matter now. It's completely open, so there's no need to pay much attention! The Fate Clan should best evacuate the Fate Realm. Otherwise, if someone wants to come down and suddenly uses the Fate Realm passage, it won't be safe!"

Su Yu quickly added, "Before our forces besiege the enemy, before both sides completely tear off the facade, Tiangu and the others are still unsure if I really intend to act. Have Destiny evacuate immediately to avoid a situation where Tiangu, in a fit of ruthlessness, wipes them out!"

As for Thunderstorm... that's not my concern; it's Hundred Battle's issue.

The Fate Emperor quickly nodded and left.

He needed to have the Fate Clan evacuate before Su Yu's forces besieged the enemy.

Meanwhile, others swiftly gathered their respective powerful figures and subordinates, preparing for battle. This time, Su Yu mobilized Daofuse combat strength. Previously, only top-tier experts from Su Yu's side had participated in battles.

But this time, the myriad races had many Daofuse cultivators as well. Even ants can bite an elephant to death; having Daofuse cultivators participate was necessary.

...

Su Yu did not travel through chaos to the Upper Realm.

On the second day after reaching an agreement with Hundred Battle, suddenly, deathly aura surged across the myriad realms!

From the direction of the Abyssal Realm, a torrential aura erupted in an instant.

Six Heavenly Venerables, seven or eight Heavenly Kings, and dozens of Daofuse cultivators, their powerful auras shook the heavens and earth, intimidating all directions!

At this moment, led by the Great Zhou King, a soft shout echoed in all directions, "The Imperial Palace of Emperor Yu is setting out! Conquer the Upper Realm, reclaim the inherent territory of our Human Race! Proclaim the might of our Human Race! Non-enemy camp experts, retreat!"

A soft shout, and the myriad realms trembled.

At this moment, the experts of the myriad realms realized that Su Yu had unknowingly accumulated such a powerful force!

Dozens of Daofuse cultivators!

A multitude of Heavenly Venerables and Heavenly Kings!

...

At this moment.

In the Human Realm.

A group of people silently watched, feeling complex emotions. So many!

And there were some familiar faces.

Marquis Huoyun, General Yingwu, Marquis Dingjun—these people were also participating in the battle this time, their auras formidable. Clearly, at this point, Su Yu no longer cared about the previous failed disguises and the deaths of many in battle.

At this moment, aside from continuing to hide some Heavenly Venerables, Su Yu had revealed a large number of powerful figures to intimidate all directions.

Without some strong figures, how could they mix?

How could they fight?

"There are quite a few Heavenly Venerables..."

Someone murmured, "Su Yu himself hasn't come, and Destiny seems to still be in the Upper Realm! Adding them, that's eight Heavenly Venerables. Moreover, Lantian and the others aren't dead. What about Wan Tiansheng? Has he also become a Heavenly Venerable? Besides Wan Tiansheng, is there anyone else?"

A group of people, at this moment, had some understanding of Su Yu's side.

Hongmeng hasn't appeared. Has he become a Heavenly Venerable?

No one knows!

Strictly speaking, Hundred Battle's side had accumulated power for countless years. Purely in terms of Heavenly Venerables, Heavenly Kings, and Daofuse cultivators, Su Yu's side had about the same number. However, Hundred Battle's side had an advantage at this moment, and that was Hundred Battle himself.

At this moment, the aura on that side was like a rainbow, murderous intent soaring!

A grand scene of setting out for battle!

On the Human Realm side, some people looked longingly at that side, someone muttering, "Su Yu and the others have set out. When will we take action?"

We agreed to fight together, attacking one side.

Su Yu and his entire army have moved out!

What about us?

...

In the Human Realm, at Hundred Battle's residence.

At this moment, Hundred Battle silently watched the sky, with only a few Heavenly Venerables by his side.

Su Yu had dispatched his troops!

The speed was astonishing!

The agreed three months, and Su Yu set out on the second day, with no intention of delaying.

Speed is of the essence in warfare!

Moreover, Su Yu had a strong grip on his people. When he declared the expedition, all were strong figures. At this moment, he hadn't mobilized forces below Daofuse, so the speed was naturally faster.

Hundred Battle remained silent.

Below, Wu Ji appeared impatient, "Your Majesty, when will we go to fight?"

Hundred Battle looked down at him, smiling, "Itching for a fight?"

"A little!"

Wu Ji grinned, "Fighting and killing is more interesting than closed-door cultivation... Besides, it's been too many years, and I haven't been in battle. I'm also a bit impatient!"

Hundred Battle chuckled, "You! Well, I won't disappoint you!"

"Wu Ji, heed my command!"

"Here!"

Wu Ji shouted loudly, and Hundred Battle smiled, "Wu Ji, take Yue Luo, Yue Xiao, Hong Yue, Blood Shadow, and call Thunderstorm. The six of you will lead, recruit ten Heavenly Kings, and thirty Daofuse cultivators, and head to the Upper Realm to confront the Sin Clan. Remember, do not rashly start a war! The other side might have the Poba Dragon Beast out now. Focus on defense and confrontation first... I will choose the right time to join the battle in the Upper Realm!"

He left only a small portion of people, over fifty strong figures, leaving less than twenty behind, entrusting the rest to Wu Ji.

Hundred Battle added with a smile, "Your character is reckless, do not act rashly! Originally, I wanted Changqing to go with you, but there are still some matters between Changqing and me to handle... This time, you must listen to others' opinions! Hong Yue and Blood Shadow are calmer than you. Long Mei doesn't get along with you or with Hong Yue and the others, so I won't let him go, to avoid endless trouble when I'm not around!"

Wu Ji was excited, "Your Majesty, I will be cautious! Thank you, Your Majesty!"

"Go!"

Hundred Battle smiled, "Also, do not get into conflict with Su Yu and his people! Be a bit tolerant. As long as they don't interfere with your actions, don't cause trouble, don't fight among ourselves, understand?"

"Understood!"

Wu Ji was extremely excited, "Your Majesty, then... shall I gather everyone now?"

"Go!"

"Thank you, Your Majesty!"

Wu Ji was overjoyed and rushed out instantly.

Among the crowd, Hong Yue and the others exchanged glances. Hong Yue slightly bowed, "Your Majesty, then we... shall go too!"

"Go!"

Hundred Battle nodded slightly, "Be careful, after all, the other side has several rulers of laws, do not act rashly. If there is a crisis, I will intervene! Also, if there is a crisis and I can't arrive in time... you can seek help from Su Yu!"

Hundred Battle smiled, "I wouldn't say this to Wu Ji, he has his pride, and would rather die than ask for help! But with you, I am more at ease. Remember, life is key. Although Su Yu is not very satisfied with me... as fellow humans, I don't want anything to happen to you, and neither does he. If there's trouble, he will still come to your aid..."

"We understand!"

Blood Shadow and the others responded in a low tone, and soon, everyone left.

With Su Yu's side setting out, now Hundred Battle also responded, setting out!

The forces of the Human Realm officially set out to conquer the Upper Realm!

...

A storm is brewing!

At this moment, in the Upper Realm, the rules were shaking.

A great battle was about to begin.

The grievances and grudges of ten thousand years might find a resolution within three months, finally coming to an end!

...

Atop Ren Mountain.

The Divine Empress had returned, and Destiny and Thunderstorm had also fled with their people.

At this moment, Heavenly Venerable Huang was extremely dissatisfied, "Tiangu, why didn't you keep Destiny and Thunderstorm? Before the Human Race arrives, we should eliminate them first. After all, they will be our enemies!"

"You heard what Su Yu said!"

Heavenly Venerable Huang shouted, "Don't be delusional, thinking you can surrender to Su Yu... It's impossible! Even if Su Yu accepts some people surrendering, it won't be us, and certainly not you, Tiangu! You've ruled the Immortal Race for ten thousand years. The number of humans who died under your rule, if not ten billion, is still in the billions!"

"Su Yu declared before the myriad realms that blood debts must be repaid. Are you still thinking of surrendering?"

Blood feud!

A blood feud that has lasted ten thousand years!

In one tide, the Human Race lost over a billion people. In ten thousand years, ten tides, how many have died? Probably not many remember.

The Immortal Race, as one of the three major races, with Tiangu as its ruler, may not have personally killed many, but all debts are attributed to him, a towering blood feud!

Anyone might surrender to Su Yu, but Tiangu... it's impossible.

At this moment, Tiangu silently gazed into the distance, not responding.

Surrender?

He hadn't considered it. Su Yu was not like others; he was Su Yu. He wouldn't spare people like him. Tiangu was merely contemplating, if truly defeated, could Su Yu only execute the chief culprits...

In this tide, the Immortal Race hadn't fought much against the Human Race because they were allies before!

They had formed an alliance!

So, in this tide, the enmity between the Immortal Race and the Human Race wasn't too deep.

Of course, the older generation was a different story, with enmity as deep as the sea.

He... was already contemplating defeat.

It was pessimistic, but it was also the reality.

Su Yu rarely led an army into direct battle. When such a situation arose, it meant Su Yu believed it was a crushing victory. He understood Su Yu.

Su Yu already believed he could crush the myriad races.

In Su Yu's eyes, even the possibility of the Control King's faction and the Hundred Battle King's faction turning against each other was something he had considered. He might not be able to defeat all three factions, but he had the confidence to protect himself.

With such confidence, how could the myriad races hope to fight?

As a commander, he shouldn't show fear before the battle, and he didn't. But Tiangu knew that deep down, he was filled with despair and pessimism. This battle was destined to be lost! Even if the Divine Emperor's Consort broke through, defeat was inevitable!

He paid no mind to the roars of the Desolate Heavenly Venerable. What did it matter if Destiny was killed? What did it matter if the Fate Clan was destroyed? Doing so would only sever the last thread of hope—not his hope, but the hope of the new generation of the Immortal Clan.

"As long as the race survives... there is still hope!"

"As long as the torch of inheritance is passed on, there is still a possibility!"

Tiangu thought silently. If the older generation, the powerful ones, were defeated, Su Yu would surely kill them! But the new generation... not necessarily! If the Myriad Realms were all human, wouldn't that be less interesting? If a race were truly exterminated, and if the Immortal Emperors survived and returned, they would have nothing to hold them back and would go on a rampage!

"So, there is still hope for the race to survive..."

He pondered how to ensure the Immortal Clan wouldn't be exterminated after their defeat. At the moment, it seemed there was hope, but with Su Yu as the opponent, a man who didn't play by the rules, nothing was certain!

Tiangu gazed silently into the distance for a while. Suddenly, a surge of auras shot into the sky! The Human Realm's army had arrived! The ten-thousand-year entanglement of the Myriad Realms was nearing its end.

Tiangu smiled, stood up, and in the next moment, shouted, "Prepare for battle!"

Even in defeat, they must fight! They must not let the humans look down on the myriad races! On the battlefield, heroes are made!
