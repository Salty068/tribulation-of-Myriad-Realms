Chapter 813: Integrating the Book of Time

The battle continued.

On Su Yu's side, they were using the myriad races to gain combat experience, enhance their battle awareness, and deepen their understanding of the Dao. The older generation of experts didn't lack these, but the new generation did. The battle was almost a passive way for Su Yu's side to increase their strength, while the myriad races had no choice but to comply.

Deep within the chaos.

Su Yu wasn't in the Upper Realm; instead, he was in his own world. There were still many strong individuals here. Although seven Heavenly Venerables had left, Wan Tiansheng, the South Heavenly King, and Hongmeng were outside with Heavenly Venerable-level combat power. Inside, there were also the West King's Consort, Tianhuo, and several other experts nearing this level.

Before the mountain of people, the battle between the humans and the myriad races was almost broadcast live to Su Yu's side. He was aware of everything, thanks to Lantian. The Lantian communication device was invaluable, allowing seamless communication as long as there were no barriers or domain restrictions.

"Great Zhou King..." Su Yu murmured. Beside him, Wan Tiansheng nonchalantly remarked, "When he said His Majesty was talking nonsense, it was just a way to establish authority. He didn't mean it literally. His Majesty shouldn't mind him saying that. The Great Zhou King didn't mean it!"

He repeated himself several times, afraid Su Yu would forget the Great Zhou King's words. Su Yu was speechless, casting a glance at Wan Tiansheng, who was slyly mischievous. Previously, during a breakthrough, Wan Tiansheng had suffered a minor setback against the Great Zhou King, and it seemed he still remembered it.

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to respond. The Great Zhou King still needed a beating, but he'd wait for the right opportunity. As for the battle of generals, Su Yu had proposed it, but he had indeed said not to kill anyone. The Great Zhou King had made slight adjustments, and Su Yu didn't mind. He didn't want deaths, but in a real war, casualties were common. Su Yu wasn't that fragile.

At this moment, Su Yu wasn't concerned about these matters. He smiled and said, "As expected, Tiangu and the others agreed!"

Including Tianming, seven Heavenly Venerables had gone. Compared to their strength, they were inferior to the myriad races. Yet, the myriad races still didn't dare to attack, which was within Su Yu's expectations. The opposing commander was Tiangu, after all.

Su Yu chuckled, "Tiangu... how should I put it? He's intelligent and has courage, but he overthinks. It's not about being reckless, but Tiangu lacks a certain boldness. At this moment, if he truly wanted to take a risk, he should charge out!"

Being passive might be a strategy, but can you really seize an opportunity by dragging it out for three months? Not necessarily! Tiangu understood Su Yu, and Su Yu understood him. In previous battles, Tiangu rarely left his domain, inherently cautious. Several times, Su Yu tried to trap Tiangu but failed.

It's a good trait, but sometimes it can be a disadvantage. For instance, Su Yu was certain that with Tiangu in charge, he would agree to the battle of generals. If Dao Heavenly Venerable or Huang Heavenly Venerable were in charge, the battle might not have happened.

Wan Tiansheng pondered and said, "Indeed, Tiangu is skilled in strategy. However, sometimes the myriad realms don't need strategy; they need strength!"

Strategy is needed only when strength is insufficient. When strength is sufficient, one can sweep through everything! The Martial Emperor is a third-tier ruler of laws. If he were a first-tier, at the level of the Human Emperor, what strategy, what scheme, what nonsense? He would just sweep through everything, killing anyone who dared to block him!

Su Yu nodded slightly. Soon, he stopped concerning himself with those matters. For now, nothing would happen over there. A little caution was all that was needed.

At this moment, Su Yu wasn't staying here to act aloof. The South Heavenly King and others gathered around. Su Yu quickly said, "I want to swiftly conquer the myriad realms and bring peace to the chaos! But with my strength alone, I can't match the three factions! The best way is to ally with one and fight the other two!"

Ally with one faction to fight the other two.

Everyone looked at him. Was Su Yu planning to ally with the myriad races? As for Hundred Battles, they were already allied on the surface, but Su Yu's words indicated he didn't trust Hundred Battles. The Sin Clan... Su Yu probably wouldn't ally with them. Of course, Su Yu often acted unexpectedly, so it was hard to say.

Su Yu looked at everyone and continued, "Don't think about other things. I haven't considered allying with the Sin Clan! The myriad races are indeed my current target for alliance... but it's not enough!"

Everyone looked at Su Yu, wondering what he meant by "not enough."

Su Yu smiled, "Not enough means lacking a catalyst, or rather, lacking a step that forces the myriad races to cooperate and obey!"

The South Heavenly King said coldly, "Why don't we all show up and intimidate the myriad races? It's not enough now!"

Seven Heavenly Venerables weren't enough. The myriad races couldn't feel the pressure.

Su Yu nodded, "That's one way, but it's not enough! Besides... the war with the myriad races can't end so easily. It's best to kill one or two Heavenly Venerables to intimidate the myriad races! Without dead Heavenly Venerables, how would they listen?"

Saying this, Su Yu smiled again, "That's still not enough. I need to do something else!"

Everyone looked at him again. What else did he want to do?

Su Yu smiled, "Capture all the gods, demons, and immortals secretly!"

"Everyone?"

Everyone was stunned!

Su Yu nodded, "Everyone! We have the weapon space! So, I want to capture everyone from the three major races... They think we won't exterminate them, but..."

Su Yu said coldly, "I will! If the myriad races don't listen, I'll exterminate them! If they listen, I'll hand them over, let them leave, and enter the Gate of Hell together. Whether they survive or not depends on themselves!"

"Of course, before that, I'll give them a chance to survive!"

Su Yu said softly, "If they agree to cooperate... that's when I'll break the seal!"

Break the seal!

Many looked at the distant Monitor Marquis. Did Su Yu mean that if the myriad races agreed to cooperate, he would help them break the seal and promote them to rulers of laws?

Wan Tiansheng said solemnly, "But after breaking the seal, if the myriad races gain a few more rulers of laws and think they can turn the tables, unwilling to leave the myriad realms, what then?"

Su Yu smiled, "Can they turn the tables with a few more rulers of laws? If they have more, won't we have more too? More rulers of laws just means they have a better chance of surviving behind the Gate of Hell... a greater chance of living!"

Wan Tiansheng frowned, "That's the best outcome, but I'm afraid..."

Su Yu smiled, "Of course, there's a prerequisite. For example, after killing Yu Qing and Po Long, I'll help them unseal!"

Everyone thought for a moment and nodded.

Su Yu continued, "Capturing the myriad races also cuts off their hopes. The myriad races are reluctant to leave, unwilling to go, and they think we won't dare to deal with their clansmen... After all, the Immortal Emperor is still alive!"

"Using this as a catalyst and threat, we can drive them away!"

The South Heavenly King also said solemnly, "But doing so breaks some unspoken rules. In future wars, capturing ordinary clansmen to threaten the strong might become a thing!"

It's an unspoken rule, not explicitly stated, but everyone follows it. Su Yu was breaking such a rule. It might cause some trouble in the future.

Su Yu nodded, "I know, but... future matters can be dealt with in the future. At least for now, there won't be any trouble."

Su Yu continued, "This is actually a minor issue. Hundred Battles has been persisting with his plan for six thousand years. He won't change just because I forced him once! This time, Hundred Battles sent Wu Ji and others, but he didn't show up himself. What's he doing in the Human Realm?"

"Hundred Battles is unlikely to openly turn against me, but in secret, who knows?"

"So, we must guard against Hundred Battles!"

"Not only guard, but also find ways to deal with him... Even though I'm not sure if he's truly persistent, we must prepare to deal with Hundred Battles!"

"And then there's Thunderstorm. He knows something about my world opening. Although he's still in the Upper Realm, he might tell Hundred Battles..."

Upon hearing this, Wan Tiansheng frowned slightly, "Then why reveal it to him before?"

"Intimidation!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Thunderstorm said it, which is actually a good thing. Let Hundred Battles know I'm an opener of the heavens. Maybe he'll change his mind, or maybe... he'll be wary because my strength is too ambiguous! But if I didn't have such a trump card, do you think Hundred Battles would be wary of us?"

Revealing it was actually a good thing, a deterrent.

Su Yu continued, "If Thunderstorm didn't say it, that's also a good thing. Hundred Battles might really want to deal with me, but he doesn't know about my world opening. In this way, my strength and trump card wouldn't be in his plans! This is twofold preparation and twofold choice!"

It's a choice Su Yu gave to Hundred Battles and Thunderstorm. Whether to say it or not... whether Hundred Battles would act against him or not would lead to different outcomes.

Everyone pondered for a while and nodded slightly.

However, Wan Tiansheng regretted, "Then the plan to attract people with the Tea Plant won't be used!"

A bit of a pity, he thought it was quite useful. What a shame!

Su Yu smiled, "Not necessarily!"

Of course, that's a matter for later.

Su Yu stood up, "So, this time, I stayed behind to handle a few things. First, capture people, entering from the Death Realm! Just like last time, capture them silently!"

"Second, hunt the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger in the chaos. These two unexpected factors must be resolved, whether by killing or capturing. There must be a result!"

He disliked any unexpected factors appearing! They could disrupt his plans.

"Third..."

Su Yu paused for a moment and said, "I want to explore the Human Race's physical Dao and the Giant Race's physical Dao. I need to investigate carefully to see if there's a connection! I have the Heaven Gate to observe, but Hundred Battles might discover... If discovered, there might be a conflict, so be prepared!"

"Fourth..."

Su Yu looked at the crowd, especially at Wan Tiansheng and the others, and after a moment of silence, he said, "I originally didn't want everyone to integrate into my world too early, or rather, to give everyone more choices! But if any unforeseen events occur, I hope that those Heavenly Kings and Heavenly Venerables who haven't integrated into my dao will quickly do so, to strengthen my dao and make us all stronger!"

Upon hearing this, Wan Tiansheng laughed and said, "This isn't a problem; rather, it's an opportunity for us. If you need it, we can integrate now."

Su Yu smiled, "There's no rush. Let's take advantage of the River of Time a bit more; it's too vast!"

As he spoke, Su Yu said softly, "The River of Time... it's incredibly powerful, and not just now. It seems it has been unbelievably strong since the beginning of the world!"

That implies that from the very start, it was already extraordinarily powerful. The Master of Time, before the world began, what kind of strength did they possess? A terrifying existence! Perhaps even before the world began, they could have easily defeated everyone.

"Let's move!" Su Yu commanded, "I won't participate in capturing people. I'll focus on opening some passages and contacting various realms!"

Although he had severed contact with Xingyue, it didn't matter. Xingyue was no longer a spirit of death, and Su Yu could open the passages himself. Having mastered the Great Dao of Life and Death, it was even easier for him to traverse between the realms of life and death.

Everyone nodded, and Su Yu waved his hand, creating an avatar with balanced life and death energy. "He will help you open the passages. Keep it low-key, don't let the myriad races find out prematurely. Focus on the three major races. Any race with a Heavenly Venerable can be targeted. Those without... it doesn't matter."

The South Heavenly King asked, "Should I go too?"

"Yes, go, all of you!" Su Yu laughed, "This small world is too stifling for you all. Since your revival, you haven't been out. Go out and take a look at the Myriad Realms!"

Hearing this, no one said more. Here were some powerful beings; ordinary people were in the Abyssal Realm, freely coming and going in chaos.

Soon, Wan Tiansheng led the group away swiftly. The vast world suddenly felt empty, leaving only the imprisoned Marquis of Monitoring Heaven.

...

After everyone left, Su Yu leaned back in his chair, lost in thought. In the distance, the Marquis of Monitoring Heaven silently glanced at him.

At this moment, Su Yu suddenly took out a treasure, which floated before him, and he hesitated. The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven's face changed slightly, and he suddenly spoke, "You've sent everyone away. Are you planning to integrate the Book of Time into your world?"

"Su Yu, do you not even trust your own people?"

Was Su Yu planning to secretly enhance his strength? But wouldn't those who have integrated into the dao sense it?

Su Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, "The more you know, the quicker you die!"

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven fell silent. Su Yu chuckled and continued, "It's not about trust, but... too many people knowing would mean no trump card left!"

Su Yu smiled warmly, then added, "This is a treasure left by the Time Sage, the foundation of her Great Dao. It's also the key to my rise..."

Su Yu sighed, "I actually want to keep it, to return it to the Time Sage when I meet her! When I opened the heavens before, I didn't use this item. I thought I could keep it. This Book of Time provided me with the best foundation for my rise, and now, I'm hesitating whether to shatter it and integrate it into my world."

Su Yu hesitated, lamenting, "The Time Sage isn't dead! But if I shatter the Book of Time... all her preparations over countless years would be cut off by me!"

Breaking the Book of Time would essentially sever the Time Sage's path to opening the heavens. Frankly, if she were an enemy, this would be an irreconcilable grudge!

But since the Time Sage had thrown the Book of Time out, she probably didn't intend to take it back. Su Yu could break it himself, and besides, last time he asked Fat Ball, who said that as long as Su Yu could save people, breaking it was fine!

Su Yu rarely hesitated like this. Today, however, he was somewhat indecisive. If he severed the Time Sage's path, would she still have hope of opening the heavens? Although she might not even survive, considering these things was premature. But in reality, Su Yu could choose not to break the Book of Time.

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven noticed Su Yu's hesitation and suddenly laughed, "Isn't Emperor Yu always decisive? It's just an external object. Why is Emperor Yu hesitating today?"

He found it strange. Su Yu, who was usually fearless, was hesitating.

"You don't understand!" Su Yu smiled faintly, "I have no other virtues. I'm selfish, vengeful, malicious, and ruthless... but I fear owing favors! Returning the Book of Time to the Time Sage, saving her, would settle the debt, a business transaction!"

"Her Book of Time fulfilled me, and I saved her, returning the Book of Time to her, ending the transaction..."

"But if I break the Book of Time, severing her path, that's not good."

Su Yu continued, smiling, "And another thing..."

Su Yu's smile faded, "I'm wondering if she left some core imprint in the Book of Time. If I shatter it, will she perish, or if she's in a battle, will her strength suddenly drop, leading to her death? I wouldn't be able to explain that."

These were his hesitations. Beyond the Heaven Gate, he couldn't communicate with her. Last time was just luck, unless Su Yu died again now and found a way to break the Heaven Gate's illusion.

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven looked at him. Today, Su Yu was unusually considerate of others, even a stranger!

"Emperor Yu... is also quite complex."

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven murmured. Sometimes Su Yu was terrifyingly cold-blooded, and other times he was indecisive. Logically, since the Book of Time could enhance him, there should be no hesitation.

Yet from the time he opened the heavens until now, Su Yu hadn't mentioned integrating the Book of Time until now, feeling the pressure, he considered it.

"You, a person who attained the dao through fortune, don't understand these things!"

Su Yu laughed, standing up, "I wasn't really hesitating. Integration... is already decided. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let everyone leave! I said all this just to see your reaction!"

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven was stunned. What did he mean?

Su Yu laughed, "Since you're so calm, it means you didn't see any fluctuations in fortune or sense anything... The Time Sage is a crucial part of the ancient times, a core combat force. Since you didn't react, it means she probably won't die. Good, I'm relieved!"

"......"

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven was dumbfounded. Was this even possible?

He... indeed had no reaction.

"Emperor Yu... why not just ask me directly?"

Su Yu chuckled, "You're an enemy. If I asked you, would you tell me the truth? Nonsense! I wouldn't believe you! Even if you said it, I wouldn't trust you. But now, this natural reaction, I believe. Thank you!"

"......"

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven wanted to curse! Shameless scoundrel! Su Yu was as shameless as ever. I thought so, this guy suddenly lamenting in front of me, waxing poetic, was just to see my reaction, to check if the Time Sage would be in trouble. Truly shameless!

He had to complicate a simple question.

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven closed his eyes, ignoring him. Su Yu was always this shameless. If I believe he'll be sentimental next time, I'll be a fool. I thought, why would he discuss such an important matter in front of me?

At this moment, Su Yu, having burned his bridges, waved his hand, enveloping the Marquis of Monitoring Heaven, preventing him from seeing further. You're a prisoner, just serve as my fortune detector! As for anything else, what are you looking at? Just be a prisoner obediently!

The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven felt exhausted, closing his eyes, not caring anymore. Do as you please! In his heart, however, he was somewhat shaken. Would Su Yu become even more powerful after integrating the Book of Time? Certainly! It just depended on how powerful he would become. The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven could actually sense some of it. Su Yu, even now, was part of the ancient legacy, not completely detached.

If Su Yu became incredibly powerful, the Marquis of Monitoring Heaven would also grow stronger. "Is there going to be another enhancement?" The Marquis of Monitoring Heaven thought. In fact, as time passed, he had already felt Su Yu's continuous growth. Although he was imprisoned now, his strength was actually increasing. Currently, he was vaguely at the Heavenly Venerable level. "A terrifying guy!"

Su Yu only provided him with a tiny bit of fortune power. After all, Su Yu had opened the heavens himself, partially detaching. If Su Yu hadn't detached at all, perhaps the Marquis of Monitoring Heaven would be even stronger now!

...

Su Yu no longer paid attention to the Marquis of Monitoring Heaven. Inside the Human Lord Seal, Su Yu took out the Book of Time. At this moment, the pages of the Book of Time were flipping continuously. Page after page unfolded.

"Iron-winged Bird" "Mountain-breaking Bull" "Bright Bird" "Suanni" "Mountain-drilling Bull" "..."

Page after page appeared, with illustrations and text. Only now could Su Yu see the full appearance of the Book of Time. The writing was elegant, different from Su Yu's. It must have been written by the Time Sage. The Book of Time was golden and dazzling. On the cover, where Su Yu previously couldn't see any words, there seemed to be no title. But today, two words faintly appeared.

"Recipe!"

Yes, recipe! Su Yu was stunned. He hadn't looked closely before. He rubbed his eyes, looked again, and still saw the two words—recipe! Su Yu was stunned again, rubbed his eyes! Still the same two words—recipe! Su Yu was completely dumbfounded!

What did this mean? Recipe? What the hell! "This... this woman is so ruthless!" Su Yu shivered. My goodness, you call this a recipe? My goodness, this includes gods, demons, and immortals. Do you eat even them? You're too ruthless! The key is, even your own dog is on it. Do you eat that too?

Su Yu grimaced, feeling the ruthlessness of the Time Sage for the first time. What Book of Time, what Myriad Laws Diagram, none of that. She named her weapon of proving the dao as a recipe!

Su Yu couldn't help but marvel at the thought, "So, this person initially intended to be a chef rather than a Time Sage?"

"Impressive!" Su Yu admired the feat. A chef who ultimately created the Book of Time—truly admirable!

Amused yet contemplative, Su Yu mused, "Since it's a recipe book... there's no harm in integrating it, right?"

He glanced at his Source of Myriad Daos and then at the Book of Time. The Book of Time, crafted by the Time Sage, was formidable. Although difficult to collect, the Time Sage was a supreme existence, having spent years comprehending the Dao, with the Culture King as her brother, who also had profound insights into the Dao.

Strictly speaking, some of Su Yu's myriad powers might not be as strong as those collected by the Time Sage. Once integrated, even if there was some loss, it could still result in an accumulation of Dao power.

"Let's start with those Dao powers that no one else has integrated..." Su Yu pondered for a moment. He didn't plan to let everyone know just yet, nor did he intend for everyone to improve immediately. Even if he integrated Daos that others had already merged with, Su Yu would temporarily seal the insights.

This was his trump card. If everything was exposed, how could he mount a counterattack?

"Apologies!" Su Yu chuckled. In the next moment, the Book of Time trembled and cracked slightly. A page was torn out and drifted towards a Dao.

This was the Rip Dao, the innate ability of the Iron-winged Bird Race, and also the first skill Su Yu practiced when he first opened the Book of Time.

In an instant, the page merged into Su Yu's Rip Dao. Su Yu's Dao transformed into an Iron-winged Bird, pouncing towards the page. On the page, a lifelike Iron-winged Bird emerged.

The two Iron-winged Birds clashed fiercely. Su Yu's bird, bolstered by his presence and the advantage of being in his own world, quickly tore apart the Time Sage's page and devoured the Iron-winged Bird depicted on it.

Boom!

A loud explosion echoed, and within the world, the Rip Dao suddenly grew stronger, enhancing the entire myriad Daos. The world expanded slightly.

It was a subtle change, but this was just one Dao. This single page brought Su Yu a slight enhancement, which was difficult at his level. Yet, the Book of Time achieved it.

Su Yu was, in a sense, the Time Sage's successor. His Daos were inspired by the Book of Time and the Time Sage. Strictly speaking, he was indeed the Time Sage's heir. Thus, the compatibility with everyone's Daos was high.

Most of Su Yu's insights into the Dao also came from the Book of Time. Their understanding of the Dao was almost identical!

Page after page was torn from the Book of Time by Su Yu. Each of Su Yu's Dao powers voraciously devoured the Time Sage's Dao powers.

The world began to expand!

...

Inside the Human Lord Seal.

Marquis Tianjian couldn't see or hear anything, but he sensed it. He felt his Luck Dao improving, and his strength was also increasing.

This meant that Su Yu was also continuously improving. It was a terrifying thought!

Su Yu was already strong, but such a noticeable improvement... To what extent would Su Yu grow?

The Book of Time left by the Time Sage was immensely beneficial to Su Yu. This was, in fact, the last gift from the ancient era to Su Yu. After devouring the Book of Time, Su Yu would no longer have any gifts from the ancient times.

Su Yu sealed the enhancement of other Daos but did not seal the enhancement of the Life and Death Dao.

...

At this moment.

Upstream of the River of Time, Xingyue was healing someone when suddenly, her aura fluctuated. In the blink of an eye, two forces intertwined—Life and Death!

Amidst the surprised gazes of others, Xingyue's aura suddenly surged.

The power of Life and Death fluctuated!

It seemed that while healing others, she gained some insights and instantly improved.

Is this even possible?

Around her, some were shocked. Could this really happen?

In the distance, Radiant King was also taken aback, "Xingyue, you... you've improved again?"

This wasn't the first time!

The key was that the flow of time here was slower than in the Myriad Realms. Su Yu hadn't opened the heavens for long. In other words, here, Xingyue seemed to improve every so often, and then... she suddenly made a significant leap!

Originally, Xingyue wasn't particularly strong. According to the Great Zhou King's previous assessment, at the end of the ancient era, Xingyue was only a fourth-tier ruler of laws, inferior to the Martial Emperor.

But now... after multiple improvements, she had suddenly stepped into the third-tier.

Of course, that was in the past. Now, she naturally wasn't as strong as the Battle King, whom the Great Zhou King defined as third-tier.

However, Xingyue had been dead for many years and had only recently been resurrected. In the blink of an eye, she had entered the third tier, which shocked Radiant King and the others.

What was going on?

Xingyue herself was also extremely surprised. The enhancement of the Life and Death Dao wasn't due to her own insights but because Su Yu's Life and Death Dao had suddenly strengthened.

Why?

What had Su Yu comprehended?

Or had he obtained some fortuitous encounter?

"Was it Wenyu's recipe?" She suddenly thought of something. Could it be that?

Not entirely sure!

But it was possible.

The enhancement of the Life and Death Dao was not easy for Su Yu. Wenyu's recipe might contain some insights into the Life and Death Dao, such as those of the Immortal Clan or the Death Spirit Clan, all recorded in the recipe.

At this moment, seeing everyone looking at her, Xingyue said indifferently, "Just some normal insights. Having been dead for many years, my understanding of the Life and Death Dao has deepened. Plus, helping you all heal has brought some small gains!"

"......"

Everyone gasped. This was considered a small gain?

You just advanced a tier!

Some of the rulers of laws present hadn't reached this level even after many years.

In the distance, Radiant King also sighed, "Your progress is too fast. If this were back in the day, you would almost catch up to me..."

Back then, he was considered second-tier.

Of course, many years had passed, and his strength was different now.

But Xingyue's progress was still too fast!

Moreover, Xingyue's indifferent, nonchalant tone—what was that about?

Radiant King felt a bit uneasy. This tone... was really... really pretentious, yet he couldn't refute it.

Xingyue wasn't like this before. She used to be a quiet, sensible girl. Why was she acting so pretentious now?

Shouldn't you be overjoyed?

With your attitude of "I'm just that awesome," if you were an enemy, I'd want to kill you, you know?

Radiant King was helpless. Forget it, why bother with Xingyue?

"Good thing. This way, Xingyue, it will be easier for you to heal everyone..."

Radiant King smiled, "Keep comprehending. I believe you will surpass that fart-loving guy on the other side sooner or later!"

He was referring to the Immortal Emperor!

Xingyue remained indifferent, "Inevitably!"

"......"

Damn you!

Radiant King was speechless. I was just saying, little girl, you're too arrogant. This isn't appropriate!

But Xingyue didn't care. What's wrong?

Is there a problem?

Su Yu opened the heavens, and his progress was always rapid. Here, the flow of time was different from the Myriad Realms. Su Yu reached this level in just a few years, and maybe soon, he would become even stronger.

By then, as the master of the Life and Death Dao, I would naturally improve as well.

In the Myriad Realms, a year might not pass here for long.

In a year, could Su Yu reach the level of my brother?

If he did, then the gap between me and the Immortal Emperor wouldn't be large. Isn't that a normal thing?

So she took Radiant King's polite words seriously.

Radiant King had good judgment. He even knew I could surpass the Immortal Emperor on the other side. Hmm, good judgment. His descendant, the Great Ming King, also had good judgment. I heard he had long since pledged allegiance to Su Yu.

At this moment, strong individuals from all directions were grinning and baring their teeth.

This... His Majesty's sister seems... a bit arrogant!

The key is, she doesn't seem to realize how arrogant she is, speaking so casually, leaving everyone feeling helpless!

...

And at this moment, Su Yu was also feeling quite arrogant!

As the Daos continued to merge, the world expanded, and Su Yu's aura grew stronger. Suddenly, he laughed heartily, "What Hundred Battles, what Zhou Ji, dare to rebel, and I'll kill them all!"

A bunch of troublemakers!

I'm giving you a chance, don't waste it!

After integrating most of the Book of Time, Su Yu clearly felt his strength had grown significantly. At this moment, his aura was surging. If it weren't for being inside the Human Lord Seal, concealing his aura, if he were in the Myriad Realms, he would dare to fight Hundred Battles now!

Originally, Su Yu assessed himself as having the strength of a slightly weaker fourth-tier ruler of laws.

That was in the outside world!

Inside, Su Yu felt he was a strong fourth-tier, even approaching third-tier.

And at this moment, Su Yu felt that outside, he could fight Hundred Battles, and inside, he could single-handedly challenge the Martial Emperor!

The Martial Emperor was a truly top-tier third-tier powerhouse.

Su Yu grinned widely!

The Book of Time!

What a treasure!

The world continued to expand, but the Life and Death Dao had been integrated, and it was nearing the end. The entire Book of Time had few pages left.

Su Yu sealed some Dao powers, like the Fire Dao merged by Tianhuo and the Five Elemental Dao merged by Topsoil Spirit...

He sealed them all!

Otherwise, these people would also become significantly stronger.

But for now, forget it.

I like to surprise people!

Su Yu quickly began compressing his world, compressing it to the same size as before, making everyone think he hadn't improved, hehe!

When the critical moment comes, I'll punch one to death, leaving everyone dumbfounded!

And let the Myriad Races and Hundred Battles be dumbfounded too!

When rulers of laws emerge from my world, when numerous Heavenly Venerables and Heavenly Kings appear, they'll all be stunned!

At this moment, Su Yu was in an excellent mood.

The Book of Time had officially become his own.

This book, which had accompanied him since childhood, helping him through countless crises and laying the foundation for his growth, had now become an integral part of Su Yu's world.

"Suddenly... I feel a bit sentimental!" 

Su Yu said with a bright smile. It was somewhat insincere, as the sentimentality was only a tiny bit compared to the exhilaration of his newfound strength!

(End of Chapter)
