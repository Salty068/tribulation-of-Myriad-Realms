Chapter 734: Preparing for Deployment

Su Yu disguised himself as April, while Lantian took on the guise of Full Moon. The two had already reached an agreement, leaving September's objections ineffective. With a simple arrangement, everyone quickly reached a consensus. Wan Tiansheng and the others would temporarily hide among the Iron Devourer Race, ready to act on Su Yu's command at any moment.

...

For the second Myriad Race Conference, March would personally attend from the Iron Devourer Race, accompanied by Su Yu and Lantian, while Marquis Giant Bamboo would remain to guard Bamboo Mountain. On the second day of their arrival, the trio set off towards Ren Mountain.

...

In the sky.

Three Iron Devourer Beasts flew in formation, each one seemingly cast from the same mold. Su Yu thought that whether Lantian posed as May or Full Moon, it made little difference. Of course, their auras were slightly different. March was the largest, followed by Su Yu.

As they flew, March occasionally glanced at Su Yu and Lantian, surprised at how well they had disguised themselves. Su Yu noticed March's gaze and smiled, "Father, is there something you wish to say?"

March felt a bit awkward with the title, but he had to admit that their disguises were impeccable, down to the smallest details even while traveling. March quickly changed the subject, "Do you two know much about Ren Mountain?"

"We know a little," Su Yu replied.

March nodded slightly, "Let me give you a bit more information. The territories of the God, Demon, and Immortal Races in the Upper Realm surround Ren Mountain. Ren Mountain was originally intended to be the site of the Human Emperor's Palace."

"The origins of Ren Mountain are not simple. It wasn't there initially. It was moved from the depths of Chaos Mountain by the Culture King and several rulers of laws when the humans were opening up the Upper Realm."

"To secure this mountain, it's said that even ancient beasts at the ruler of laws level were slain."

...

March continued to explain the situation of Ren Mountain. Su Yu listened silently for a while before asking, "None of the three major races have occupied Ren Mountain?"

He added, "Is there something special about Ren Mountain?"

March nodded, "Of course, there's something special. Ren Mountain was moved by human experts to become the core of the Upper Realm! Moreover, it is a divine mountain from the era of creation, rich in the power of chaos and myriad paths. It's an excellent holy land for cultivation!"

Su Yu listened quietly. If it's a holy land, why haven't the three major races occupied it? Why?

He believed March must know something. As expected, March continued, "The reason the three major races haven't occupied Ren Mountain is manifold. First, all three races want it, making it difficult to settle without conflict. It's not worth starting a war over a single mountain."

"Second, while Ren Mountain is a great cultivation site, it has a unique trait that affects those who stay there, which is the main reason the three races abandoned it."

Su Yu was puzzled, "Affects them how?"

March nodded his large head, "Staying on Ren Mountain for too long creates a drawback. It makes one feel a closer affinity and responsibility towards humans. Initially, the three races did send some experts to cultivate there, but after a while, these individuals felt guilty when fighting humans. The longer they stayed, the more they felt responsible for the humans!"

...

Su Yu was speechless. After a moment, he understood the probable reason. The Human Emperor must have done something on Ren Mountain. Was this the Human Emperor's path of responsibility?

Ren Mountain was originally designed for the ancient human elites. Naturally, it was meant to instill a sense of responsibility in them, essentially a subtle form of indoctrination. Over time, the high-ranking human experts would develop a strong sense of mission.

The Human Emperor... was quite cunning. No wonder such a treasure was abandoned by the three major races, only used for hosting the Myriad Race Conference.

Su Yu chuckled, "Then why hold the Myriad Race Conference there?"

"It's fine for short periods," March explained. "Holding the conference at Ren Mountain allows us to use the power of the myriad races to dispel some of its influence, preventing it from spreading, especially since the territories of the three major races are nearby."

Su Yu nodded.

"Moreover, Ren Mountain is at the core of the Upper Realm, making it convenient for all races to gather there."

March continued, "When we go there, the Human Lord should avoid using the Heaven Gate to spy. Those at the level of Heavenly Sovereigns can sense it to some extent."

Su Yu nodded, "I know. I was discovered last time."

Though he was stronger now, it was still risky. Unless absolutely necessary, Su Yu wouldn't recklessly open the Heaven Gate.

As they walked and talked, they were nearing Ren Mountain. Traveling from Bamboo Mountain to Ren Mountain meant passing through several major race territories. Near Ren Mountain, they entered the Demon Race's territory.

To reach Ren Mountain, they had to pass through the Demon Race's domain. Before they arrived, Su Yu sensed the pervasive demonic aura. From above, he saw massive Demon Race cities stretching across the land.

Su Yu transmitted a message, "Senior March, is there no neutral ground between the God, Demon, and Immortal Races?"

Passing directly through the Demon Race's territory wasn't something just anyone dared to do.

"There isn't," March replied directly. "The three races have encircled Ren Mountain. Initially, there were gaps, but as more experts and dojos appeared, those gaps were occupied, and the territories of the three races began to border each other."

As they spoke, they approached a massive city. March and the others did not conceal their auras. As they reached the city's airspace, a figure appeared, exuding overwhelming demonic energy.

A Daofuse Realm expert!

And not just this one; soon, several Eternal Realm experts also rose into the air. The Demon Race expert glanced at them, recognizing March and the others. With a peculiar expression, he quickly smiled, "So it's our friends from the Iron Devourer Race! I thought you wouldn't attend this Myriad Race Conference!"

He continued, "Heavenly Sovereign March, please wait a moment while I notify our Demon Race elder, Demon Heaven, to come and greet you!"

March lazily replied, "No need, I'll go myself!"

"Heavenly Sovereign, please wait a moment. Otherwise, those below might not recognize your status and offend you!"

March glanced at him, seeing he had no intention of making way. He looked at the distant cities, sensing the presence of Daofuse auras, and shrugged, "Do as you please. Have those old fellows like Destiny arrived?"

The Demon Race Daofuse expert smiled, "I'm not sure. If they didn't pass through our Demon Race territory, I wouldn't know. They might have gone through the territories of the Immortal or God Races."

March didn't ask further, nor did he pay attention to the expert. The level was too low for him to bother with. In the Myriad Realms, Daofuse was top-tier, but to March, only those at the Heavenly Sovereign level were on his level. If not for the timing, these individuals could become rulers of laws.

Su Yu remained silent, letting March take the lead. At this moment, Su Yu was quietly observing, assessing the number of Demon Race experts and the number of large cities. In his mind, he was already planning how to quickly break through the Demon Race's blockade if they had to retreat from Ren Mountain.

How could they escape the fastest? What Daofuse experts would they encounter?

As he observed, the void tore open, and a powerful Demon Race expert emerged, his body slightly hunched, his voice carrying a sinister laugh, "Brother March, I thought you weren't coming!"

March looked at him, his massive body much more robust than the other's. March glanced at him and lazily said, "If I didn't come, would you have come to invite me, Demon Heaven?"

"You're joking, my friend!"

Demon Heaven laughed, then glanced at Su Yu and Lantian without much interest, "Isn't Giant Bamboo coming?"

"Guarding the house!"

March yawned, "Someone has to stay behind, or some bastards might target Bamboo Mountain while I'm away."

Demon Heaven chuckled, not pursuing the topic further. Since March had come, it was a good thing.

Soon, Demon Heaven said, "Brother March, let me escort you to Ren Mountain. Most of the other races have arrived, only a few are still missing."

March didn't refuse, stepping closer to Demon Heaven. Su Yu and Lantian quickly followed. March walked alongside Demon Heaven, asking, "You fought Hundred Battle last time. How was it?"

"Quite formidable!"

Demon Heaven laughed sinisterly, "Even without fully unsealing, he could rival a Heavenly Sovereign! If fully unsealed, it might take two or three Heavenly Sovereigns to contend with him! I must say, Hundred Battle is indeed exceptionally talented! In ancient times, given a few more years, he might have been crowned a Human King!"

He continued with a ghostly laugh, "Brother March, you also emerged that day. Why did you return?"

March chuckled, "Seeing so many of you against one, I figured capturing Hundred Battle was a sure thing, so I didn't intervene!"

"Oh, I thought you were going to rescue Hundred Battle."

"Not familiar."

March casually replied, "During the Ninth Tide, our race didn't intervene. June wanted to, even sent July to assist... but July died, and our race lost interest."

Demon Heaven laughed. This wasn't a secret. During the Ninth Tide, the Iron Devourer Race seemed eager to participate, but after July's death, they quickly withdrew.

"A good thing!"

Demon Heaven laughed sinisterly, "Had you participated, perhaps... things wouldn't be as they are now!"

March didn't respond. As they crossed the vast cities, Demon Heaven occasionally glanced at Su Yu and Lantian. After a while, in the distance, a massive mountain's silhouette became visible.

After flying for a while, Demon Heaven suddenly said, "Friend April, I've heard that the Iron Devourer Race in the lower realm might have some ties with the humans. Brother March doesn't concern himself with mundane affairs, but are you aware of this?"

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "Well... our race really doesn't know. We haven't approached the passage between the lower and upper realms, and not many Eternals have died in the lower realm, so we haven't noticed anything."

Mo Tian nodded slightly. "I heard from below, but the specifics are unclear until the Lower Realm opens. However, your clan in the Lower Realm should be under June's control. June wouldn't be foolish enough to get involved with the Human Race, right?"

Su Yu chuckled. "Well... let's discuss it once the Lower Realm opens. If June makes a mistake, we'll punish him!"

"The Human Race has no hope!" Mo Tian continued nonchalantly, "The strongest among the Human Race now is Hundred Battle. Even at his peak, leading over a hundred Daofuse Realm experts, he was still defeated! Now, Hundred Battle is no longer at his peak, and the Human Race's Daofuse Realm experts have nearly all fallen. Over the past six thousand years, the strength of various races has grown significantly... incomparable to the past!"

Su Yu and the others remained silent.

At that moment, an overwhelming aura spread across the area. A colossal mountain appeared before them, leaving Su Yu in awe. He had thought Ren Mountain was just a massive mountain, but seeing it now, it was truly towering!

It was immensely tall!

At a glance, it seemed to exceed a height of 100,000 meters, and it was incredibly vast, exuding a powerful aura.

Currently, there were many people at the foot of Ren Mountain. March glanced down, and Mo Tian sneered, "These are the strong ones brought by various races. The Chaos Race's indiscriminate killing has made some smaller races worry about being ambushed if their Daofuse Realm experts leave, so they've brought their families along."

There were many people at the mountain's base, but almost all were below the Daofuse Realm. Most Daofuse Realm experts had already ascended the mountain.

At the mountain's peak stood a gigantic palace, initially intended to be the Human Emperor's Palace. However, due to an ancient upheaval, it was left unfinished. Over the years, the three major races made some repairs and used it for the Myriad Races Conference.

"We just need to head up the mountain!" Mo Tian laughed. "Most of the races have arrived. By tomorrow, those who haven't arrived probably won't come!"

As for those who wouldn't come, judging by Mo Tian's tone, their fate wouldn't be pleasant.

...

The closer they got to Ren Mountain, the more they could feel its immense power. The power of laws was thick, not from the River of Time, but from Ren Mountain itself. The mountain was inherently powerful.

March and Su Yu remained silent, flying silently towards the mountain's peak. From other directions, strong figures arrived, accompanied by experts from the Immortal and God Races. The Demon Race also had other race experts arriving, accompanied by Demon Race experts.

As they flew, a palace appeared before them. Before Su Yu and the others arrived, laughter echoed, "March Daoist, you finally arrived, esteemed guest!"

March's expression turned slightly serious, but he quickly smiled lazily, "Moon Heavenly Venerable, you're too kind!"

Moon Heavenly Venerable!

Su Yu knew that March had mentioned before that Moon Heavenly Venerable was from the God Race. Mo Tian and Mo Heavenly Venerable were from the Demon Race, Ming Heavenly Venerable was a strong figure from the Nether Race, Dao Heavenly Venerable and Desolate Heavenly Venerable were from the Immortal Race, and Moon Heavenly Venerable was from the God Race.

The Demon and Immortal Races each had two Heavenly Venerable experts. As for the God Race, it seemed they only had one, but March had told Su Yu there were likely more. The God Race had been quite low-key over the years, but their foundation was deep.

Not to mention, the God Race's God Emperor's Consort in the Lower Realm was the God Emperor's partner, a true ancient figure with a high status. The God Emperor's Consort was still alive, and the God Race's foundation might be deeper than that of the Immortals and Demons.

Su Yu didn't respond, remaining vigilant. These Heavenly Venerables were not weak, and he had to be careful not to reveal anything.

...

Soon, the group entered the enormous hall. The interior of the hall was circular, a unique structure. From any direction, the core position in one's view was the central five areas of the hall.

March transmitted a message, "This was built by the Human Race back then. The five positions you see represent the Human Emperor and the Four Extremes Human Kings of that time! They represent the core of the entire Human Race, centered on these five figures!"

"During meetings here, everyone's focus will be on these five positions. So, as we enter, these five positions are the main focus."

It forced one to focus on these five positions.

At this moment, three of the five positions were already occupied by the Demon, Immortal, and God Races.

Mo Tian, who had brought March and the others in, smiled and flew directly to the Demon Race's area. There, a purple-haired expert sat cross-legged with eyes closed, seemingly oblivious to their presence.

However, the seemingly frail Moon Heavenly Venerable from the God Race smiled and said, "March Daoist, come sit here."

He pointed to an area next to the God Race, also one of the five major areas.

Before March could respond, numerous gazes focused on him, almost all from Daofuse Realm experts, with faint traces of Heavenly King-level auras.

March glanced around and chuckled foolishly, "No need, the Fate Clan's old ghost hasn't arrived yet. Destiny Marquis is more suitable!"

He continued, "The Dragon and Phoenix are also more suitable. If not, the Ancient Giant Race would be good too!"

He thought of something and laughed heartily, "Right, where's Thunderstorm from the Ancient Giant Race?"

The Ancient Giant Race!

Upon hearing this, Mo Heavenly Venerable glanced at him and said indifferently, "Thunderstorm might not come out this time. Even when Hundred Battle was unsealed, Thunderstorm didn't show up. Perhaps he hasn't awakened yet. But March Daoist, you seem energetic, maintaining your combat power without needing sleep."

March cursed inwardly but quickly laughed, "Seems like several of you have issues with me... Fine, April, you host this meeting. Handle the Iron Devourer Race's matters. I'll just listen!"

Su Yu, hearing this, glanced at the experts and silently flew towards one of the five areas.

Mo Heavenly Venerable and the others remained indifferent, but a faint smile appeared in their eyes.

March, unsure of what to think, didn't refuse and followed along.

Once they settled, they stopped speaking.

To the left was the God Race's area, and to the right was the only vacant area. The five major areas formed a ring, the center and core of the entire hall.

The hall fell silent once more.

The various races remained quiet.

Su Yu even noticed strong figures from the Dragon Race. After Blood Dragon Marquis was killed, the Dragon Race still had strong figures. Those from the Source of the Dao led them, possessing Heavenly King-level strength, indicating the Dragon Race wasn't weak.

They had more than one Daofuse Realm expert.

However, the Dragon Race seemed to lack Heavenly Venerable-level experts.

Not as strong as the Nether Race!

The silence lasted for a moment before two giants of similar size entered the hall.

"Thunderstorm!"

Mo Heavenly Venerable and the others opened their eyes again. Beside Thunderstorm was Desolate Heavenly Venerable from the Immortal Race.

Thunderstorm, a top expert of the Ancient Giant Race, was an extremely ancient existence with top-tier strength, faintly exuding a Heavenly Venerable aura.

The Ancient Giant Race had a long heritage, once a dominant force in ancient times.

However, they had been quiet in recent years.

The Myriad Races were unsure of the Ancient Giant Race's stance.

However, it was rumored that the Ancient Giant Race had some ties with Hundred Battle of the Human Race. The Myriad Races were unaware of the specifics, and only a few knew about Hundred Battle's descendants within the Ancient Giant Race.

At this moment, Mo Heavenly Venerable spoke again, "Thunderstorm Daoist, there's still one position left. Ming Heavenly Venerable hasn't arrived... Why not take a seat?"

The Ancient Giant, exuding a powerful aura with eyes like thunder, was bare-chested with a beast-skin-like garment below.

Upon hearing this, he scanned the area and thundered, "Forget it, leave it for Ming Daoist!"

He glanced at the Iron Devourer Race's side, somewhat surprised.

The Iron Devourer Race's March had actually gone over to sit. Sitting there might not be a good thing and could come with a price.

Ignoring the others, he walked to an empty area, followed by several smaller giants, all Daofuse Realm experts, sitting in the second layer of the circular area.

...

"April, this position isn't easy to sit in!"

At this moment, March transmitted to Su Yu, "That was Thunderstorm, a top expert of the Ancient Giant Race, with strength comparable to mine. This guy didn't come, yet we're sitting here..."

Su Yu transmitted back, "The five areas represent five cores, the leaders of this meeting. Since we're here, let's sit."

March had nothing more to say.

At this moment, people continued to arrive.

Besides the major strong races, other smaller races had their own areas. They participated in the first meeting and knew where they belonged.

The innermost layer had only five families.

The second layer had over ten areas.

Dragon, Phoenix, Ancient Giant, Ape, Golden-winged Roc, Kunpeng, Spirit Race...

These strong races from the Lower Realm also had a place here.

As for the Ancient Hou Race, their strength in the Upper Realm wasn't strong. Su Yu didn't see them in the second layer, not even in the third layer. However, the Space Ancient Beast Race was in the third layer, a massive Space Ancient Beast lying silently.

Su Yu vaguely understood!

The first layer represented those with Heavenly Venerable-level experts.

The second layer had Heavenly Kings.

The third layer had top-tier Daofuse Realm experts.

As for those behind, they all had Daofuse Realm experts.

This indicated that over ten strong races had Heavenly King-level existences.

The third tier had about thirty to forty positions. Did that mean there were thirty to forty top-tier Daofuse families among the great clans? Although they were called the myriad races, there were actually only about three to four hundred races in the Upper Realm now. Of those, perhaps only a hundred or so came to attend the meeting. Without a Daofuse expert, they might not even bother coming, and even if they did, they might not have a place. Many races had long since vanished from the Upper Realm over time, though they still had legacies in the Lower Realm. Some newly emerged small races had no presence in the Upper Realm. Even races like the Five Elemental Race, which were not weak in the Lower Realm, had no powerful presence in the Upper Realm.

Su Yu quietly observed everything.

...

After waiting for about an hour or two, several more auras arrived. Soon, the cheerful voice of Heavendoom rang out, "Brother Destiny, let's continue our chat later when we have more time."

With Heavendoom's laughter echoing, two figures appeared before everyone. One was Heavendoom, and the other was Destiny Marquis. Destiny Marquis appeared to be a kindly old man, contrasting sharply with the somewhat deathly aura of Heavendoom beside him. As soon as they entered, without waiting for others to speak, Destiny Marquis smiled and said, "Everyone's here. I apologize for my tardiness."

With that, he directly took a seat in the area next to the Ancient Giant Race. He glanced at the last available spot but didn't linger, giving no chance for others to speak.

Heavendoom, on the other hand, glanced at a few people, including Mo Tianzun, and seeing that they had no objections, smiled and settled in the empty area near Su Yu and his group.

At this moment, all five areas in the innermost circle were occupied: the God, Demon, Immortal, Iron Devourer, and Nether Races. The Iron Devourer Race seemed somewhat out of place among them. In terms of strength, the Iron Devourer Race might not even be stronger than the Fate and Ancient Giant Races, yet those two races were unwilling to sit in the inner circle.

...

At this point, on the Immortal side, the white-haired elder who had spoken earlier opened his eyes, glanced around, and said indifferently, "Almost everyone is here. Those who haven't come need not bother!"

Those who needed to be here were already present.

"This is the Myriad Races Council, convened for the second time this month!"

"Last time, we couldn't reach a consensus on some issues. This time, we must set the tone and reach an agreement! If we can't, we'll keep meeting until we do!"

With that, he said calmly, "Origin Saint, you will preside over the meeting."

Origin Saint Marquis, a top-tier expert of the Immortal Race, a Heavenly King-level existence, smiled and stepped forward from behind the elder, walking to the center. "This Myriad Races Council will be presided over by me!"

"Today, compared to last time, we have even more experts!"

"This meeting has only one core issue: the Chaos Race!"

Origin Saint Marquis's voice was grand, "The Chaos Race has appeared three times this year. The first time, they rescued Marquis Dingjun and killed two Daofuse experts of the Demon Race!"

"The second time, they ambushed the Dragon Race, killing six Daofuse experts and a million dragons!"

"The third time, they broke into the Source of the Dao, unsealed Hundred Battle, killed eight quasi-kings, two Daofuse experts, and lost three quasi-kings and several Daofuse experts themselves!"

He didn't hide the losses but instead stated them directly. His voice grew solemn, "This race, as many of you know, betrayed Hundred Battle at the end of the Ninth Tide, sealing him, which led to the victory of the myriad races!"

"Over four thousand years ago, a powerful being from this race attempted to unseal Hundred Battle in the Source of the Dao but was repelled. That was also someone from the Chaos Race!"

He looked around and asked, "Does anyone have any questions?"

Someone softly asked, "There are some. The Chaos Race first betrayed Hundred Battle and sealed him. Why do they want to unseal him now?"

Origin Saint Marquis had been waiting for this question and smiled, "Because back then, they feared! They feared Hundred Battle would defeat us and unify the Myriad Realms! If the chaos ended and the great war ceased, the Chaos Race would have no more opportunities!"

"Later, when Hundred Battle was defeated and the Human Race's foundation was exhausted, they unsealed Hundred Battle to continue opposing us and deplete our strength!"

Origin Saint Marquis smiled, "If you still don't understand, let me put it plainly. Six thousand years ago, they felt they couldn't match the myriad races and the Human Race. Six thousand years later, they might feel confident!"

At these words, the only Heavenly King-level expert of the Dragon Race, somewhat agitated, said, "Origin Saint, is this all the information we have on the Chaos Race? What about their specific strength? Everything is just speculation!"

Origin Saint Marquis nodded, "Therefore, the urgent task is to first reach a consensus and form an alliance! Then, gather the strength of the myriad races to sweep through Chaos Mountain, investigate this race's power, and prevent them from picking us off one by one!"

Origin Saint Marquis said solemnly, "The myriad races couldn't defeat the Human Race before, but by joining forces, they could match them! That's how the ancient co-governance of the Myriad Realms came to be! If we were divided, the ancient races would have been defeated by the Human Race one by one! Now, the situation is the same. The purpose of the Myriad Races Council is to form an alliance again!"

The Dragon Race's Heavenly King spoke again, "An alliance is an old rule. We have no major objections! The Chaos Race's attack on our race, killing Blood Dragon Marquis and other experts, is a heinous crime. Today they can destroy the Dragon Race; tomorrow, they can destroy other races! Chaos Mountain is dangerous. Without joining forces, we all have concerns. Our Dragon Race now has only me at the quasi-king level, with three Daofuse experts in the clan. This time, our Dragon Race will go all out. I will lead the three Daofuse experts to join the alliance!"

...

A shill!

Su Yu instantly guessed it. Damn it, just a shill.

It was obvious!

Moreover, the myriad races probably all knew the Dragon Race was acting as a shill.

Origin Saint Marquis also smiled, "Marquis Longju is wise. If everyone were like the Dragon Race, we wouldn't even need to hold this second Myriad Races Council. We would have already marched on Chaos Mountain!"

"The biggest challenge of this meeting, the biggest issue, is how many troops each race will send!"

Origin Saint Marquis smiled, "In fact, dealing with Chaos Mountain is something that must be done! There's almost nothing to discuss! The key is how many troops to send?"

Origin Saint Marquis spoke quickly, not giving anyone a chance to interrupt, "My suggestion is that this time, the five major races take the lead! Each race sends one Heavenly Sovereign, and the five Heavenly Sovereigns form a temporary Myriad Races decision-making body! If there is no consensus, the five Heavenly Sovereigns will consult, and if they can't agree, they will vote!"

In an instant, everyone looked at the Iron Devourer Race.

Now, everyone understood why the Iron Devourer Race was seated in the inner circle.

March also changed his expression slightly.

Origin Saint Marquis continued, "The five major races, in addition to sending a Heavenly Sovereign to form the decision-making body, will also send a quasi-king to lead the army to Chaos Mountain..."

Goodness, Su Yu secretly thought, even Marquis Giant Bamboo has to participate!

That's quite something!

"And the Dragon and Phoenix races, each must send a quasi-king expert..."

The second-tier races must send a Heavenly King and at least three Daofuse experts.

The third-tier, top-tier Daofuse experts must participate.

Beyond the third tier, each race only needs to send one Daofuse expert.

Depending on the seating position, the strength of the participants varies.

In this way, there would be at least five Heavenly Sovereigns, over fifteen Heavenly Kings, and nearly a hundred Daofuse experts!

Such strength was incredibly formidable.

They could face the Ninth Tide's Human Race head-on and even have a good chance of winning!

This meeting was essentially the three major races and other races reaching a consensus, but now they were asking the Iron Devourer, Fate, and other races to contribute.

Not only that, but Mo Tianzun also smiled and said, "I see that Thunderstorm and Destiny friends are here as well. To be safe, it would be best if you two could join us and form a seven-member decision-making body! It would also help us understand everything about Chaos Mountain in a timely manner."

He looked at the two, meaningfully saying, "If you two are unwilling, it's fine. Just send a quasi-king from your race."

If a quasi-king came... they might not return alive!

As for March, he had to participate!

These two, whether they participated or not, were not forced.

March frowned slightly and said, "According to what you're saying, not only do I have to participate, but Giant Bamboo also has to come, and we have to send five Daofuse experts. I'm afraid our race can't gather five Daofuse experts!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign smiled, "Then let April, May, and Full Moon participate."

Damn you!

March wanted to curse. So, my entire race's Daofuse experts have to participate?

Mo Tianzun interrupted, "No, Moon Heavenly Sovereign, we can't leave no defensive forces. Full Moon can stay behind at Bamboo Mountain to give March some peace of mind!"

He smiled faintly, leaving one for you!

March said solemnly, "What if I don't want to go?"

The Immortal Race's Desolate Heavenly Sovereign said coldly, "Why wouldn't you want to? Chaos Mountain has slaughtered countless innocents, disrupted the peace of the Myriad Realms. Does the Iron Devourer Race only want to enjoy the fruits without contributing? Or... is there some connection between the Iron Devourer Race and the Chaos Race?"

Several experts glared fiercely!

Today, they were determined to make the Iron Devourer Race contribute!

March took a deep breath, "So, I have to go?"

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign said coldly, "Of course! March, the battle of the Heavenly Sovereigns won't break out easily. Initially, we just need to sit and watch. Giant Bamboo Marquis will lead your race in the battle..."

March looked at them, then at Destiny and Thunderstorm, and chuckled foolishly, "Weren't we supposed to discuss this? Why does it feel like it has to be this way?"

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign said indifferently, "The discussion is almost over. Does March have any different opinions?"

March now fully understood.

What discussion? What first meeting didn't reach a consensus? It was just targeting the strong races that didn't come the first time, leading to this second meeting.

And Su Yu quickly assessed the number of experts participating in this battle.

It was still somewhat shocking. The myriad races, without even understanding the full strength of Chaos Mountain, were willing to send so many experts. They were taking it very seriously!

Chaos Mountain, where the weak are instantly obliterated!

March took a deep breath, seemingly reluctant to speak further. "April, you decide!"

Several Heavenly Sovereigns turned their gazes toward April, some smiling, others with stern expressions.

Su Yu chuckled awkwardly, saying, "The Iron Devourer Race certainly won't oppose, but... our numbers are too few. It's not suitable for us to act early. Let me handle the task of clearing the ancient beasts on the outskirts of Chaos Mountain. As for Marquis Giant Bamboo, let's wait until the quasi-kings make their move."

It was clear that the myriad races intended for Marquis Giant Bamboo to be the vanguard. Su Yu was concerned about potential complications.

After a brief consideration, the others nodded slightly. Whether April or Marquis Giant Bamboo took action made little difference, as April was March's son.

The Heavenly Sovereigns nodded slightly. As long as you agree!

If you don't agree, since March is here, he might not be able to leave.

Seeing that Destiny Marquis and the others remained silent, Origin Saint Marquis smiled and quickly said, "Then let the strong of each race quickly gather at Ren Mountain. There's no need to head directly to Chaos Mountain to avoid being ambushed!"

Gather everyone first. Once March and his people are here, they won't be leaving!

"Within three days, the strong of each race will gather and march on Chaos Mountain!"

"Under the Daofuse Realm, each race will send ten thousand troops to clear the ancient beasts below the Daofuse Realm on the outskirts of Chaos Mountain and scout the terrain..."

Origin Saint Marquis swiftly arranged the plan.

Soon, he smiled again, "The Heavenly Sovereigns are busy. For this temporary decision-making meeting, I'll host on behalf of the Immortal Race. Other races can each select a representative."

He looked at Su Yu and smiled, "April, will you represent your race, or should we wait for Marquis Giant Bamboo?"

Su Yu chuckled, "I'll do it!"

Everyone laughed. This time, the Iron Devourer Race was very cooperative! A good thing! However, they still needed to keep a close watch to prevent any mishaps.

P.S.: Still feeling a bit unwell, but much better. I'll try not to delay updates.
