Chapter 726: The Great Dao Painting (Please Subscribe)

The sound of heavy breathing echoed.

Su Yu burst out of the River of Time, gasping for air. Without Little Stone, he might not have had the chance to break through. Of course, without Little Stone, perhaps there wouldn't have been a journey to the Upper Realm at all.

After catching his breath, Su Yu looked up, his eyes flickering with realization. The place he emerged from seemed to be directly above him, meaning the exit was right overhead.

Surveying his surroundings, Su Yu found himself in what appeared to be a cultivation chamber. Could it belong to the Human Emperor?

His heart stirred slightly, and suddenly, the Mark of Civilization flickered, releasing several people. Though he didn't recognize them, he believed someone would.

Indeed, as soon as the Great Zhou King and the others appeared, the Great Zhou King paused, glanced around, and after a moment, softly said, "We... seem to be... in the Human Emperor's Palace?"

The others turned to look at him, including several ancient marquises. They were not particularly familiar with the Human Emperor. Among the ancient human race, there were 36 Kings and 4 Extreme Kings, along with 360 ancient marquises, but their encounters with the Human Emperor were rare. The Human Emperor's Palace was not a place one could visit casually.

Was this really the Human Emperor's Palace? Had they arrived at the Luminous Domain Mansion?

Everyone felt a bit dazed. Had they suddenly returned to the Lower Realm from the Upper Realm?

The Great Zhou King didn't speak further. He looked around for a while before saying, "It just feels somewhat similar, though it might not be. However, the arrangement and layout resemble His Majesty's style."

It was a rather spacious room. Su Yu couldn't discern any unique style; the room was arranged quite simply. In sight was a large bookshelf, and beside it, a weapon rack. Was it a symbol of wielding both the pen and the sword?

In one corner of the room was a tea table with two chairs. If this was indeed the Human Emperor's cultivation place, it suggested that the Human Emperor might have received guests here.

The area where Su Yu and the others stood was quite open, with only a single meditation mat, possibly where the Human Emperor usually cultivated.

Su Yu glanced around and then looked at the Great Zhou King, asking in a low voice, "Have you ever been to the Human Emperor's cultivation place?"

"No," the Great Zhou King shook his head. "A cultivation place is a very private matter, and besides, I'm not responsible for such things. But judging by the furnishings and the fact that we emerged from the Time Passage... it's likely His Majesty's cultivation chamber."

He too looked around, a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. This place should be the Human Emperor's cultivation ground. In the blink of an eye, countless years had passed. When would His Majesty return?

The Great Zhou King was not loyal to the Hundred Battle King. He, the Weapon Cave, Dan Yu, and the Torchbearers all inherited the Human Emperor's flame, the flame of the human race! They were the Human Emperor's subordinates! They were the most loyal guards of the Human Emperor! They remained in the Myriad Realms to pass on the ancient legacy, to carry forward the Human Emperor's will.

And now, suddenly arriving here, suddenly entering the Human Emperor's Palace, the Great Zhou King felt a complex mix of emotions. I... have returned!

A separation of a hundred thousand years! After the fall of the ancient era, no one had ever reached the ninth level again, no one could.

"The Human Emperor's Palace!"

At this moment, Lantian transformed into a little girl, looking around with a giggle, "It seems like everything here is a treasure, but... why does it feel like there's not even a divine weapon? Was the Human Emperor poor?"

In the room, some furnishings and furniture, long influenced by the Human Emperor, were rich in Dao essence, clearly treasures at a glance. However, they seemed to be nurtured by daily Dao essence rather than being supreme treasures themselves.

The Great Zhou King softly said, "At His Majesty's level, what use are treasures or divine weapons? Only the things used daily, those he liked, mattered."

Indeed! Lantian nodded slightly. They were far from reaching the Human Emperor's realm, so far that it was utterly unattainable.

At this time, Huoyun Marquis and the others were quite restrained. They dared not look around or touch anything. This was the Human Emperor's abode! In their hearts, this was a holy land! A true holy land! Whether it was Su Yu or the Hundred Battle King, no matter how dazzling Su Yu's performance was, at this moment, compared to the Human Emperor, it was like comparing the sun and the moon!

The Human Emperor was the supreme being who truly unified the Myriad Realms! He suppressed the Myriad Realms for tens of thousands of years, creating the only empire since the dawn of time, which still had countless powerful beings originating from that era, from the Human Emperor's era!

This was an existence that, even after disappearing for hundreds of thousands of years, still commanded reverence.

These ancient marquises could flaunt their seniority before the Hundred Battle King, flaunt their experience before Su Yu. However, before the Human Emperor, they were merely elite soldiers of that era.

The Human Emperor was the core of that era, the Four Kings were the chief ministers, the 36 Human Kings were the pillars, and the 360 marquises were merely generals, far removed from the Human Emperor.

Especially generals like General Yingwu, who had almost no chance to meet the Human Emperor alone in that era.

Now, the few remaining ancient marquises were not the top-tier marquises of that era. The truly top-tier marquises had almost all perished. They died in one upheaval after another, as top-tier existences were the focus of attention, the targets of encirclement. Those who remained were initially minor figures.

At this moment, even though the Human Emperor had been gone for countless years, even though Yingwu liked to curse the Hundred Battle King, here, he was very well-behaved. The few ancient powerhouses all slightly bowed, showing their respect.

They had actually arrived at the Human Emperor's Palace!

Su Yu said nothing. He rested briefly, calming his breath, and only then did he have the time to carefully observe his surroundings.

Originally, he had his back to the rear wall, facing the front door. He could see the bookshelf, the weapon rack, and the table and chairs to one side. Everything seemed ordinary, nothing extraordinary.

Even Su Yu could produce such items; the furnishings in the Culture King's Residence were no less than those here in the Human Emperor's place.

It seemed there was nothing special here.

But suddenly, Su Yu felt something. He turned his head and was momentarily stunned.

On the wall behind him hung a massive painting.

It wasn't a self-portrait of the Human Emperor, nor a landscape painting. It was a black-and-white ink painting, abstract at first glance! Oppressive at second glance!

The black seemed like dark clouds covering the sky, the white like the eventual dawn, black and white alternating, with hints of other things within.

Su Yu looked at it, completely captivated.

At this moment, everything else in the room faded from his view. His eyes were fixed solely on this painting.

Others were observing Su Yu and, seeing him suddenly turn to look at the painting, they too turned their attention to it.

At this moment, everyone was looking.

Yet it seemed that each person saw something different.

The Great Ming King looked and saw a scene of a storm, the sky black, the earth gray, torrential rain pouring down, with signs of heaven and earth collapsing. He vaguely saw a person.

That person stood amidst the storm, gazing at the heavens with a resolute expression, suddenly waving a hand, scattering formation bases across the world.

Soon, a grand formation was outlined.

As the heavens crumbled, a grand formation emerged, stabilizing the world.

The Great Ming King's eyes were dazed, filled with astonishment.

A formation! What... what was this?

Someone had laid down a world-shaking formation, stabilizing the world as the heavens shattered?

Meanwhile, others saw different things.

Grandstar also looked.

He too saw a black sky and black water.

In that water, countless ancient beasts were struggling to cross.

At this moment, a massive fish-headed monster swam in the black water, devouring everything, suddenly spewing a long sword from its mouth, slaughtering all around.

A struggle to cross! A fish leaping over the dragon gate!

...

Lantian's vision was more intriguing than the others.

He saw chaos!

It was as if he had returned to the time of creation, witnessing an incredibly powerful being tearing through chaos, opening the heavens and the earth. He saw the River of Time, saw myriad paths spreading.

Like a great tree, gradually growing branches.

The myriad races stood tall!

At that time, the Myriad Realms seemed to be a chaotic land, later opened by countless powerhouses, each opening a small realm, sheltering their respective races, transitioning from the chaotic era to the era of myriad races and realms.

Countless races were opening paths.

In that era, paths had to be opened by oneself.

...

The Great Zhou King saw something different from the others.

In the storm, the world was dark.

An ancient existence walked on the pitch-black earth, staggering, barely clothed.

As he walked, a giant beast floated by, and the barely clothed traveler lay prostrate on the ground, waiting for the beast to pass before rising to continue his journey.

On this dark earth, dangers were countless, crises innumerable.

Every step, every moment, was fraught with peril.

The barely clothed traveler walked resolutely forward, enduring, lurking, waiting.

A faint light gradually bloomed beneath his feet.

Compared to the darkness, it was so weak.

Yet, a single spark can start a prairie fire!

As this traveler crossed mountains and rivers, traversed the earth, survived countless crises, avoided countless powerful enemies, finally, the darkness dissipated, countless points of light converged into one!

Light burst forth!

Dawn broke!

Spreading the seeds of fire in the darkness, waiting in hiding when strength was insufficient, lighting one spark after another, until finally, the light was seen!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King's eyes were filled with the joy of seeing the light!

Along this journey, the traveler endured countless hardships, bowed down, prayed... finally, he saw the light of the world!

A single misstep, and there would be no such brilliant world!

...

Everyone followed Su Yu's gaze, looking at the painting.

Each person saw something different.

And Su Yu, at this moment, was also looking.

What he saw was different from the others.

He too saw darkness.

Boundless darkness!

In this darkness, gradually, a heartbeat seemed to echo.

Chaos knew no time.

Countless years later, suddenly, a soft sound emerged, and in that boundless darkness, the heartbeat suddenly paused, then a shadow appeared.

That shadow's appearance and race were indiscernible, only a pair of clear eyes could be seen.

With a sense of confusion and ignorance, he wandered through the chaos and drifted in the darkness. Time and life were mysteries to him. Then, one day, something inexplicable happened. The shadow suddenly roared.

Abruptly, the chaos was torn apart!

The shadow continued to tear through the chaos, creating heaven and earth. During this process, countless ancient beasts were born, appearing in the darkness.

Still unaware of the passage of time, the shadow seemed to gain some insight. With a grand gesture, a beautiful river gradually emerged between heaven and earth.

A river began to take shape, stretching out little by little.

The shadow observed the myriad races and all things, adding bits and pieces into the river. It extended a thousand meters, ten thousand meters, a hundred thousand meters... reaching towards the ends of heaven and earth!

Time passed unnoticed.

Ages sank into oblivion.

Until one day, the sky was completely divided.

Darkness above and below, light in the middle, a river ran through the chaos.

The shadow disappeared.

Countless ages later, life and death existed between heaven and earth, without reincarnation. Birth, aging, sickness, death, emotions, joy, and sorrow.

On this day, suddenly, a colossal being entered the river.

"Life and death, where there is life, there is death. Life is visible, death dissipates? Who can be immortal?"

"I wish to open the path of death, to control death. Let the myriad races and all things cycle through life and death. Living beings under your control, the dead under mine..."

Boom!

The river surged, waves of deathly aura spread across heaven and earth. Soon, those deathly auras converged, and the gigantic figure continued to open up the world along the river, towards the dark underworld!

Opening the Death Realm!

Opening the Death Path!

At this moment, Su Yu seemed to be following this figure, together opening a path that would shake the ancient and modern world!

The Path of Death!

Countless ages passed, a path of death extended downward, and the Death Realm was born.

And with the opening of the path, the gigantic figure vanished over time.

This time, another person appeared.

Without much prelude, Su Yu saw this person looking up at the sky, speaking softly, "Open my Human Path, shelter my people, I wish to open another heaven!"

"Your Majesty, opening the heavens is perilous..."

"I know, but if my human race is to endure for generations, we must open our heaven, the heaven of the Human Path!"

Boom!

The sky shattered, the scene shifted, and this person opened the heavens again, opening upwards.

Chaos was limitless, the world originally had no heaven.

It was only when someone opened this heaven and earth that the myriad races and things came to be.

One by one, peerless geniuses comprehended the Great Dao, understood the essence of heaven and earth, and attempted to open the heavens, adding another pure land to this chaos.

...

The scene stopped abruptly after this person opened the heavens!

Su Yu's eyes were initially clouded, but soon they cleared.

"Time, Death, Human Emperor..."

Su Yu murmured, as if he had seen some ancient will records, a legacy of will.

Introducing three people who opened the heavens!

And the Human Emperor... was probably the last one.

Since the beginning of heaven and earth, how many have opened the heavens, Su Yu did not know.

But he knew, the Human Emperor was very proud.

Yes, very proud.

Everything he saw seemed to say that in this chaos, only two could stand alongside him: the master of the Time Path and the master of the Death Path. He wished to become the third... but it seemed he failed!

At this moment, Su Yu looked again, and the painting before him seemed to have lost its previous charm, the charm retracted, returning to its original state.

Just an ordinary black-and-white ink painting.

However, when Su Yu turned his head, he saw that everyone else seemed to be immersed in the painting.

At this moment, both the Great Ming King and the Great Zhou King had fluctuations in their Dao aura!

The weakest, Grandstar, had sword qi emanating from his body.

The Great Ming King also exuded a vague array Dao aura.

Everyone had their own gains.

Su Yu looked at the painting again, exhaling lightly, what a skill, what a capability!

This is a Dao Diagram!

This is probably written by the Human Emperor himself, his own insights, his own Dao concepts, all infused within.

In this room, this item is the most precious!

As for other things, like tables, chairs, books, weapons, none are one ten-thousandth as precious as this.

"A Dao Diagram, or perhaps an Opening Heaven Diagram!"

At this moment, Su Yu's mind was filled with waves of insights, opening the heavens was not a simple matter.

He wished to open an independent path, perhaps more difficult than imagined.

Even the Human Emperor ultimately failed to open it successfully.

Whether it was a sudden change that caused his failure, or he simply couldn't continue, that was unknown.

...

No one knew how much time passed.

In the room, everyone's aura gradually stabilized.

One by one, the strong opened their eyes.

A long sigh of relief echoed in the room.

"I seem to have... advanced?"

At this moment, Grandstar was the first to speak, with some shock, "What a Fish Leaping Star Sea Diagram!"

Everyone looked at him, are you blind?

What Fish Leaping Star Sea Diagram!

General Yingwu said irritably, "It's clearly a Thousand Transformations Dao Diagram!"

Grandstar was stunned.

The Great Ming King softly said, "Wrong, it's the Foundation of Array Dao!"

"What nonsense, this is clearly the Flame Extinguishing World Diagram!"

"......"

The strong spoke one after another.

Gradually, they all seemed to have some understanding.

What we saw might not be the same.

And Lantian, smiling mischievously, said, "You're all wrong, this is the Diagram of All Beings! All beings encompass all paths, what I saw should be the most complete! I saw Grandstar turning into a fish, eating small fish! I saw the Great Ming King setting up an array, the formation was mediocre... I saw the Great Zhou King being beaten to the ground, begging for mercy, shouting 'I endure'!"

The Great Zhou King had a dark face!

Damn you!

You're a master at making up stories.

Everyone actually knew, what they saw was different, perhaps, that was the power of this diagram, it seemed to be a Dao Diagram!

What you see might be related to your own Great Dao.

General Yingwu was curious, looking at Su Yu, "What did the Human Lord see?"

Su Yu did not turn back, continuing to look at the black-and-white diagram, after a long time, he chuckled, "I saw three people, or rather three beings, and I... want to become the fourth, or the true third!"

The few were slightly stunned.

What does that mean?

The Great Zhou King pondered, softly asking, "Did Emperor Yu see the Human Emperor?"

"Yes."

Su Yu chuckled, turned to look at everyone, nodded slightly, and sighed, "It seems everyone has gained something, Grandstar, you and the Great Ming King, perhaps in a few days, will be third-class Daofuse!"

Grandstar smiled, nodding, "Next time I see Heavendoom, I'll beat the crap out of him!"

Heavendoom, previously only had the strength of fifth-class Daofuse.

Maybe slightly stronger than Grandstar.

And Grandstar, previously absorbed a lot of power of laws, absorbing power of laws actually had limited improvement, Dao insights were fundamental.

Today, he saw many things in this diagram, gained many insights.

Given some time, he might quickly step into the realm of third-class Daofuse.

Third-class Daofuse, was the realm many ancient marquises still maintained.

Second-class Daofuse, those were top-tier existences.

Heavenly Kings were not something any path could achieve.

And so-called Heavenly Sovereigns were the pinnacle of Heavenly Kings.

General Yingwu was also beaming, "I feel, if I follow the Human Lord's standards, in a few days, I might also hope to step into the realm of second-class Daofuse!"

Everyone had gained a lot!

At this moment, they all looked at the diagram, Lantian chuckled, "This diagram, a treasure! Take it back for everyone to see, I think, surely everyone will gain something, we who are below the masters of rules have not reached the limit of Dao insights... it's just, it seems you can only see it once."

Su Yu shook his head, "It's not that you can only see it once, it's just that you need to have your own insights to gain new things. If you don't have insights, depleting your foundation, how can you gain new insights?"

He looked at the diagram, softly saying, "This diagram, to have remained here for so long, since the Human Emperor passed the torch, why didn't he pass this item down?"

Everything here is not as precious as this diagram!

Su Yu felt that he hadn't fully comprehended this diagram, only had some insights.

This thing, a treasure!

"Great Zhou King, did you know about the existence of this diagram?"

The Great Zhou King shook his head, "I didn't know, I've never been to this place, probably only the Culture King has entered. This diagram... I didn't know about it before."

Su Yu nodded, "It's a good thing!"

"If taken out, let some Daofuse observe it, or let some Eternals observe it, they will all gain a lot."

"Opening the Heaven Gate, after all, it's only me, a few, everyone comprehending the Dao, more is just blindly comprehending... this diagram, just makes some Dao more intuitive, more understandable!"

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly.

Blindly comprehending the Dao?

Well, maybe it is.

Just, it's a bit hurtful.

Su Yu sighed, "This time, even if we gain nothing else, just this diagram is enough! More precious than anything!"

He stepped forward, preparing to take the diagram.

This thing is a treasure, it can quickly enhance the Dao insights of his subordinates.

This might be more intuitive than Su Yu showing them the River of Time.

Because Su Yu only conveyed what he saw, he didn't have the ability to turn his insights, his Dao, into others' insights, letting them comprehend and understand on their own.

But this diagram can!

For Su Yu, this diagram is just for reference, after all, he opened the Heaven Gate, he actually sees a lot, the essence of the Dao, Su Yu himself can actually comprehend some, see through some.

But for others... this thing might be enough to drive the masters of rules crazy.

The Human Emperor's explanation of the Dao!

An existence that might rank third since the opening of heaven and earth, explaining the Dao to everyone, what a great temptation.

Su Yu was about to take the diagram, suddenly paused slightly.

The hand he extended stopped for a moment.

Soon, Su Yu showed a hint of surprise.

Suddenly, he took out the Little Stone.

At this moment, a faint glow emanated from the Little Stone.

Su Yu smiled, "Human Emperor... I thought he left it here for anyone to take, turns out there's a test?"

"......"

Everyone was speechless. 

The words hung in the air, suggesting that the item could be casually placed here for anyone to take... Was that even possible? They were also pondering whether this item might be dangerous, wanting to remind Su Yu of potential issues. However, Su Yu had already noticed the problem himself.

Su Yu chuckled, "How interesting!"

He took out a small stone, which emitted a faint glow. Gradually, the glow intensified. After a while, the surface of the stone showed signs of cracking. Su Yu had been using it for some time, and it had always appeared as a stone. But now, he suddenly realized that it might not be a stone at all, just a treasure covered in dust, lying dormant.

"Crack..."

Su Yu heard the sound of something breaking. Gradually, the surface of the stone began to fracture, and a golden light seeped out, causing others to feel a sense of reverence.

Crack!

The sound of breaking continued. After a while, with a bang, the outer layer of the stone suddenly shattered completely, and a golden light illuminated the entire room. A small seal appeared before everyone.

"Xingyu!"

Yes, the seal bore the characters "Xingyu," just like the Luminous Domain Mansion. This seal also had the words Xingyu. It might truly be the name of the Human Emperor!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was slightly stunned. After a moment, he suddenly knelt on one knee, with a complex expression and a sense of nostalgia. After a long while, he softly said, "This humble servant, Zhou Tian, pays respects to Your Majesty!"

Su Yu turned to look at him and laughed, "What's your name?"

The Great Zhou King was embarrassed. After a while, he lowered his head and softly said, "This humble servant's real name is Zhou Tian, but I've used aliases like Zhou Tianfu, Zhou Tianhuo, Zhou Tiandao, Zhou Tianming, Zhou Tianwen, Zhou Tianwu, Zhou Tiansheng, Zhou Tianqi..."

Everyone turned to look at the Great Zhou King, their mouths agape. After a while, Marquis Huoyun murmured, "I... I think I know a Zhou Tianwen..."

The Great Zhou King softly replied, "That's me."

Marquis Huoyun's mouth fell open, and after a while, he exclaimed, "What the... How many people have you impersonated?"

The Great Zhou King softly said, "I didn't impersonate anyone. From beginning to end, it was always me. How could it be called impersonation? I just used different aliases, that's all! I'm not like Lantian, who enjoys impersonating and disguising. I merely changed identities to be less conspicuous."

I didn't impersonate anyone! I'm not Lantian!

Beside him, Lantian, in the guise of a little girl, continued to suck on a lollipop, looking curiously at the Great Zhou King, as if he wasn't talking about himself. After watching for a while, she curiously asked, "Why did you kneel?"

"Seeing the seal is like seeing the emperor!"

The Great Zhou King looked at Su Yu, then at the seal in his hand, and softly said, "I had some suspicions, but only when this seal broke did I confirm that this is the Human Emperor's Human Lord Seal!"

He looked at Su Yu, "I've seen the Human Emperor's Seal before, and it doesn't look like this! However, the Human Emperor's Seal was forged after the unification of the Myriad Realms, created by the Human Emperor with the power of all races! It might have been taken by the Human Emperor, as he could suppress the myriad races with it... This should be the Human Lord Seal left by the Human Emperor! It was forged to unify the human race before the unification of the Myriad Realms!"

The Great Zhou King was filled with emotion, "I seem to have heard of this seal's existence in the past, but it was said to have been lost long ago. Some even said it had merged into the Human Emperor's Seal. Today, I realize it hasn't!"

"Congratulations to His Majesty Emperor Yu for acquiring this seal!"

The Great Zhou King knelt and softly said, "The Human Lord Seal, the Human Emperor's Human Lord Seal... His Majesty Emperor Yu has obtained it and gained recognition. Your Majesty is the true legitimate ruler!"

"Rightfully so!"

The Great Zhou King's voice was high-pitched, "From ancient times to the present, spanning a hundred thousand years, the Culture King left a legacy, the Martial King left descendants, the Radiant King also left descendants, and the Control King betrayed. Only the Human Emperor has never left a legacy!"

"The previous nine Human Lords were merely supported by later generations, without the Human Emperor's legacy, nor did they wield the Human Emperor's Seal. Only Emperor Yu has gained the Human Emperor's recognition, inheriting the Human Lord Seal... If Emperor Yu is not legitimate, who in this world dares claim legitimacy?"

The Great Zhou King's tone was fervent, "Your Majesty, whether inheriting the ancient or founding a new dynasty, in this world, among the human race, only His Majesty Emperor Yu has this qualification!"

Upon hearing this, Marquis Dingjun and the others were slightly taken aback. This was the Human Emperor's Human Lord Seal! It was somewhat unbelievable. The Human Lord Seal, said to have disappeared long ago, had actually appeared.

Countless years had passed, and no one had ever obtained it. Today, it was seen in Su Yu's hands. Previously, everyone was curious about what treasure could suppress the Source of the Dao. Now, they understood!

At this moment, Marquis Dingjun's eyes flickered. After a moment, he slowly knelt, "This humble servant, Dingjun, pays respects to Your Majesty!"

Yunshui, Huoyun, Yingwu, Shadow...

These ancient powerhouses looked at each other, their emotions complex. After a moment, they all knelt in succession.

Was the Great Zhou King doing this on purpose?

They didn't know. But they knew that this act of kneeling signified submission and allegiance.

Su Yu glanced at everyone, showing little emotion, and calmly said, "Rise, there's no need for this! I am not the ancient Human Emperor, and I don't care much for the notion of legitimacy."

"Your Majesty..."

The Great Zhou King wanted to say more, but Su Yu ignored him. At this moment, he turned around, picked up the Xingyu Seal, and pressed it onto the Dao map!

Boom!

With a loud noise, a mark appeared on the Dao map, and the original killing intent all subsided.

Su Yu smiled.

"If I didn't have this seal, would I not have been able to obtain this item?"

But this seal was in the Culture King's Residence! And if Xingyue hadn't mentioned it, who would have known that the Culture King's Residence held this?

It was a deadlock!

Su Yu even wondered if anyone else in this world could obtain this Dao map besides him. The Xingyu Seal, the Culture King's Residence, the White Dog, Xingyue, the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion... So many factors had to come together to take this map. It was too troublesome!

Thinking about it, Su Yu shook his head and stopped dwelling on it. 

Indeed, if it weren't difficult, would it have been his turn? A hundred thousand years! If it were easy to take, would it have waited for him?

Well then!

Holding the Dao map in his hand, it instantly disappeared, appearing in Su Yu's sea of will, standing alongside the Book of Time.

"A fine treasure!"

Su Yu sighed, then looked at the other items in the room and laughed.

"Let's get some new furniture for the Human Emperor!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned. What did he mean?

Su Yu smiled faintly, "The human race lacks treasures. Let's exchange new furniture for the old ones, clean up for the Human Emperor, and bring in some fresh air. It will be nice for the Human Emperor to return to a new environment! Alright, Great Zhou King, lead everyone to do it. Remember, do not damage anything, keep everything as it is!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King was at a loss, feeling helpless. However, he quickly nodded, "The Human Emperor would be willing. I'll handle it immediately."

Su Yu wasn't doing it for himself. The Great Zhou King thought about it and realized that if the Human Emperor knew, he would probably be happy to turn these items into useful things for the human race, as the Human Emperor had a strong sense of responsibility. He would surely agree!

And Su Yu, no longer concerned with them, now had subordinates to handle things. He wouldn't do it himself, as it would be beneath him.

At this moment, he looked at the door, wanting to go out and see. What else was on this ninth floor? It seemed that the Human Emperor had held a meeting on the ninth floor and took everyone away. Before this, Su Yu had speculated that the Human Emperor had opened a passage here, leading people into the River of Time.

Could it be the passage he had just emerged from?

Perhaps not! After all, the passage he had just exited was connected to the Human Emperor's path, and the Human Emperor might not have taken them that way.

Su Yu stopped guessing and stepped towards the door. He would know once he went out to see!
