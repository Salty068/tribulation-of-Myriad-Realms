Chapter 685: Attacking Mingjie, Tiangu Smiled

Outside the Culture King's Residence.

Su Yu ran swiftly, not because he was too busy, but because he was worried Feiqiu would ask him for the stone.

It was a treasure!

Su Yu wasn't stupid. What was Feiqiu's strength?

One swipe of its claw, and the stone was completely unharmed. Even an idiot would know it was a treasure, a great treasure!

To prevent Feiqiu from getting ideas, Su Yu ran first. What if Feiqiu claimed it was the Culture King's treasure and wouldn't give it to him?

Although Xingyue buried it, wasn't it buried in someone else's home?

"Xingyue inexplicably ran to the Culture King's house to bury something... This indicates a good relationship with the Culture King. The Culture King even went to live in the Death Realm for a period to revive her..."

Su Yu pondered these thoughts. What kind of relationship was it?

"Lovers?"

Su Yu bared his teeth. Was the Culture King secretly no longer a bachelor?

Forget it, no need to delve into such matters.

He took out the small stone and carefully sensed it, raising an eyebrow slightly. What exactly was this thing?

Xingyue herself might not even remember what it was.

"Used as a weapon?"

"To smash people?"

"Or some other supreme treasure?"

At Su Yu's current realm, he had many treasures. Ordinary items might not even catch his eye anymore.

He'd keep it for now. Perhaps he'd discover something later.

...

Su Yu flew all the way, quickly leaving the Human Realm.

After exiting the Human Realm, Su Yu swiftly concealed his aura.

He didn't want to bother with Heavendoom City for now. He had already informed Wan Tiansheng to keep an eye on it, or perhaps Lan Tian's clone could monitor it. Both of them were quite skilled at surveillance.

With major events at hand, a few Upper Realm visitors were minor issues.

If he killed Fu King and refined Fu King, or Shenyuan Marquis, or Tianlong Marquis, what secrets wouldn't he know?

Once he could kill West King's Consort, eliminating her might also reveal the secrets of the Control King's lineage.

It just wasn't suitable to kill them now!

To avoid attracting the attention of the myriad races, and also to prevent the Control King's lineage from finding out prematurely.

"First, to Mingjie!"

If he could sneak in, that would be good. If not, Su Yu wouldn't force it.

Upper Realm passage... Ming Race.

Su Yu was actually very curious. How could the myriad races be so at ease entrusting the passage to Mingjie?

Although the other party wasn't weak, if it were him, he would have taken Mingjie long ago!

And the Human Race too. In the last tide, when the Human Race was strong at the beginning, they actually didn't take down the Ming Race?

What were they thinking?

This was a realm that guarded a strategic choke point. Even if he wasn't fighting the myriad races, he should have taken Mingjie first!

Guarding the passage, he could attack upwards and also block the vital route, preventing the enemy from descending.

"Ming Emperor, that old fellow, is quite capable. He might have been hiding his strength before, always keeping a low profile. I need to be wary of him. Last time he tipped me off, he was trying to play both sides."

"He's a smart person, but also a fence-sitter..."

Su Yu continuously assessed everything about Ming Emperor. Attacking Mingjie and trying to take it down would be difficult without Ming Emperor's cooperation.

The Ming Race had quite a few Invincibles, and Ming Emperor was also a top-tier Daofuse expert. Other races entering would be suppressed. Relying on the Human Race to charge in alone, even if they succeeded, the losses wouldn't be small.

With these thoughts, Su Yu reined in his aura and swiftly headed towards Mingjie.

...

Mingjie.

At the peak of Tianming Mountain.

Ming Emperor rose, intending to leave. Not far away, Modang Marquis said indifferently, "Brother Wuming is going back to handle matters again?"

Ming Emperor thought for a moment, then replied, "I feel vaguely uneasy. I'm worried the Human Race will attack my Mingjie! The Abyss Realm has been broken, and the Death Realm passage severed. If Mingjie is also breached, both upper and lower connections will be cut, leaving us at their mercy!"

Shenyuan Marquis sneered, "The Human Race attacking Mingjie? They'll be asking for trouble! Wuming, as long as you don't betray us, with you and me working together, even if Zhou Tianqi comes, he'll fall! If the Human Race really charges in, just tie them down and don't let them leave the realm. That would be seeking their own demise!"

Based on current strength, this was indeed true.

Entering the realm and getting trapped would be a huge problem, because Su Yu's allies would be suppressed upon entering.

The myriad races would also be suppressed, but they had many Eternals and Sunmoon Realm cultivators. Even if suppressed, everyone being suppressed together meant they could still overwhelm their opponents with sheer numbers!

Ming Emperor said calmly, "Betray? If Shenyuan Marquis is so worried, why not destroy my Ming Race and let your Abyss Race take up residence? I'm just afraid you won't have anyone to station here."

Those words were a huge slap in the face!

They really didn't have anyone!

Shenyuan Marquis's expression turned ugly.

Ming Emperor glanced at the three of them, then said calmly, "Gentlemen, this is still my Ming Race's territory after all. Do I need your permission just to leave and take a look?"

Yunxing Marquis chuckled, "Brother Wuming misunderstands. Modang and the others mean well. Brother Wuming, please feel free."

Ming Emperor said nothing, disappearing from the spot.

As soon as he left, Shenyuan Marquis said in a deep voice, "The Ming Race... Wuming, this fellow, has a strange mind. No one knows what he's thinking! Both of you, still be careful!"

Modang Marquis's eyes were gloomy. "Tianming Marquis is still alive, he's not easy to deal with! That old fellow's strength is not weak. Even Yunxing and I together might not be able to defeat him..."

He shook his head, "The Ming Race has always been indecisive, but for many years, they have never favored any side. This tide, they shouldn't do anything foolish. If they really choose a side, it won't be the Human Race! In the last tide, when Hundred Battle King attacked, Tianming Marquis personally descended to guard the realm and didn't yield the passage to the Human Race. Shenyuan, you don't need to worry too much."

"Alright then!"

Shenyuan Marquis said no more. Any further talk would sound like instigation.

...

At the Mingjie passage entrance.

At this moment, several Invincibles were stationed there, including Changhe, a genius of the Ming Race.

Seeing Ming Emperor arrive, Changhe quickly stepped forward and whispered, "Patriarch!"

Ming Emperor nodded slightly, glanced around, and a long river surged in his eyes. He looked around for a while, then suddenly looked at a tree. On the tree, a small black bird was resting and circling.

It was silent, its aura extremely weak. A normal person would definitely overlook it.

Ming Emperor looked at the bird. At this moment, the River of Fate in his eyes reflected the Great Dao. Vaguely, he seemed to see something, seeing countless spirit-like things appearing above the bird's head.

Ming Emperor stared at the bird, and the black bird remained motionless, as if asleep.

Ming Emperor watched for a while, and the bird's wings fluttered slightly. Changhe, seeing Ming Emperor looking that way, also looked over and chuckled, "Patriarch, what's wrong? Is there anything special about this Black Sky Crow?"

Ming Emperor chuckled, "Nothing, just keep an eye on the passage entrance!"

"Understood, Patriarch, rest assured!"

Ming Emperor nodded slightly, saying no more, and walked towards the passage. Changhe quickly followed, "Patriarch, are you going out?"

"No! Just going to check the passage entrance."

As Ming Emperor walked out, he said softly, "Have you learned the clan's foundational technique, the Kuitian Eye?"

"Not yet."

Changhe said awkwardly, "It's still too early."

"Pay more attention. This is an extremely important Dao of technique. The Ming Race has survived to this day, enduring for so long, and it's related to this technique!"

"Understood!"

As they spoke, Ming Emperor had already reached the passage entrance. He stood quietly at the entrance. Mingjie was very high up. Other great realms were level with the Allheaven Battlefield ground. Flying out of the realm passage would lead to the ground.

Only Mingjie was special, suspended in the air.

Ming Emperor overlooked the world and said softly, "Changhe, do you know why, among the myriad races, in every tide, the Ming Race was never supreme, yet it could establish a realm in this starry sky?"

Changhe pondered for a moment, then replied, "It is said that our clan's Emperor back then made a bet with the Culture King that the Ming Race could see through all fate. The Culture King lost, so our Ming Race won this treasure land! Connecting to the Heavenly Fate above, situated at the source of the Great Dao, our clan's Emperor established the realm here..."

"Nonsense!"

Ming Emperor chuckled, "What bet? The truth is, back then, the Human Race hadn't unified the world yet. The Culture King entered my Mingjie and said that my Ming Race's Great Dao was very interesting, knowing when to advance and retreat, understanding heavenly secrets. He asked my grandfather if the Ming Race would be destroyed today?"

Changhe had never known this before and said in surprise, "Is that so? Did the Emperor see the future fate then?"

"Fate?"

Ming Emperor smiled, "Did he even need to look? No need. My grandfather said the Ming Race would not be destroyed! So, the Culture King praised him greatly, suspended Mingjie in the air, and made it responsible for connecting to the Upper Realm, jokingly saying that the Ming Race had a long life, and even if he died, the Ming Race might not be destroyed, so guarding a gate was quite good."

Changhe was somewhat dazed.

Ming Emperor smiled, "Do you understand?"

Changhe said in a deep voice, "You mean, the Emperor back then felt... the Culture King could destroy the Ming Race?"

"What do you think?"

Changhe thought for a moment, then said uncertainly, "Our former Emperor was very powerful, right?"

"Of course."

"Even in Mingjie, he couldn't defeat the Culture King?"

"Foolish. Even if our clan had the realm's power bonus, the Culture King wouldn't be restricted. Do you think he could contend with the Culture King?"

"This... probably not, right?"

Changhe was uncertain, and Ming Emperor didn't say much more to him, only sighing, "A casual remark back then decided the fate of the Ming Race! The Ming Race continued for another hundred thousand years! And now... I feel the fluctuations of the River of Fate. Corpses will litter thousands of miles, and blood will stain the heavens!"

"Patriarch, then..."

Ming Emperor ignored him. At this moment, Ming Emperor's Great Dao fluctuated. The moment it fluctuated, Shenyuan Marquis and the others actually arrived, watching him from behind. What was Wuming doing?

Yunxing Marquis, however, thought of something, glanced at Ming Emperor, and frowned slightly, "Kuitian Eye?"

At these words, the other two also remembered something.

Both frowned!

What did he mean?

Shenyuan Marquis also knew this technique and said in a deep voice, "Wuming..."

Yunxing Marquis stopped him, frowning and remaining silent, transmitting, "Let him look. Once the Kuitian Eye is used, his source qi will be greatly damaged. Is this fellow preparing to look at the future of the Myriad Realms?"

...

Ming Emperor ignored them.

Soon, on his forehead, an eye that seemed to be asleep slowly opened.

This eye was somewhat similar to the Heaven Gate.

But it was also different.

The eye slowly opened. Ming Emperor's hair, which was originally white and infinitely lustrous, now gradually became somewhat dry and lost its luster. His skin, which was previously like a child's, now gradually shriveled.

He struggled to open that eye!

At this moment, the world in his third eye was completely different!

At this moment, he saw many things. He first looked towards the Immortal Realm. Above the Immortal Realm, a phantom figure suddenly appeared. It was Tiangu. Across an infinite distance, Tiangu seemed to sense something and looked this way.

Ming Emperor ignored him and continued to look at the Immortal Realm.

He only saw black qi hovering above the Immortal Realm, blood qi overflowing, and figures falling. He seemed to see Tiangu, and yet he didn't...

Ming Emperor gasped softly, then looked towards the Devil Realm.

The Devil Realm was also filled with monstrous blood qi at this moment, countless figures appearing, countless figures falling. Looking at the Divine Realm, the situation was similar, but slightly better.

Soon, Ming Emperor's eyes became somewhat weak.

He gasped, moving his head to look towards the Human Realm. Before he even saw the Human Realm, as he swept past the Sea of Stars, his heart was greatly shaken!

"Grand Dream City!"

At this moment, he saw Grand Dream City. He only saw golden lights flashing on the sea above Grand Dream City, and lines of fate extending towards the Human Realm.

His heart trembled!

What was that...?

The Old Turtle of Grand Dream City was powerful, but was the Old Turtle's future fate so strange?

"Not just the Old Turtle, it's not one person, those are the lines of fate of many people!"

His heart shook, and he quickly shifted his gaze, sweeping across, seeing some Ancient Cities. Above those Ancient Cities, black qi also overflowed. However, this black qi did not carry blood qi, but was purely black qi.

What did this mean?

Ming Emperor vaguely understood, greatly shaken, and quickly shifted his gaze to look towards the Human Realm!

At this glance, before he even saw the Human Realm, his heart trembled violently!

Boom!

His third eye shattered. And at this very moment, in the shattered third eye, he saw a scene: right between him and the Human Realm, or rather, right before his eyes, a person suddenly appeared. That person, with a strange expression, suddenly smashed his eye with a stone!

"Pfft!"

A mouthful of blood spurted out!

"Patriarch!"

Several Ming Race powerhouses were shocked and quickly rushed over. Changhe supported Ming Emperor, his face full of worry. Behind him, Yunxing Marquis's voice faintly came, "Wuming, what did you see?"

Ming Emperor coughed blood. "Cannot say... Heavenly secrets must not be revealed! It's just a technique, it doesn't mean anything."

Yunxing Marquis frowned, transmitting, "Did you see the future of the Human Race?"

"Marquis overestimates me. How can I, a mere mortal, peer into the future of the Human Race and the myriad races!"

Ming Emperor gasped, "I just saw that the blood qi of the heavens is boiling. This is a sign of a chaotic era. I saw it once in the Ninth Tide, and this time, it seems even more intense!"

At these words, the three's expressions changed.

More intense than the Ninth Tide?

Shenyuan Marquis said incredulously, "You must have seen wrong?"

Ming Emperor coughed, chuckling, "Believe it and it is so, disbelieve it and it is not!"

Then, he smiled, "Forget it, I don't even believe these things myself, but it's certain that many lives will die!"

That was true, people would definitely die.

Yunxing Marquis transmitted, "I saw you glance towards the Human Realm, and your Kuitian Eye shattered. A backlash?"

"No, the previous consumption was too great. Looking at the Divine, Devil, and myriad realms, I couldn't sustain it."

Yunxing Marquis didn't ask further and instantly disappeared.

"You all withdraw too!"

Ming Emperor smiled, "It's fine, everyone leave. I'll take another look!"

The other Ming Race powerhouses, though worried, could only leave. Changhe continued to stay by his side.

Ming Emperor looked towards the Human Race's direction again.

At this moment, he closed his eyes in thought. Was the scene he just saw the future, or the present?

The person who smashed him seemed to be Su Yu!

With a strange expression, he smashed his eye with a stone!

That was a line of fate, not something that actually happened. It could only mean that when he looked at the Human Realm just now, he was blocked by Su Yu and a stone. Su Yu might have discovered something, or his Eye of Fate wasn't strong enough and was shattered by him!

"Su Yu..."

He murmured inwardly. The next moment, he suddenly opened his eyes!

Su Yu, was on this line!

The line from Mingjie to the Human Realm!

He had come!

He had really come.

It wasn't an illusion, not the future, but the present. Su Yu might not be far from him, perhaps even right in front, just concealing his tracks!

He looked forward, his expression gradually becoming solemn.

Also, the golden lights from Grand Dream City, and the black lights above the other Ancient Cities, what did they all represent?

"Powerhouses, death spirits, Su Yu..."

"Death Realm!"

"Old Turtle's side, he's not alone. There are other powerhouses, all lurking!"

"Not just one, many!"

"Did something happen in the Death Realm? Su Yu hasn't appeared much these days. Could it be that he's in the Death Realm?"

"Death Realm, four Heavenly King-level powerhouses, three of whom are hostile to the Human Race..."

Countless thoughts arose. He looked into the distance again. He felt that Su Yu was nearby.

A thought arose in his mind, was he... going to launch a surprise attack on Mingjie?

Given his audacity, it might not be impossible!

"Was the Death Realm flattened by him? Impossible! But... the Ancient Cities seem to have undergone some changes!"

Ming Emperor suddenly felt annoyed. He should have looked at the Iron Devourer Realm and other Human Race alliance realms for a bit longer just now.

At this moment, he could no longer use the Kuitian Eye.

With these thoughts, he suddenly looked at Changhe, "You're familiar with Jiuyue, Tun Tian, and the others. Send a message to Jiuyue, saying you're about to achieve the Dao and want to invite him to observe your breakthrough!"

Changhe was stunned. "That wouldn't be good!"

"Quick!"

Alright, Changhe had no choice but to send a message. Just as he sent it, the space before him suddenly fluctuated, and the message was cut off. Ming Emperor abruptly turned around. Behind him, Shenyuan Marquis said faintly, "Add an insurance. No need for messages! Don't contact the outside world recently!"

Ming Emperor looked at him faintly. "Shenyuan, you're interfering with my clan's internal affairs. Do you know the consequences?"

Shenyuan Marquis said calmly, "This is the will of the various races, not my own. Wuming, who are you having Changhe send a message to now?"

"Changhe is about to achieve the Dao. It's not good for him to go out now. I asked him to invite some friends to observe. Is there a problem?"

"Later!"

Shenyuan Marquis chuckled, "No need to rush!"

With that, the person disappeared.

Ming Emperor frowned slightly. At this moment, he also sensed that a barrier had appeared near Mingjie. It was set up by Shenyuan Marquis, cutting off Mingjie's connection with the outside world.

Bastard!

Ming Emperor snorted inwardly!

He didn't ask Changhe to send any more messages. Offending the myriad races now was unnecessary. He looked again in the direction of the Human Realm he had just seen. He frowned, then suddenly thought of something.

He chuckled. Perhaps... it would be even more interesting!

At this moment, his Great Dao fluctuated slightly!

...

At the same time.

Less than a hundred miles from Mingjie, in a cloud, Su Yu had transformed into a small cloud, lurking within.

He also felt a bit strange. Just now, it seemed like the old fellow from the Ming Race was peeking at him, and he had retaliated!

Was he discovered?

Su Yu felt it when he retaliated. He seemed to sense the other party looking at him, a special power of the Great Dao extending towards him. Su Yu subconsciously threw a punch at the other party. As for smashing him with a stone, he really hadn't, but the stone he had put away earlier did vibrate slightly. Su Yu didn't pay much attention to it.

"Was I discovered?"

"Discovered... then so be it!"

Su Yu muttered inwardly, continuing to look towards Mingjie. He seemed to see Ming Emperor in the distance, saying something to Changhe.

"That old fellow, so perceptive!"

Su Yu sighed inwardly. The next moment, his eyes suddenly became strange. At this moment, he seemed to see something. Su Yu quickly rubbed his eyes. Soon, the Heaven Gate appeared.

At this moment, he saw it!

He saw a Great Dao appearing in the distant void, vaguely seeing something. The distance was a bit far, not too clear, but still visible.

That Great Dao was somewhat ethereal.

And on the Great Dao, a person suddenly appeared, ethereal and graceful, seemingly from the Immortal Race.

Then, it changed, transforming into a demonic figure.

Was it from the Devil Race?

Next, a black-robed figure appeared. Was that from the Abyss Race?

Su Yu's eyes flickered. What did this mean?

Abyss Race, Immortal Race, Devil Race...

And just then, the Great Dao began to change again, like a door, with three people walking out of it together.

Su Yu frowned. "A door... three powerhouses, Abyss Race... Shenyuan Marquis?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow. "Shenyuan Marquis is behind, two are in front. Are the two stronger than Shenyuan Marquis?"

"One from the Immortal Race, one from the Devil Race, both descended from the Upper Realm?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. Was Ming Emperor trying to tell him something?

The Great Dao was changing!

In the current world, besides himself, who else could see the changes in the power of the Great Dao?

Strange!

Ming Emperor didn't know I opened the Heaven Gate, did he?

"Three powerhouses, not one..."

Su Yu frowned. Was it true or false?

He wasn't sure if Ming Emperor was warning him.

And just then, Ming Emperor's Great Dao continued to fluctuate. The next moment, a
