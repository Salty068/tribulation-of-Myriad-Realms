Chapter 685: Attacking the Life Realm, Tiangu Smiles

Outside the Culture King's Residence.

Su Yu was sprinting at full speed. It wasn't that he was overly busy, but he was worried that the Fat Ball would come asking him for the stone.

That stone was a treasure!

Su Yu wasn't foolish. What kind of strength did the Fat Ball possess? A single swipe from it, and the stone remained unscathed. Even a fool would know that this was a precious treasure!

To prevent the Fat Ball from getting any ideas, Su Yu decided to run first and talk later. Otherwise, what if the Fat Ball claimed it was the Culture King's treasure and refused to give it to him?

Although it was buried by Xingyue, wasn't it buried in someone else's house?

"Why did Xingyue go to the Culture King's place to bury something... This suggests a good relationship with the Culture King. The Culture King even went to the Death Realm for a while to revive her..."

Su Yu pondered these connections. What kind of relationship was this?

"Lovers?"

Su Yu grinned, wondering if the Culture King secretly wasn't single anymore.

Forget it, no need to delve into that.

He took out the small stone and carefully sensed it, raising an eyebrow. What exactly was this thing?

Even Xingyue might not remember what it was.

"Is it meant to be used as a weapon?"

"For smashing people?"

"Or is it some other supreme treasure?"

At Su Yu's current level, he had many treasures, and ordinary items didn't catch his eye.

He decided to keep it for now; perhaps he would discover its use later.

...

Su Yu flew swiftly, soon leaving the Human Realm.

Once out of the Human Realm, Su Yu quickly concealed his aura.

He wasn't interested in dealing with Heavendoom City at the moment. He had already informed Wan Tiansheng to keep an eye on it, or perhaps let Lantian's clone monitor it. Both were quite capable of surveillance.

In the face of major events, a few individuals from the Upper Realm were insignificant.

Having killed the Symbol King, and potentially refining the Symbol King or Abyssal Marquis, or even the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, what secrets could remain hidden from him?

Once he could kill the West King's Consort, eliminating her would mean that the secrets of the Control King's lineage would no longer be secrets.

But now wasn't the right time to kill her!

To avoid attracting the attention of the myriad races and to prevent the Control King's lineage from finding out prematurely.

"First, head to the Life Realm!"

If he could infiltrate it, that would be great. If not, Su Yu wouldn't force it.

The Upper Realm passage... the Life Race.

Su Yu found it strange. Why were the myriad races so trusting, leaving the passage in the hands of the Life Realm?

Although the other side wasn't weak, if it were him, he would have taken over the Life Realm long ago!

And the Human Race too. In the previous tide, when the Human Race was strong, they didn't take over the Life Race?

What were they thinking?

This was a strategic choke point. Even if I don't attack the myriad races, I should first take over the Life Realm!

Guarding the passage, I can attack upwards or block the path, preventing the other side from descending.

"The Life Emperor, that old fellow, isn't weak. He might have been hiding his strength all along, remaining silent. I need to be cautious. Last time, he tipped me off, having a foot in both camps."

"He's a smart person, but also a fence-sitter..."

Su Yu continuously assessed everything about the Life Emperor. To forcibly take the Life Realm, without the Life Emperor's cooperation, would be difficult.

The Life Race had many invincibles, and the Life Emperor was a top-tier Daofuse expert. Other races entering would be suppressed, and relying on the Human Race to kill their way in would result in significant losses.

With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu concealed his aura and quickly headed towards the Life Realm.

...

Life Realm.

At the peak of Destiny Mountain.

The Life Emperor rose to leave. Not far away, Abyssal Marquis said indifferently, "Nameless Daoist Brother, are you going back to handle matters again?"

The Life Emperor thought for a moment and said, "I feel a bit uneasy. I'm worried the Human Race might attack my Life Realm! The Abyssal Realm has been broken, the Death Realm passage severed. If the Life Realm is also broken, we'll be at the mercy of others!"

Abyssal Marquis sneered, "The Human Race attacking the Life Realm? Let them try their luck! Nameless, as long as you don't betray us, if we join forces, even if Zhou Tianqi comes, he'll fall! If the Human Race really invades, trap them, don't let them leave the realm, and they'll be courting death!"

Given the current strength, that was indeed the case.

Entering the realm and getting trapped would be a huge problem because Su Yu's allies would be suppressed upon entering.

The myriad races would be too, but they had many Eternals and Sunmoon experts. Even if suppressed, they could overwhelm you with sheer numbers!

The Life Emperor said calmly, "Betray? If Abyssal Marquis is so worried, why not destroy my Life Race and let your Abyssal Race take over! I'm just afraid you have no one to send."

These words were a slap in the face!

There was indeed no one!

Abyssal Marquis's face turned ugly.

The Life Emperor glanced at the three of them and said calmly, "This is still the territory of my Life Race. Do I need your permission to leave and take a look?"

Meteor Marquis smiled, "Nameless Daoist Brother, you've misunderstood. Abyssal and the others mean well. Nameless Brother, feel free to go!"

The Life Emperor said nothing more and vanished into thin air.

Once he left, Abyssal Marquis said in a deep voice, "The Life Race... Nameless, that guy, is unpredictable. No one knows what he's thinking! You two, be cautious!"

Magic Marquis's eyes were shadowy as he said, "Destiny Marquis is still alive, not easy to deal with! That old fellow isn't weak. Even if I join forces with Meteor, we might not be able to defeat him..."

Shaking his head, he continued, "The Life Race has always been indecisive, but over the years, they've never favored any side. This tide, they shouldn't do anything foolish. If they do choose a side, it won't be the Human Race! In the last tide, when Hundred Battles attacked, Destiny Marquis personally descended to guard the realm, not yielding the passage to the Human Race. Abyssal, you needn't worry too much."

"Alright then!"

Abyssal Marquis said no more, as continuing would seem like incitement.

...

At the Life Realm passage.

At this moment, several invincibles were stationed, including the Life Race's genius, Changhe.

Seeing the Life Emperor arrive, Changhe quickly stepped forward and whispered, "Patriarch!"

The Life Emperor nodded slightly, glanced around, and in his eyes, a long river surged. He looked around for a while, then suddenly focused on a tree. On that tree, a small black bird was quietly resting.

Silent and with an extremely weak aura, an ordinary person would definitely overlook it.

The Life Emperor looked at the bird, and at this moment, in his eyes, the river of destiny reflected the great path. Vaguely, he seemed to see something, seeing countless spirit-like things above the bird's head.

The Life Emperor stared at the bird, which remained motionless, as if asleep.

The Life Emperor watched for a while, and the bird's wings fluttered slightly. Changhe, seeing the Life Emperor looking that way, also looked over and smiled, "Patriarch, what's special about that black crow?"

The Life Emperor chuckled, "Nothing, just keep an eye on the passage!"

"Understood, Patriarch, rest assured!"

The Life Emperor nodded slightly, said no more, and walked towards the passage. Changhe quickly followed, "Patriarch, are you going out?"

"Not going out! Just checking the passage."

As the Life Emperor walked, he said softly, "Have you learned the clan's secret technique, the Eye of Heaven?"

"Not yet."

Changhe said awkwardly, "Still early."

"Pay more attention. It's an extremely important technique. The Life Race has survived until now, never declining, and it's related to this technique!"

"Understood!"

As they spoke, the Life Emperor had already reached the passage. He stood quietly at the passage entrance. The Life Realm was high up; other great realms were level with the ground of the Allheaven Battlefield. Flying out of the realm's passage would reach the ground.

Only the Life Realm was special, suspended in the air.

The Life Emperor looked down at the world and said softly, "Changhe, do you know why, in any tide, the Life Race is never the dominant race among the myriad races, yet we can establish a realm in this starry sky?"

Changhe pondered for a moment and said, "It's said that our clan's emperor once made a bet with the Culture King, claiming the Life Race could see through all destinies. In the end, the Culture King lost, so our Life Race won this treasure land! Connecting to the heavenly mandate, situated at the source of the great path, our emperor established the realm here..."

"Nonsense!"

The Life Emperor chuckled, "What bet? The truth is, back then, the Human Race hadn't unified the world yet. The Culture King entered our Life Realm, saying our Life Race's great path was interesting, knowing when to advance and retreat, understanding the heavenly secrets. He asked my grandfather if the Life Race would be destroyed that day."

Changhe was surprised to hear this for the first time, "Really? Did the emperor see the future destiny?"

"Destiny?"

The Life Emperor laughed, "Is there a need to see? No need. My grandfather said the Life Race wouldn't be destroyed! So, the Culture King greatly admired him, suspended the Life Realm, tasked with connecting the Upper Realm, jokingly saying the Life Race had a long destiny. Even if he died, the Life Race might not be destroyed. Guarding the gate was quite fitting."

Changhe was a bit dazed.

The Life Emperor smiled, "Understand now?"

Changhe said solemnly, "You mean, the emperor back then thought... the Culture King could destroy the Life Race?"

"What do you think?"

Changhe thought for a moment, uncertain, "Our former emperor was very powerful, right?"

"Of course."

"Even in the Life Realm, he couldn't match the Culture King?"

"Foolish, even if our race had the realm's power boost, the Culture King wouldn't be restricted. Do you think he could match the Culture King?"

"Well... probably not?"

Changhe was unsure, and the Life Emperor didn't say more, only sighing, "A casual joke back then determined the Life Race's destiny! The Life Race has continued for hundreds of thousands of years! And now... I feel the river of destiny stirring, corpses strewn for thousands of miles, blood splattering the heavens!"

"Patriarch, then..."

The Life Emperor ignored him. At this moment, his great path fluctuated, and in an instant, Abyssal Marquis and the others arrived, watching him from behind. What was Nameless doing?

Meteor Marquis, however, thought of something, glanced at the Life Emperor, and frowned slightly, "Eye of Heaven?"

As soon as he said this, the other two remembered something.

They all frowned!

What did it mean?

Abyssal Marquis also knew this technique and said in a deep voice, "Nameless..."

Meteor Marquis stopped him, frowning without speaking, transmitting, "Let him see. Using the Eye of Heaven greatly depletes one's energy. Is this guy preparing to see the future of the Myriad Realms?"

...

The Life Emperor ignored them.

Soon, on his forehead, an eye that seemed to be asleep slowly opened.

This eye was somewhat similar to the Heaven Gate.

But it was different.

The eye slowly opened, and the Life Emperor's hair, originally white and infinitely lustrous, gradually became dry, losing its sheen. His skin, previously like a child's, also gradually shriveled.

He struggled to open that eye!

At this moment, the world seen through his third eye was entirely different!

He saw many things. First, he looked toward the Immortal Realm. Suddenly, a shadow appeared in the sky above the Immortal Realm. It was Tiangu, who seemed to sense something and looked in this direction.

The Fate Emperor ignored him and continued observing the Immortal Realm. He saw black mist hovering in the sky, blood energy spilling out, and countless figures falling. It seemed like he saw Tiangu, yet it also seemed like he didn't...

The Fate Emperor took a deep breath and turned his gaze toward the Devil Realm.

The Devil Realm was also filled with overwhelming blood energy, countless figures appearing and disappearing. The situation in the Divine Realm was similar, though slightly better.

Soon, the Fate Emperor's gaze grew weak. He panted, moving his head to look toward the Human Realm. Before he could see it, his heart trembled as he glanced at the Sea of Stars.

"Hongmeng City!"

At that moment, he saw Hongmeng City. Above the sea surface, golden lights flickered, and threads of destiny stretched toward the Human Realm.

His heart shook!

What was that?

The Old Turtle of Hongmeng City was formidable, but could the Old Turtle's destiny and future be so peculiar?

"It's not just the Old Turtle; it's the destiny lines of many people!"

His heart trembled, and he quickly shifted his gaze, sweeping past several ancient cities. Above those cities, black mist also spread, but it was pure black mist without any blood energy.

What did that signify?

The Fate Emperor had a vague understanding, feeling deeply shaken. He quickly turned his gaze toward the Human Realm!

As he looked, before he could see the Human Realm, his heart shook violently!

Boom!

His third eye shattered, and at that moment, he saw a scene through the broken eye. Between him and the Human Realm, or perhaps right before him, a figure suddenly appeared. That person, with a peculiar expression, suddenly smashed his eye with a stone!

"Poof!"

A mouthful of blood spurted out!

"Patriarch!"

Several powerful members of the Fate Clan trembled and rushed over. Changhe supported the Fate Emperor, looking worried. Behind them, the voice of Marquis Falling Star faintly came, "Wuming, what did you see?"

The Fate Emperor coughed blood, "I cannot say... the secrets of heaven cannot be revealed! It's just a technique, it doesn't mean anything."

Marquis Falling Star frowned and transmitted his voice, "Did you see the future of the Human Race?"

"Marquis, you overestimate me. How could I possibly glimpse the future of the Human Race and the myriad races?"

The Fate Emperor panted, "I only saw the blood energy of the myriad realms boiling. It's a sign of chaos. I also observed the Ninth Tide, and this time, it seems even more intense than the last!"

At these words, the three of them changed color.

More intense than the Ninth Tide?

Marquis Abyss couldn't believe it, "Did you see it wrong?"

The Fate Emperor coughed and laughed, "Believe it, and it exists. Don't believe it, and it doesn't!"

With that, he laughed, "Forget it, even I don't believe these things, but many beings will certainly die!"

That was true; people would definitely die.

Marquis Falling Star transmitted his voice, "I saw you glance at the Human Realm, and your Heaven-Peering Eye shattered, backlash?"

"No, the earlier consumption was too great. I couldn't sustain it after looking at the myriad realms of gods and demons."

Marquis Falling Star didn't ask further and disappeared in an instant.

"You all should leave too!"

The Fate Emperor smiled, "It's fine, all of you go. I'll take another look!"

Although the other powerful members of the Fate Clan were worried, they could only leave. Changhe continued to stay by his side.

The Fate Emperor looked again in the direction of the Human Race.

At this moment, he closed his eyes in contemplation. The scene he just saw, was it the future or the present?

The person who smashed him seemed to be Su Yu!

With a peculiar expression, he smashed his eye with a stone!

That was a line of destiny, not something that actually happened. It only meant that when he looked at the Human Realm, he was blocked by Su Yu and a stone. Perhaps Su Yu discovered something, or perhaps his Eye of Destiny wasn't strong enough, and Su Yu shattered it!

"Su Yu..."

He murmured in his heart, and the next moment, his eyes suddenly opened!

Su Yu was on this line!

On the line from the Fate Realm to the Human Realm!

He was here!

He really was here.

It wasn't an illusion, not the future, but the present. Su Yu might not be far away, perhaps right in front, just concealing his presence!

He looked ahead, his gaze gradually growing solemn.

Moreover, the golden lights of Hongmeng City and the black lights above other ancient cities, what did they represent?

"Powerful beings, undead, Su Yu..."

"Death Realm!"

"Over at the Old Turtle's side, it's not just him; there are other powerful beings, all lurking!"

"Not just one, many!"

"Has something happened in the Death Realm? Su Yu hasn't appeared much these days. Could it be that he's in the Death Realm?"

"In the Death Realm, among the four Heavenly King-level powerhouses, three are hostile to the Human Race..."

Countless thoughts arose. He looked again into the distance, feeling that Su Yu was nearby.

A thought arose in his heart. Was he... planning to attack the Fate Realm?

With his boldness, it wasn't impossible!

"Could it be that he has cleared the Death Realm? Impossible! But... the ancient cities seem to have changed!"

The Fate Emperor suddenly felt regret. He should have observed the Iron Devourer Realm and those allied with the Human Race for a while longer.

At this moment, he couldn't use the Heaven-Peering Eye anymore.

With some thoughts in his mind, he suddenly looked at Changhe, "You are familiar with Jiuyue and Tuntian. Send a message to Jiuyue, saying you want to prove your Dao and invite him to observe your Dao-proving!"

Changhe was taken aback, "Isn't that inappropriate?"

"Quickly!"

Alright, Changhe had no choice but to send a message. Just as he sent it, the space in front of him fluctuated, and the message was cut off. The Fate Emperor suddenly turned around. Behind him, Marquis Abyss said faintly, "Add a layer of insurance. No need to send messages! No contact with the outside world for now!"

The Fate Emperor looked at him coldly, "Abyss, you are interfering with my clan's internal affairs. Do you know the consequences?"

Marquis Abyss said calmly, "This is the will of the various races, not mine. Wuming, who were you asking Changhe to contact?"

"Changhe is about to prove his Dao. It's not convenient for him to go out now. I asked him to invite some friends to observe. Is there a problem?"

"Later!"

Marquis Abyss smiled, "No rush!"

With that, he disappeared.

The Fate Emperor frowned slightly. At this moment, he also sensed that a barrier had been set up near the Fate Realm by Marquis Abyss, cutting off the Fate Realm from the outside world.

Scoundrel!

The Fate Emperor snorted coldly in his heart!

He didn't ask Changhe to send a message again. There was no need to offend the myriad races now. He looked again in the direction of the Human Realm, frowning as he suddenly thought of something.

He chuckled, perhaps... it would be more interesting!

At this moment, his great path fluctuated slightly!

...

Meanwhile.

Less than a hundred miles from the Fate Realm, within a cloud, Su Yu transformed into a small cloud, lurking within.

He also felt something unusual. Just now, it seemed like the old fellow from the Fate Clan was spying on him, and he retaliated!

Was he discovered?

Su Yu felt it when he retaliated. It seemed like someone was watching him, a special power of the great path extending toward him. Su Yu instinctively punched back. As for the stone smashing him, that didn't actually happen, but the stone he had just put away did tremble slightly. Su Yu didn't pay much attention to it.

"Was I discovered?"

"Discovered... then so be it!"

Su Yu muttered in his heart, continuing to look toward the Fate Realm. He seemed to see the Fate Emperor in the distance, talking to Changhe.

"Old fellow, truly perceptive!"

Su Yu sighed in his heart. The next moment, his gaze turned peculiar. At this moment, he seemed to see something. Su Yu quickly rubbed his eyes, and soon, the Heaven Gate appeared.

At this moment, he saw it!

He saw, in the distant void, a great path appearing, vaguely seeing something. The distance was a bit far, not too clear, but still visible.

That great path seemed somewhat illusory.

And on the great path, a person suddenly appeared, exuding immortal energy, seemingly from the Immortal Race.

Then, it changed, transforming into a figure filled with devilish energy.

Was it from the Devil Race?

Then, a black-robed figure appeared, from the Abyssal Race?

Su Yu's eyes flickered, what did this mean?

Abyssal Race, Immortal Race, Devil Race...

And at this moment, the great path began to change, like a door, with three people walking out together.

Su Yu frowned, "A door... three powerful beings, Abyssal Race... Marquis Abyss?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Marquis Abyss at the back, two in front, two marquises stronger than Marquis Abyss?"

"One from the Immortal Race, one from the Devil Race, both coming down from the Upper Realm?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, was the Fate Emperor telling him something?

The great path was changing!

In the current world, who else could see the changes in the power of the great path besides himself?

Strange!

I opened the Heaven Gate, the Fate Emperor shouldn't know that, right?

"Three powerful beings, not just one..."

Su Yu frowned, was it true or not?

He wasn't sure if the Fate Emperor was warning him.

And at this moment, the Fate Emperor's great path continued to fluctuate. The next moment, an old man with white hair appeared, talking about himself?

The old man spat blood... then... then turned around and left.

"What does that mean? Is this a picture story? Damn, if you really want to warn me, can't you just use the power of the great path to form some words? Is this necessary? Or is it that your great path can't form words?"

"The old man spat blood and left, does it mean you're leaving, injured?"

"Looking at me?"

One thought after another emerged in Su Yu's mind, feeling extremely peculiar at this moment.

What was going on!

...

At the same time.

The Fate Emperor's eyes were gloomy, coldly saying, "Marquis Abyss, come out and remove the barrier, otherwise..."

No one responded!

The Fate Emperor frowned, then sneered, "Forget it! Since the myriad races don't trust this old man, then so be it!"

With that, he turned and walked into the realm, saying indifferently, "Withdraw, let Marquis Abyss guard here. Since he doesn't trust us, then don't block anything here. The Human Race knows Marquis Abyss is here, you handle it yourself! It's best to seal off the Fate Realm!"

Changhe and several invincible members of the Fate Clan frowned. A powerful member of the Fate Clan hurriedly said, "Patriarch, should we give up the passage?"

"Give it up!"

The Fate Emperor said coldly, "Even if we don't give it up, someone is always watching! It's better to give it up. If the Human Race attacks, you won't be able to do anything. Let Marquis Abyss handle it!"

In the distance, Marquis Abyss reappeared, chuckling softly, "Brother Nomad, you've misunderstood!"

The Emperor of Fate looked at him coldly, "For nine tides, the Fate Clan has remained impartial. Yet, during this tide, you have consistently targeted us! In the last tide, the Hundred Battle King approached me several times, seeking my assistance... I refused each time. Our clan's Marquis Destiny even personally confronted the Hundred Battle King... Abyss, don't push too far. If you truly force the Fate Clan to side with the Human Clan, do you think the myriad races will support the Abyssal Race to replace us?"

Marquis Abyss laughed, "It's a misunderstanding!"

"Guard it yourself!"

The Emperor of Fate said icily, "I don't want the children of my clan to become pawns in your battles with the Human Clan! Let's go!"

A group of Fate Clan experts, though reluctant, had no choice but to yield the passageway as the Emperor had ordered. Marquis Abyss did not stop them, silently watching them leave.

Soon, Marquis Meteor and Marquis Demon appeared, both looking somewhat surprised. "He left? Abandoned the passage?"

The Fate Realm had always been guarded by their own at the passageway! The Fate Clan was unwilling to hand over their territory, even if the myriad races wished to station there. Yet, this time, they actually yielded.

Marquis Meteor frowned, "Could it be that he foresaw danger? He just used the Eye of Heaven, did he see something?"

Marquis Demon thought for a moment and laughed, "So what if there's danger? Securing the entrance is a good thing! The news of our descent hasn't leaked! Securing the entrance prevents interference. If the Human Clan truly invades the Fate Realm, we would be in danger. If Nomad doesn't intervene, or simply intercepts us at the realm entrance, we would be suppressed! Now it's good, if the Human Clan truly comes, we can exit the realm to fight anytime. With Abyss, even if the Old Turtle and the Great Zhou King join forces, we three are not afraid!"

"Even if the Human Clan comes out in full force, holding on for a while, Tiangu and the others will arrive, making it even safer!"

Marquis Meteor thought for a moment and agreed. Controlling the entrance was indeed beneficial! Perhaps the Fate Clan truly foresaw a crisis, but it didn't matter. No matter how dangerous, the other side abandoned the entrance, giving it to them, which was actually a good thing to limit the Fate Clan!

"It's a good thing, but... be careful!"

Marquis Meteor considered and said, "Nomad's Eye of Heaven is not weak, he might have seen something. We three must be cautious!"

"Of course, we won't gamble with our lives!"

Marquis Demon and Marquis Abyss both laughed. Let the Fate Clan leave, they took over this place easily. In previous tides, the Fate Clan had stubbornly defended this place, unwilling to yield!

"Nomad is injured, he probably won't care anymore!"

Marquis Demon laughed again, "This guy might have done it on purpose, injuring himself to avoid participating in the upcoming battles."

"That's normal!"

Marquis Meteor wasn't surprised. Injuring oneself was also a good way to avoid the conflict between both sides.

The three of them didn't leave, staying put. The entrance was more important than the passage above. Controlling this place meant the Fate Clan's comings and goings, or communication, had to go through them, making it more reassuring.

...

"Three powerful beings, two even stronger than Marquis Abyss!"

Su Yu assessed. Marquis Abyss, after all, was an ancient marquis. In Su Yu's estimation, the opponent should be on par with himself. He categorized the Heavenly Kings as first-tier, the Old Turtle and Tiangu as second-tier, the Great Qin King as third-tier, and himself as fourth-tier.

Marquis Abyss was not weaker than him, perhaps even stronger. If the other two were stronger than Marquis Abyss, could they both be third-tier?

That would make them stronger than some ancient clan emperors.

"Two more have descended?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. Previously, he only thought of besieging the Fate Realm, casually fighting to lure some out of the realm. But since there were three big fish... he wanted to take them down!

Catch them by surprise!

The other side didn't know he was aware of the three powerful beings here. If he truly brought the Iron Devourer Emperor and others, they might even be happy!

"If I were Tiangu and the others, seeing me bring several beast emperors to attack... would they come to the rescue immediately? Not necessarily. They know the strength here is formidable, and we can't take it down quickly! During this time, perhaps... it's better to launch a strong attack on the Iron Devourer Realm or the Human Realm!"

"Not only can they force us to retreat, but they can also wound these clans. Anyway, we can't take down the three powerful beings quickly!"

"If the Great Zhou King can hold one, then to suddenly kill the remaining two... we need at least six or seven Daofuse experts to instantly kill them!"

Thoughts flashed one by one.

Previously, he didn't plan to kill Marquis Abyss. Killing one didn't mean much. Moreover, once Marquis Abyss entered the realm, he was a branch of the Fate Clan, not suppressed, making it hard to kill. Su Yu didn't want to enter the realm to kill. However, those two were not from the Fate Clan. They would definitely not want to be restricted in battle and would surely exit the realm!

If they didn't exit, he could bring the Great Zhou King in to kill them. Those two strong beings would probably be suffocated to death!

Thinking of this, Su Yu quickly issued orders, "Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Book Spirit, Tea Plant, go meet with the Great Zhou King!"

He wanted the Great Zhou King to teleport quickly. These five strong beings, working together, could instantly kill a top-tier Daofuse!

Being able to fight the Great Zhou King alone didn't mean they could handle five top-tier experts.

As for Su Yu, he set his sights on Marquis Abyss, while the remaining ones, June and the others, would join forces to deal with one!

Instantly kill the opponent!

In this way, the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King would be exposed. Let them be exposed, kill one or two strong beings first!

The top-tier ones, it's exhilarating to kill them!

"September can guard the Iron Devourer Realm, but the Hou Race and Space Ancient Beast need strong beings to guard, just in case!"

The probability of the opponent attacking was low. Once they acted, Tiangu and the others might not have the chance to attack, but they must be guarded against, to prevent accidents. If allies were in trouble, it would easily cause concern.

If they didn't attack, that would be best, no need to expose.

If they did, then expose one or two.

"Heavendoom, you secretly go to the Hou Race!"

"Grandstar, Empyrean Cloud, you two secretly go to the Space Ancient Beast Realm. Do not act unless Daofuse attacks, do not act!"

Deploy the overt Daofuse, while the covert ones continue to lurk, not exposing until the end.

Even if the opponent truly allowed three Daofuse to die, losing the Fate Realm, it wouldn't matter. They couldn't possibly take down the other realms.

On the Human Clan's side, Wan Tiansheng was defending.

But it might not be enough. Thinking of this, Su Yu also feared the opponent might concentrate their efforts to attack the Human Clan. Quickly, he continued to send messages, "Mountain Initiator, you all go to the Human Realm!"

After sending messages for a while, Su Yu waited silently.

Waiting for dawn!

At dawn, launch a surprise attack!

...

At this moment, in Grand Dream City.

The Great Xia King and the Great Qin King both frowned slightly. The Great Xia King said in a deep voice, "Weren't we supposed to remain hidden? Now if you and I follow Old Zhou, does this mean we're going to be exposed?"

He still wanted to be a trump card!

But Su Yu's intention... wasn't allowing them to be a trump card?

The Great Qin King said in a deep voice, "Perhaps there's been a change! Previously, he gathered many Daofuse, meaning to kill if possible. If Marquis Abyss hides, then breaking the realm is the priority. Now, however, there's a desire to kill... has something changed?"

He wasn't too sure either. Su Yu hadn't explained clearly.

"Never mind, if we can kill, then kill."

The Great Qin King glanced at the Old Turtle and said, "With so many of us returning to the Human Realm, a slight mistake could easily be discovered. Can the large formation on the periphery be moved now?"

In the distance, the Great Ming King was full of excitement, nodding, "It can be moved, but don't break it. I still need to continue studying it!"

The Old Turtle heard this and smiled, "Then I'll move the ancient city to send you to the Eastern Rift Valley!"

"No need!"

The Great Qin King said, "Go to the entrance of the God Devourer Realm. There's a passage there. The God Devourer Race can open it, and we'll enter the Human Realm that way to avoid being spotted!"

"Alright!"

Soon, the ancient city moved.

In an instant, many noticed this side, looking towards Grand Dream City. However, the ancient city stopped at the God Devourer Realm. Some strong beings glanced over, but before their willpower could probe, two large mouths were waiting eagerly, ready to devour anything sent their way.

In an instant, everyone gave up on the idea.

Forget it.

Who knows what the Old Turtle is doing with those two guys!

Let him be. It's not like he wouldn't inform the Human Alliance's Daofuse. Maybe the Old Turtle was just going to chat about life with those two.

Soon, the Great Qin King and the others all left, entering the Human Realm.

Grand Dream City quickly disappeared, returning to its original location.

The time taken for the round trip wasn't long, and others didn't bother to care.

As long as the Old Turtle was still in the city!

If the Old Turtle left, that would be inappropriate.

...

The sky gradually began to brighten.

At this moment, a group of strong beings began preparing to act.

In the Iron Devourer Realm, the Beast Emperor of June took a deep breath, holding a large bamboo, baring his teeth, and said to September, "I'm leaving, take care of the house, be careful. If Tiangu enters the realm, you can still fight him!"

"I know!"

...

In the Hou Realm.

The Hou Emperor stood at the passage entrance, his expression suddenly changing.

"Me, don't make a sound. Su Yu... Emperor, ahem, Emperor Yu said you're worried about leaving and something happening, right? I'm here to help you guard!"

The Hou Emperor was shocked, transmitting, "Heavendoom?"

"It's your grandpa... ahem, forget it, I'm used to saying that. It's me."

"You... reached Daofuse?"

"Nonsense, I beat you one, two, three, shut up. If it weren't for hiding my advancement, how could it be your turn to act? I'd have smashed Marquis Abyss with one strike!"

The Hou Emperor was shocked, and amidst the shock, he was also excited, "Thank you, Emperor Yu, for taking care of us! I was indeed a bit worried, but now... I'm not worried anymore! What about the other realms?"

"Don't worry, we have plenty of trump cards. Wherever they attack, it's a dead end! If it weren't for not wanting casualties, we'd have taken down their lairs long ago. Emperor Yu doesn't want casualties, focusing on attacking the Upper Realm. The Lower Realm is nothing!"

The Hou Emperor fell silent, feeling excited inside.

He was indeed worried that if he left, something might happen in the realm. Unexpectedly, Su Yu had already considered this, and in that moment, all his worries vanished. Su Yu truly had the bearing of a Human Emperor!

...

It wasn't just him; at this moment, the Space Beast Emperor was also deeply moved. Two figures had arrived on his side: Grandstar and Empyrean Cloud.

The Space Beast Emperor transmitted a message, "You two... this time, I'm counting on you. Enter the realm first. As long as the enemy doesn't invade the realm, there's no need to reveal your identities! As for outside the realm, causing some destruction isn't a big deal!"

In an instant, the Space Beast Emperor was filled with joy. Each ancient clan secretly had Daofuse experts guarding them. This meant that Su Yu's side had an unimaginable number of Daofuse experts! After all, the Human Realm still needed to be defended. Perhaps there were even more over there! Just how many had advanced to Daofuse?

...

At this moment, all the races were exchanging Daofuse experts. Su Yu was even prepared that if those fools decided to split up and attack each realm separately, he would seize the opportunity to devour them! Of course, if they joined forces, then so be it. Defense would be the priority!

...

The sky gradually brightened. Brighter and brighter!

At the entrance of the Fate Realm, three great experts stood. At this moment, Marquis Falling Star felt a vague sense of unease. The Fate Emperor had fled, leaving him uneasy. Could it be... something was really going to happen? It shouldn't be this soon, right?

He took a deep breath and stood up, saying, "Modang, let's move a bit outside the realm. If we get blocked at the entrance, we'll be in danger. Staying at the realm's passageway allows us to exit at any time!"

Modang nodded. He had long wanted to go to the entrance, feeling safer there!

The two quickly reached the entrance, while Marquis Abyss remained where he was, indifferent to his location.

And at that moment, the sky officially brightened. The entire Allheaven Battlefield transformed from its previous dimness to a starlit brilliance. The daytime of the Allheaven Battlefield was like this, quite bright, with a gentle starlight instantly illuminating the Fate Realm.

Simultaneously, beams of light from all directions, moving at incredible speed, rushed towards the Fate Realm! Astonishingly fast! As fast as could be!

At the same time, in the Human Realm, the Great Zhou King's character activated, causing the void to tremble, instantly transporting people towards the Fate Realm!

All at the same time, perfectly synchronized!

The attack on the Fate Realm!

Several Beast Emperors were filled with passion and excitement, not having felt this way in years. They had no fear because they had a retreat, no worries!

Their realm had powerful guardians!

And at this moment, two members of the God Devourer Ancient Clan headed straight for the Immortal Realm, while Old Turtle went directly to the Devil Realm to suppress Tiangu and the others. If they could fight their way out, then so be it. If not, they would intercept them! Let the strong clans like the Nether, Phoenix, and Ape send reinforcements!

In the Immortal Realm, the aura fluctuated. Tiangu was initially shocked, but upon sensing all the auras heading towards the Fate Realm, he suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. Scared me to death! I thought they were attacking the Dragon Realm, which would have been a huge problem. Who would have thought Su Yu would choose to attack the Fate Realm?

"Bad luck for you!"

Tiangu laughed. The Fate Realm, even if the Lifeless Emperor didn't intervene, had three top-tier Daofuse experts. Su Yu's forces would still need to intercept him and his allies, which wouldn't be enough!

"Marquis Falling Star and the others aren't weak!"

Tiangu chuckled but still prepared to assist, just in case the humans really succeeded in their siege.

"King of Runes, make your move!"

Tiangu, along with the King of Runes, instantly charged towards the two God Devourer Clan members! Bold, but doomed to fail. The only worry was that Marquis Falling Star and the others might be exposed. While the danger wasn't great, exposing these two would be problematic.

"Forget it, if they're exposed, then so be it!"

Tiangu was helpless; there was no other choice. Su Yu and his group were too audacious. Fortunately, he had been wise and prepared in advance, sending two top-tier Daofuse experts to the lower realm. Otherwise, this would have been difficult to handle. Indeed, his instincts were correct; Su Yu was not one to remain idle!
