Chapter 817: Su Yu Battles Hundred Battle King

"You've been plotting for many years..."

Su Yu sighed, "I didn't expect that you had started planning so early. Is your claim about guiding the Human Ancestor true or false? Why do you want to open the Gate of Hell?"

Is it really that simple?

Su Yu continued, "Did you know from the beginning, or was it because of Zhou Ji's appearance that you learned everything and chose to betray?"

"Hundred Battle King... you could have become the strongest Human Lord, the successor of the Human Emperor. Why are you so stubborn?"

Su Yu murmured, "In your eyes, is the Human Emperor inferior to the Human Ancestor?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Why do I feel that the Human Emperor is even more formidable than the Human Ancestor!"

In Su Yu's view, the Human Emperor might not seem reliable... well, actually, he is quite reliable. Although Su Yu hasn't inherited the Human Emperor's path of responsibility, in his eyes, the Human Emperor is a person of great charisma and capability.

A true warrior achieves without boasting!

In ancient times, the Human Emperor's fame was not as great as the Culture King's, yet the Culture King respected him, and so did the Martial King... all the ancient powerhouses respected him.

In times of crisis, the Human Emperor quickly stood up and quelled the turmoil.

Perhaps, in the Human Emperor's eyes, he could return soon.

After he left, the Human Race could rise quickly.

But... what a pitfall!

Su Yu felt that the Human Emperor's life was tragic. At his peak, he was tricked by the Culture King, the Martial King, and at the last moment, by the Control King and people like Hundred Battle King, and even the Great Zhou King was a pitfall!

Despite all these pitfalls, he hasn't died yet. With so many pig teammates, one has to admit, the Human Emperor is amazing!

Anyone else would have been dead long ago!

It's incredible that he has survived until now.

"The Human Emperor?"

Hundred Battle King didn't seem too anxious, and he chuckled softly, "The Human Emperor is very strong, very charismatic, and even created his own world. Who dares to say the Human Emperor isn't strong?"

Su Yu's heart trembled slightly!

Hundred Battle King knows!

He knows the Human Emperor created a world!

Hundred Battle King laughed again, "Not only is the Human Emperor strong, but the Culture King is also strong. These people are all very powerful! But... if I say the Human Ancestor is stronger, you might find it unbelievable... yet it's true!"

With a smile, he continued, "Do you know what the Human Ancestor's most glorious achievement was?"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Tell me."

"Dealing with the Lord of the Dead!"

Hundred Battle King said slowly, "The disappearance of the Lord of the Dead wasn't because he vanished on his own, but because the Human Ancestor's presence forced him to disappear... does that make sense to you?"

"In today's world, the Master of Time might be the number one, and you might think the Lord of the Dead is the second... but in reality, the Human Ancestor is not weaker than the Lord of the Dead, perhaps even stronger!"

Hundred Battle King sighed, "You all think you're right! You're wrong! The Human Emperor created a world, but what kind of world? A chaotic, weak world! As for you, Su Yu..."

Hundred Battle King laughed, "Do you think your trump card is your world?"

Su Yu's eyes narrowed slightly.

"Why do you all like to underestimate the world?"

Hundred Battle King murmured, "You are like this, and the Human Emperor is actually like this too. He also thought he could solve all the troubles! But in reality... Su Yu, do you think you can surpass the Human Emperor? Surpass the Lord of the Dead? Surpass the Master of Time? Even the Lord of the Dead couldn't match the Human Ancestor, and the Human Ancestor couldn't solve these problems... only time can grind everything down... what makes you think you can do it?"

At this moment, Su Yu's heart was also in turmoil.

Hundred Battle King... is he in despair?

Perhaps, he once wanted to rise, to strive, but... it seems he is in despair.

Is the Human Emperor strong?

Su Yu thought he didn't know the Human Emperor created a world, but Hundred Battle King knew.

Not only did he know, but Hundred Battle King also knew some secrets that Su Yu didn't, such as the possibility that the Human Ancestor once defeated the Lord of the Dead!

This is shocking news!

In Su Yu's eyes, the Human Ancestor's path was strong, the path of the physical body, terrifyingly strong, but no matter how strong, Su Yu thought it should not be stronger than the Human Emperor. But according to Hundred Battle King's words, the Human Ancestor was definitely stronger than the Human Emperor.

After all, the Lord of the Dead is definitely stronger than the Human Emperor!

So, the Human Ancestor... might have created a world too!

Is that so?

Just like the Culture King, everyone thought he mastered the pen dao, but he had long abandoned it and created his own world, just that Su Yu didn't know where it was.

One thought after another surfaced in Su Yu's mind.

Moreover, Hundred Battle King also knew he had created a world. Thinking of this, Su Yu said softly, "Did Thunderstorm tell you?"

"Thunderstorm?"

Hundred Battle King laughed, "Is that necessary? No need! Su Yu, don't think you're the only genius, the only wise one! When I saw you emerge from the Death Realm, I understood!"

"Do you think only the Heaven Gate can observe everything?"

Hundred Battle King laughed, "I didn't open the Heaven Gate, I opened the Human Gate!"

Human Gate!

Su Yu was shocked, what does that mean?

A small portal appeared on Hundred Battle King's forehead, slightly different from Su Yu's portal. Hundred Battle King said softly, "The Heaven Gate requires opening 720 acupoints to activate! Too complicated! The Human Gate is much simpler. The Human Race's development of the physical body is too shallow. When you develop the physical body to the extreme, you'll find some things aren't that difficult... like the Human Gate!"

Su Yu frowned, "Human Gate... Heaven Gate... Gate of Hell... Heaven, Earth, and Human Gates?"

Su Yu frowned, "Then that's not right, does that mean the Earth Gate comes first, and the Heaven Gate comes later?"

Some things aren't just names; they have special meanings. For example, according to Hundred Battle King's words, there's also a Human Gate, so how can the Heaven Gate come after the Earth Gate?

The Earth Gate seals chaos, while the Heaven Gate seals the era of creation?

Strange!

Hundred Battle King laughed, "It doesn't have to be in chronological order... isn't it better to rank by strength? It's simple, the existence within the Heaven Gate is stronger... so naturally, it's called the Heaven Gate! For example... the Master of Time!"

Su Yu's heart stirred!

"The Master of Time is really within the Heaven Gate? Then what about the Lord of the Dead?"

"Maybe there too!"

Hundred Battle King said softly, "Who knows, maybe there, maybe not, what does it have to do with you?"

Hundred Battle King sighed, "Su Yu, knowing too much isn't necessarily a good thing! When you know too much, don't you feel despair?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and shook his head, "No, knowing more makes me excited!"

Su Yu said excitedly, "For example, knowing that you know so much makes me want to kill you and devour your memories to see how much you know. Do you think I'm a bit perverted?"

Su Yu was extremely excited, "I just love the feeling of stripping others bare, seeing through everything! I love the thrill of having everything under control, of knowing everything!"

Su Yu laughed maniacally, "You don't understand, that feeling is simply exhilarating! For example, you don't know who your father is, but I do. I reveal it to you, and you're dumbfounded, 'Oh, my father is him... Su Yu is amazing, he actually knows who my father is!'"

"That's the feeling!"

Su Yu laughed somewhat crazily, "So... what you call despair, I want to try it! In my life, if I ever felt despair, it was only once. After that, I told myself never to despair again, never to rely on others, to rely on oneself, to strive for everything!"

Su Yu pointed into the distance, pointing towards the Human Realm, and laughed, "Just a few years ago! Right there! My teacher was besieged, my elders, my friends... they were besieged over there! I shouted, save them... I begged everyone, I took out my most precious treasures, my secrets, things people thought I shouldn't have... I took them all out..."

"That day, I was in despair!"

"No one was willing to help me!"

Su Yu's smile was radiant, "Hundred Battle King, have you ever experienced that kind of despair? Your family and friends, besieged before your eyes! You beg for help, but no one listens, no one is willing to help you... I was young then, I had just started practicing martial arts, I was only 18... though I'm not much older now, I've experienced so much!"

Su Yu's smile grew brighter, "From that day on, I knew everything could only rely on myself! I found my own backers, my own protection, everything was found by myself. I no longer hoped these things would come to me because... I didn't need them anymore!"

"When I was weak, I called everyone grandpa, ancestor, master, mistress... Hundred Battle King, you probably haven't experienced all this. If you had, you'd understand... what's the point?"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "What ancient secrets, what ancient legends, what Human Ancestor, Human Emperor... are they more reliable than oneself? If I have the ability, I can get everything. If you don't give it to me, I'll beat you to death! It's that simple!"

"You, a sheltered guy, probably don't understand!"

Su Yu shook his head, "What a pity! Yes, I heard you had great talent from a young age, treasured by the ancient elders! You haven't experienced all this, you haven't experienced that kind of despair! So, your so-called despair... is laughable to me!"

Su Yu laughed, full of mockery, "Yes, how could those from previous tides understand? You, who were protected from a young age, how could you understand? Do you know, as a weak Source Opening Realm cultivator, the feeling of having to kill to seize merit points for a drop of Great Strength Realm iron-winged bird blood essence?"

"I’m eighteen, at the Source Opening Realm... You probably don’t even know what Source Opening is! For someone like you, maybe you were born with nine apertures open, or perhaps you reached the Great Strength Realm in a single day... You probably don’t know what Source Opening is... I was just a guy who only knew how to write, and for the first time, in the academy, I used my hands to beat a Myriad Race Cult follower to death... That feeling, it’s different!"

Su Yu's smile grew even brighter. "To me, do you think the secrets you speak of are despairing? How laughable!"

Hundred Battle's smile gradually faded as he looked at Su Yu. Perhaps this was the first time he had truly delved into understanding Su Yu.

At eighteen, from a mere student who only knew how to study, he killed for the first time, all for a bit of merit, to exchange for a drop of blood essence, a blood essence so weak it was negligible. His teacher was besieged, and he shouted, roared, and begged... yet no one came to help him.

Despair?

It must have been despairing!

Hundred Battle didn’t understand, because as Su Yu said, he had never experienced such a scene. He was extraordinarily gifted and had been protected by countless old antiques since he was very young!

As Su Yu spoke of these things, Hundred Battle fell silent.

Su Yu laughed again, "Have you been stalling for time, waiting for news? Waiting for the Martial Emperor to truly be taken away, led away by Zhou Ji, is that it?"

Hundred Battle raised an eyebrow slightly.

Su Yu chuckled, "Rest assured, that idiot Martial Emperor, to be honest, his intelligence isn’t high! He’s probably really been led away!"

Hundred Battle raised his eyebrow again, "Su Yu, you’re very confident! Is it because you’ve opened the Heaven?"

"Opening the Heaven... indeed, it’s extraordinary, remarkable! But you, your Heaven Opening is too short-lived!"

Hundred Battle sighed, "I originally thought you would have the Martial Emperor deal with me, or you would lure me into the depths of chaos, into your world, but I found... you didn’t do any of that!"

He was surprised, "Are you too confident?"

With a hint of a smile, "Confident enough to think you can really deal with me?"

"Why not?"

Su Yu also smiled, "Hundred Battle, do you know what the biggest difference between you and me is?"

"I’d love to hear it!"

"I... am rather shameless... If I can’t deal with you... I’ll run!"

Hundred Battle was slightly taken aback, and Su Yu had already disappeared in an instant.

Hundred Battle's face stiffened!

It was Su Yu who had actively forced him, actively sealed the lower realm, and as a result, after chatting for a while, Su Yu actually ran away!

What was this?

Hundred Battle's face turned slightly unsightly, and soon, a portal appeared on his forehead, and with a casual punch, this punch seemed random, yet it blasted out tens of thousands of miles, shattering the void in the distance!

Su Yu's figure suddenly appeared.

With some seriousness, looking at Hundred Battle, Su Yu frowned and said, "Are you going to cling to me? We just talked, and you really want to fight?"

Just talked?

Did you really think this was a joke?

Hundred Battle's face was slightly unsightly, "Su Yu, you are at least a Human Lord!"

Su Yu grinned cheekily, "Really? If you commit suicide, I’ll even call you dad! Hundred Battle, you were taught that you’re an emperor, and should have the demeanor of an emperor... but... I never learned the art of kingship, sorry!"

What is demeanor?

I don’t know!

Hundred Battle and these people are still traditional emperors, instilled with certain concepts from a young age, some habits are actually unchangeable.

The difference between the grassroots and the nobility!

Face... Su Yu really treats it like dog shit, using it to decorate when needed, and when not needed, what is it worth?

With that, Su Yu's figure disappeared again!

Hundred Battle watched coldly, can you run?

Since you came, don’t run!

"Chase!"

With a low shout from Hundred Battle, Long Mei, Long Qing, and these people no longer had any flattering expressions, all becoming extremely solemn, disappearing in an instant.

Su Yu can’t escape!

And Hundred Battle, always locking onto Su Yu, run?

You can’t escape!

His Heaven Gate has always locked onto Su Yu, does Su Yu want to escape to chaos, to his world?

Is it possible?

Hundred Battle stepped through the air, tearing through the void, moving extremely fast!

In an instant, he appeared in one direction, and Su Yu, however, had not yet arrived.

However, Su Yu quickly changed direction, continuing to flee.

Hundred Battle frowned, "Since you sealed the lower realm, isn’t it to have a life-and-death battle with me? Su Yu, if you keep running, I’ll go to the Upper Realm and kill your people!"

The Upper Realm, he can go there too!

If Su Yu keeps running, he’ll go kill people!

Su Yu grinned, "Go ahead!"

Hundred Battle was taken aback!

Su Yu chuckled, "Go kill! My father, my teacher, my friends, I’ve hidden them all, the others... ahem, are all subordinates, killing subordinates, I don’t care! If you find my dad and kill him, I’ll surrender! Otherwise, go kill, kill them all, just right, I’ll hide every day and kill your whole family... Haha, threatening me with this? What a joke!"

Su Yu looked smug, "If it really doesn’t work, you kill them all, I’ll go upstream in the River of Time, go find the Human Emperor and them, anyway, I have no attachments, running away is normal, grandson, if you don’t kill, you’re not Hundred Battle! Fool, still using this to threaten me? Am I afraid of this?"

"......"

Hundred Battle's face was cold, "So what you said, for the human race, for the greater good, is all fake?"

"It’s not!"

Su Yu laughed while fleeing, "This is called limitedly achieving the world! When I can’t beat you, can’t fight you, I’ll just preserve myself! I studied well, I understand this phrase particularly well! If I can kill you, I’ll achieve the world, if I can’t... then I’ll preserve myself! Is this hard to understand? Reading, you have to read it alive, don’t read dead books, little Hundred Battle, you’re still too tender, taught to waste by old antiques!"

Hundred Battle laughed, "What a tender one, Su Yu, it seems, you are indeed difficult to deal with!"

Threats, don’t work!

Hundred Battle was actually thinking, if he really went to the Upper Realm to kill people, would Su Yu ignore it?

Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn’t.

But it’s just talk!

How could he leave now to kill those people?

Since Su Yu is blocked in the lower realm...

Just finished speaking, Su Yu suddenly opened a necromancy passage, smiling, "Little Hundred Battle, goodbye, I’m going to the Death Realm! By the way, I recorded your betrayal of the human race, it seems, soon, you’ll become the public enemy of the human race!"

Hundred Battle's face changed slightly, "Want to leave?"

He suddenly punched out, not only that, at the same time, a portal suddenly appeared between heaven and earth, the portal on Hundred Battle's forehead, as soon as this Heaven Gate appeared, Hundred Battle shouted, "Seal!"

Boom!

The Heaven Gate sat in the world, in an instant, an incomparably powerful force permeated all directions, the necromancy passage Su Yu just opened was suddenly cut off!

Su Yu was stunned, Hundred Battle said coldly, "Su Yu, did you really think you’re the smartest person in the world? I don’t know you can open the Death Realm?"

Su Yu inhaled, "It’s over, I’m going to die! Hundred Battle, I surrender, do the previous words still count? I surrender, we coexist peacefully, you play yours, I play mine, what do you think?"

"Too late!"

Hundred Battle broke through the air, his Heaven Gate, indeed powerful, Su Yu tried to open the Death Realm passage again, but really couldn’t, Su Yu inhaled again, "Don’t, Brother Hundred Battle, let’s talk... The Myriad Realms are so big, if you really fight me, I can still run, it’s not appropriate!"

Su Yu's shamelessness refreshed Hundred Battle's lower limit!

Maybe Su Yu was right, compared to him, he’s indeed not as shameless!

In front, he was a beast, in the blink of an eye, he’s Brother Hundred Battle!

Such shamelessness, Hundred Battle indeed couldn’t match.

"Su Yu, you can try, see how long you can run!"

At this moment, suddenly, a large net appeared between heaven and earth, Long Qing and Long Mei, along with those Daofuse experts, at some point, wove a large net in the sky, a net of rules!

This large net, instantly fell towards Su Yu!

Long Mei and these people, their aura also exploded to the extreme!

In front, Hundred Battle chased, and here, these people did not disperse, but came together to besiege Su Yu, obviously knowing Su Yu was difficult to deal with, to prevent being broken one by one!

"You dare to bully me too?"

Su Yu frowned, with a cold shout, the next moment, he slashed upwards with a blade!

Long Mei and these people, their faces cold and solemn.

Just about to take it head-on, Hundred Battle suddenly shouted, "Left three!"

A group of people changed color, quickly shifting the net three points to the left, and at this moment, Su Yu's blade aura dissipated, and he himself appeared below the net’s coverage!

Su Yu was suddenly trapped, instantly retreating, couldn’t help but curse, "This is too much! Still commanding! Can’t we fight fairly? Can’t we have a one-on-one? Hundred Battle, you have no kingly demeanor at all!"

Hundred Battle looked at him coldly, quickly chasing, at this point, Su Yu was still talking about kingly demeanor with him, didn’t he feel shameless?

"Tear!"

With a low shout, Hundred Battle punched again, the void suddenly cracked, splitting open out of thin air!

It seemed to be cutting space!

Su Yu here, in the blink of an eye, felt separated from the four directions of heaven and earth, inhaled again, "What’s this, aren’t you a physical path? You’re playing with space path too?"

"When the body is strong, everything is naturally different!"

Hundred Battle walked towards him step by step, "I said, you don’t understand the physical body!"

At this moment, suddenly, Hundred Battle's body flashed, one by one, light points appeared, each light point, shining brightly, incomparably powerful, those were apertures.

And Su Yu, was suddenly shocked, "You... aren’t human? No... you actually have 720 physical apertures!"

This is impossible!

Whether human or myriad races, at most there are 360 apertures, Hundred Battle actually isn’t, he actually has 720 apertures!

Reaching Su Yu's level, he couldn’t possibly not discover hidden physical apertures!

And the positions of Hundred Battle's apertures, Su Yu had seen, he had no apertures there, even hidden ones were impossible!

Hundred Battle said indifferently, "So, the power of the Human Ancestor, you can’t imagine! Your so-called human race, is just the human race in your eyes, the true human race, who said there are no 720 physical apertures?"

Su Yu bared his teeth, "Wait, are you saying we're not actually from the same race? Even though we look alike, you're just wearing human skin, a fake human!"

"You’re wrong. You’re the pseudo-human race!" Bai Zhan's body flickered with apertures, each one a world unto itself. From these apertures, figures emerged, all of them Bai Zhan.

Bai Zhan coldly stated, "People say the myriad races have racial abilities, but humans don't. You're wrong again! Just because you don't have them doesn't mean we don't! Su Yu, the human race's racial abilities are beyond your imagination! Don’t think that just because you’ve opened the heavens, you’re invincible!"

In an instant, a Bai Zhan appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, traversing the void! Meanwhile, the real Bai Zhan teleported, switching places with the phantom, and launched a punch at Su Yu!

Su Yu retreated once more, but another Bai Zhan phantom appeared, this time wielding a binding technique!

Bai Zhan said indifferently, "An aperture, a martial skill; an aperture, a racial ability! Su Yu, you truly don't understand the human race!"

This time, Su Yu was genuinely more serious.

"An aperture, a combat skill... I heard about this years ago, and I know it. I’ve done it before, an aperture, a martial skill... but it’s not the same as yours!"

"Of course not, because... do you even count as human?"

Bai Zhan punched through the void, but Su Yu instantly transformed into a shadow, dissipating from his original spot. Yet, at that moment, the Heaven Gate in the sky suddenly emitted a beam of light!

Boom!

The void exploded!

And on that portal, Su Yu's image appeared, transforming into a breeze, lurking around. Bai Zhan followed the projection on the portal and punched again!

With a loud bang!

Su Yu fell out of his breeze form!

Bai Zhan remained indifferent, "You always think the path of the physical body is for brutes, for fools who only know how to use their fists! You’re right, I do only use my fists, and that’s my forte! But that doesn’t mean I can’t do other things; I just choose not to!"

720 apertures, 720 combat skills, 720 racial abilities, plus the Heaven Gate lock!

Bai Zhan was not just a simple physical cultivator; he was a powerful, multi-talented genius!

Su Yu's lips bled slightly, his expression serious, "Wow, you're almost catching up to me! I only know a few thousand racial abilities, and you’ve mastered 720. Bai Zhan, you're really rising up!"

Suddenly, Su Yu laughed, "Let’s play and see who’s better at it!"

In an instant, he transformed into flames, the burning sky flames rising, drying up the Sea of Stars, revealing the seabed in a flash!

Bai Zhan sneered, throwing a punch that summoned wind and rain, extinguishing the flames instantly. Another punch sent torrents of water slicing through the void!

Su Yu quickly retreated, barely escaping before the void shattered, the water streams more dangerous than sharp swords.

Su Yu grimaced, "Impressive... Brother Bai Zhan, I surrender, okay?"

"Shameless scoundrel!"

Bai Zhan snorted, dissatisfied. Su Yu wasn’t weak, but he avoided direct confrontation, relying on various means to evade him!

"Seal him!"

Bai Zhan commanded, and from above, Chang Mei and others swiftly cast a massive net!

It descended upon Su Yu!

This net was formidable!

Set by two Heavenly Venerables, multiple Heavenly Kings, and over a dozen Daofuse cultivators.

Bai Zhan spoke coldly, "Originally prepared for the Martial Emperor, but since you insist on stepping forward... it’s yours!"

"Such words..."

Su Yu suddenly chuckled, and in the eyes of Chang Mei and the others, he suddenly transformed into Bai Zhan. In an instant, he tangled with Bai Zhan, and in the blink of an eye, the two separated!

Then... Chang Mei and the others were stunned!

Who was Bai Zhan?

Bai Zhan shouted coldly, "Tricks of the trade, Heaven Gate lock!"

As he spoke, the Heaven Gate trembled, shooting a golden light at Su Yu!

Pretending to be me?

Ridiculous!

Chang Mei and the others were startled, hastily casting the net towards Su Yu, but this Su Yu suddenly shouted angrily, "Bastard!"

As he spoke, he reached out and shattered the illusory Heaven Gate into pieces, angrily saying, "He’s Su Yu!"

Opposite, the "Bai Zhan" who had just controlled the Heaven Gate, well, he was Su Yu, also shouted angrily, "Bastard, how dare you use illusions?"

Bai Zhan was furious!

720 apertures erupted with dazzling light, and on Su Yu's side, 720 apertures also appeared. No kidding, I can fake it too!

What a joke!

Anything Bai Zhan could do, was there anything I couldn’t?

Now, Chang Mei and the others were truly confused.

They couldn’t see through it!

Really!

Both were too strong, they couldn’t discern who was who, without the Heaven Gate, without the Heaven Gate, without the Earth Gate, how could they tell the real from the fake?

Who should they cover?

If they got it wrong and covered the real one, the fake might seize the opportunity to deliver a heavy blow to the real one!

They absolutely couldn’t get it wrong!

Su Yu was too cunning, and just now, when he disguised himself, he even actively manipulated the Heaven Gate... Chang Mei and the others really didn’t know who was real and who was fake!

...

Bai Zhan was furious!

He hadn’t expected Su Yu to be so shameless, actually disguising himself as him!

The key was, Su Yu... disguised himself so well!

Because Su Yu had many means, strong strength, many combat skills, and mastered many daos, his disguise was almost flawless.

Of course, Bai Zhan still had a way. The next moment, he shouted, "Chang Mei, taste the hundred wines in the clouds..."

In the air, Chang Mei trembled, quickly shouting, "This one is real!"

Everyone hurriedly controlled the net, covering Su Yu!

Su Yu was startled, a secret code, I don’t know it!

The next moment, he shouted, "Chang Qing, let’s have a heart-to-heart talk on the couch..."

Chang Qing was stunned, what nonsense?

But the others were also stunned, could this one be the real one?

They looked at Chang Qing, whose expression changed, and then, the previous Su Yu disappeared, once again entangled with the previous Bai Zhan!

A group of people almost spat blood!

Done!

Mixed up again!

Now, how to distinguish?

A group of people held the net of rules and daos, but didn’t know who to cover, and the real Bai Zhan shouted angrily, "Cover them both, envelop them together!"

Sooner or later, they could tell the real from the fake!

But Su Yu shouted angrily, "No, he wants to use my power to break the seal. If we join forces and break the seal, you’ll all be seriously injured!"

Makes sense!

Now, Chang Mei and the others hesitated again!

Bai Zhan was really about to explode with anger!

He hadn’t expected Su Yu to be so shameless!

His brow moved, the Heaven Gate appeared again, and opposite, Su Yu’s Heaven Gate appeared, looking exactly the same!

Su Yu took the initiative, shouting, "Reveal yourself!"

On his Heaven Gate, Bai Zhan’s image appeared, but quickly transformed into Su Yu, into his own image. Su Yu shouted angrily, "Reveal yourself!"

Idiot!

He was sure Bai Zhan wouldn’t tell his subordinates the functions of the Heaven Gate. What functions it had, wasn’t it up to me to make up?

Who would tell their subordinates everything about themselves?

Wouldn’t that be idiotic?

Especially someone like Bai Zhan!

Sure enough, Chang Mei and the others trembled, this one was real, the other was fake!

And the real Bai Zhan was really about to vomit blood!

Yes, Su Yu guessed right, Chang Mei and the others didn’t know the specific functions of the Heaven Gate at all.

The next moment, Bai Zhan shouted angrily, "I am the path of the physical body, his physical body isn’t as strong as mine. Su Yu, come, let’s duel with our physical bodies. If you’re Bai Zhan, don’t you want to prove yourself?"

The two weren’t unable to defeat Chang Qing and the others, that was impossible.

But the two were always entangled, and with this net, it was easy for one side to fall into a passive position!

Moreover, for Bai Zhan, Chang Qing and the others were his own people, his own people attacking him... that was too pitiful, it would make him vomit blood!

Su Yu cursed inwardly, that’s true, my physical body isn’t as strong as this guy’s!

Some of Bai Zhan’s racial abilities, the Heaven Gate, he could mimic or fake, but the strength of the physical body couldn’t be faked. In a real fight, Bai Zhan’s physical body was strong, and Su Yu definitely couldn’t match him.

Of course, losing face but not losing ground, Su Yu shouted coldly, "Su Yu, you’re seeking death, bluffing!"

As he spoke, he charged at Bai Zhan, and during the charge, an illusion appeared.

Everyone saw the real Bai Zhan being torn apart... and the real Bai Zhan was furious, his blood qi erupted, instantly shattering the illusion!

Su Yu, shameless!

He actually relied on creating illusions to deceive Chang Qing and the others!

At this point, Bai Zhan couldn’t hold back anymore, shouting, "You all back off, don’t interfere, this king will personally kill him!"

These people’s presence was actually interfering with him!

It would be better if they left!

But Su Yu shouted, "Don’t fall for it!"

Above, Chang Qing and the others were about to go crazy!

What should they do?

Should they retreat or not?

Bai Zhan was also extremely angry, shouting, "Chang Qing, six thousand years ago, I told you, when I return, I will surpass the ancients... retreat!"

Chang Qing’s expression changed, shouting, "Retreat!"

In an instant, the group quickly retreated!

Seeing this, Su Yu had no choice but to revert to his original form, sighing, "I can’t fake that, really shameless, you even surpass the ancients, I’m disgusted, sorry, I really can’t say such disgusting words!"

"......"

Bai Zhan was a bit angry, "Su Yu, is this all you dare to do?"

Su Yu was speechless, "You brought people to surround and kill me, and you’re scolding me for only daring to do this? You double-standard dog, you won’t die a good death!"

"......"

Bai Zhan punched, flames burning the sky!

I’ll kill you first!

And Su Yu... once again began his escape journey, fleeing swiftly, screaming, "Stop fighting, I surrender!"

The more Bai Zhan chased, the more serious he became, "What exactly are you trying to do? Why are you stalling for time?"

Su Yu was stalling for time!

Yes, he was sure now, Su Yu was stalling for time, this guy was strong, from his fight with him, he fled smoothly, not at all like someone about to be killed by him!

Su Yu was stronger than expected!

Su Yu suddenly halted, his expression turning serious as he turned his head. "You actually figured it out!"

Hundred Battle was taken aback, but Su Yu quickly broke into a mischievous grin. "Screw you, you idiot! You only just realized it now? Damn, I thought you had figured it out from the start. This is hilarious!"

"Su Yu!" A furious shout echoed across the heavens and earth.

Hundred Battle realized that Su Yu was truly infuriating, capable of driving someone mad without taking any responsibility.

"Hahaha!"
