Chapter 684: The Great Treasure!

The Myriad Realms had been quiet for some time now, over three months. Only Su Yu’s previous attack on Jian Tian Hou had caused a ripple.

In reality, three months, in the past, was merely the blink of an eye.

But now, the myriad races were quite satisfied.

Apart from the minor realms in the Eastern War Zone, which were in dire straits, other races desperately wished for no major disturbances. A large number of Eternals had died, and many Daofuse experts had perished. These minor races now dared not get involved in such large-scale wars.

The Allheaven Battlefield’s popularity had recovered slightly compared to before.

Life had to go on.

The Allheaven Battlefield was rich in source qi and had more treasures. They couldn’t just sit idly in their minor realms, consuming their resources.

Now, the Human Race was primarily attacking the minor realms in the east, almost completely flattening the entire Eastern War Zone!

While chaotic, the Eastern War Zone had also become much livelier.

Some minor races that chose to surrender now dared to emerge. The Human Race held an advantage in the Allheaven Battlefield, which was actually a good thing for the surrendered races. As for their higher-ups being suppressed, that was their leaders’ problem.

Yu Hai Ping Yuan.

One could now see figures of various races there.

The Ancient City still stood.

It had merely changed owners, but to others, it made no difference. In fact, they couldn’t even sense it. There were still powerful experts stationed there, also Eternals. The specific stages of cultivation were meaningless to the weak.

Heavendoom Ancient City.

It had always stood on Yu Hai Ping Yuan, near the edge of the Sea of Stars.

At this moment, the Ancient City had also regained some vitality.

There were more people than before; it was no longer lifeless.

Throughout the Ancient City, the death qi was actually much less than before, mainly because the blocking monarchs of the Death Realm had all disappeared.

The day after Su Yu contacted the experts of various races.

Several figures appeared at the gate of Heavendoom Ancient City.

Three men and one woman, all humanoid beings.

Heavendoom Ancient City was currently guarded by Zhou Polong. Additionally, Tianhe City Lord was still within the city, but he wasn’t managing affairs much now. Heavendoom had left, and he knew that he and Zhou Polong were supervising each other to prevent any leaks.

At the city gate.

A Sunmoon Realm general was still guarding the gate, the Tianmen General whom Su Yu was familiar with.

At this moment, Tianmen General glanced at the four figures, seeing nothing unusual.

They all seemed to be human.

Currently, Human Race experts were spread throughout the Allheaven Battlefield, seeking opportunities, invading minor realms, seizing resources, and exploring the Sea of Stars. Since the Ancient City was under Su Yu’s command, many humans came and went.

Half of the city’s population was human.

A few humans arriving was not surprising.

The four individuals all seemed to be in the Mountain Sea Realm, their strength not particularly eye-catching.

The group entered, not through the main gate, but a side gate. Tianmen General merely swept his gaze over them, not paying much attention.

“A bit new…”

Just then, Tianmen General’s ears twitched slightly. A bit new?

Were they talking about the Ancient City?

The Ancient City hadn’t changed much; the buildings remained the same. Only the core defensive weapon had been replaced. Most people weren’t aware of the specifics, and Tianmen General wasn’t entirely clear either, but having guarded the city gate for many years, he had a certain feeling.

The current Ancient City felt less dangerous and less oppressive than before.

It indeed felt like it was missing some of its former intensity!

Of course, this was a conclusion he had reached after guarding this place for hundreds of years.

Tianmen General didn’t ask or interfere. This was a matter for the higher-ups. Perhaps it was related to Su Yu, and he knew better than to ask what he shouldn’t.

Among the group that had just entered, one person said, “A bit new,” while the other three remained silent, continuing to walk into the Ancient City as before.

Tianmen turned his head to look. The four weren’t walking fast, as if it was their first time entering the Ancient City, yet also not. Their demeanor suggested a reunion after a long separation, a lack of familiarity, but also an awareness of how the place used to be.

Tianmen looked a few more times, but found nothing unusual.

He frowned slightly, wondering if he was being overly suspicious.

It was just a casual remark.

He himself didn’t know the situation, let alone outsiders.

He turned back, no longer paying attention. At this moment, the figures behind him seemed to sense something. One of them looked back at Tianmen, said nothing, and quickly turned their head, continuing forward.

On the city wall, Tianmen General frowned slightly. Was that person just looking at me?

How sharp!

After a slight hesitation, Tianmen General still moved his city gate token. Something felt off, though he couldn’t pinpoint what. It just felt wrong.

Forget it, let the City Lord take a look.

He sent a message to Tianhe and quickly dismissed the matter.

…

Inside the City Lord’s Mansion.

Tianhe had been living quite leisurely these days. Heavendoom was gone, and the newcomer, Zhou Polong, was quite polite to him, not as overbearing as Heavendoom, who would constantly scold him for being useless.

He was also familiar with this new guardian, Zhou Polong; he had known him before.

However, Zhou Polong’s seniority was too low, so Tianhe wasn’t too afraid of him.

Now, with neither bothering the other, things were good.

He would drink tea and read books in his free time. His desire to achieve Daofuse had even faded considerably. As a Quasi-Invincible Realm expert, he had been cultivating his mind and body recently, feeling that not achieving Daofuse wasn’t such a big deal.

As he was drinking tea and reading, his Vice City Lord token vibrated.

He sensed it and cursed inwardly. Tianmen was being nosy.

Such a trivial matter, and he had to bother him.

People came and went in this Ancient City all day, every day.

It was just a few Mountain Sea Realm cultivators!

Not a few Eternals!

Zhou Polong hadn’t said anything, yet Tianmen was making a fuss.

Despite his thoughts, Tianhe’s willpower instantly erupted, spreading throughout the city without concealment. As the City Lord, regular patrols of the Ancient City were expected and normal.

Many powerful experts in the city sensed it, accustomed to the routine.

There were no fluctuations.

In the Ancient City, the three men and one woman walking also quickly sensed it. Seeing that no one around them showed any unusual expressions, the four didn’t pay much attention.

They allowed the willpower to sweep over them.

After the willpower passed, one of them transmitted a message: “Is this the current City Lord of the Ancient City?”

“Probably. I think his name is Tianhe.”

“Peak Sunmoon Realm!”

“These Ancient City Lords are quite diligent now, actually monitoring the entire city regularly.”

“It must be Su Yu’s arrangement.”

“…”

The group exchanged a few words in secret, then said nothing more, continuing to wander through the Ancient City.

…

Inside the City Lord’s Mansion.

Tianhe frowned slightly. Nothing seemed wrong. What was Tianmen doing?

He had swept through the city. It was a few Human Race cultivators in the Mountain Sea Realm. Nothing wrong with that. Did this need to be reported to him?

“A nervous wreck!”

Tianhe grumbled, initially intending to ignore it, but after a moment’s thought, he decided to go and check again.

He had nothing else to do anyway!

He suddenly flew out of the City Lord’s Mansion. In the mansion’s backyard, Zhou Polong opened his eyes, frowned, glanced, and said nothing more. As long as he didn’t leave the Ancient City, it was fine.

He was too lazy to care what Tianhe did.

Tianhe had some connections with Xia Longwu and was familiar with Su Yu, so some matters were difficult to interfere with. He was here only to guard the passage and temper his weapon; he didn’t care about anything else.

…

Tianhe, having left the City Lord’s Mansion, did not head directly for the four individuals. Instead, he patrolled the city.

He admonished some of the powerful experts he encountered, then walked towards the four.

At this moment, the four were being pestered by an ostrich-like creature, asking if they wanted to buy treasures.

The group was somewhat impatient but didn’t speak harshly. They were just annoyed that the creature kept trying to sell its treasures, which they had no interest in.

“Esteemed sirs, one look at you tells me you come from a great Human Race prefecture. I have an Earthly Weapon from the ancient Human Race era, unparalleled in power, comparable to today’s Heavenly Weapons. I obtained it after a narrow escape from death…”

The ostrich monster kept trying to sell its treasures to them.

Among the four, the female Mountain Sea Realm cultivator grew a bit impatient, yet also found it somewhat amusing. She said with a hint of disdain, “Ancient weapon? Earthly Weapon? I don’t think you could produce a single Earthly Weapon from your entire body. Get lost quickly. Are you trying to trick us?”

“How would I dare!”

The ostrich grinned, “It really is an ancient Earthly Weapon, just a bit damaged, truly…”

It pulled out a dark, charred piece of wood. “Look, this thing clearly has age. It has endured countless years and is still perfectly preserved. Perhaps in ancient times, it was even a Heavenly Weapon or a Divine Weapon…”

The female Mountain Sea Realm cultivator was so exasperated she laughed. “Divine Weapon? Do you even know what a Divine Weapon looks like? And an ancient Divine Weapon? Why don’t you say an ancient Emperor Weapon?”

The ostrich monster chuckled dryly, “Can an Emperor Weapon be stronger than a Divine Weapon? What’s an Emperor Weapon? Divine Weapons are the strongest, so of course, I’d say Divine Weapon…”

“Ignorant!”

The female Mountain Sea Realm cultivator snorted. The other three glanced at her, and seeing their reaction, she said no more.

Behind them, Tianhe walked along, greeting some of the experts on either side. Soon, he reached the group, brushed past them, then suddenly turned back and asked, “Which prefecture are you from?”

Among the four, a slightly older-looking male stepped forward, smiling. “Replying to City Lord, we are from Dayong Prefecture in the Human Realm.”

“Not from Great Xia Prefecture?”

Tianhe raised an eyebrow slightly, then quickly said, “Never mind, I saw your vigorous vital qi and thought you were from Great Xia Prefecture! That brat Xia Longwu hasn’t dared to come see me recently. He still owes me an opportunity!”

After grumbling for a bit, Tianhe said in a deep voice, “If you see anyone from Great Xia Prefecture, please tell them for me that Xia Longwu owes me an opportunity and should return it soon! Don’t think he’s so great just because he’s some North-Conquering General. This City Lord is also an official who followed Emperor Yu from the start, so I’m not afraid of him!”

“We will certainly relay the message!”

The middle-aged man chuckled and bowed in acknowledgment.

“Good then!”

Tianhe walked a few steps, then suddenly looked at the ostrich and reprimanded, “Don’t you dare mislead humans. You’ve got some nerve, aren’t you afraid of getting your head chopped off?”

The ostrich looked embarrassed. “City Lord, I wasn’t misleading them. I just couldn’t tell if it was an ancient treasure myself.”

“Forget it, don’t let it happen again!”

With that, he looked at the group and said, “When buying things here, be careful. If you get scammed, it just means your judgment isn’t good. No fighting is allowed in the Ancient City!”

“Thank you for the City Lord’s reminder.”

Tianhe nodded slightly, glancing at the three behind the middle-aged man. All three showed faint smiles and bowed slightly. Tianhe nodded, “There are more and more promising young talents in the Human Race, which is a good thing! Enter the Sunmoon Realm early, achieve Eternal, and if you encounter trouble, you can come to the City Lord’s Mansion to find me!”

“We trouble the City Lord!”

The middle-aged man thanked him again.

Tianhe said nothing more, stepping away to continue sweeping the sides. The four behind him watched Tianhe for a moment, then said nothing further, continuing to wander through the Ancient City.

…

Soon, Tianhe strolled around and returned to the City Lord’s Mansion.

He went straight to the backyard.

In the backyard, Zhou Polong opened his eyes.

Tianhe got straight to the point: “Your Zhou family knows a lot. Let me ask you, do you know what an ancient Emperor Weapon is?”

“Emperor Weapon?”

Zhou Polong was slightly startled. After a moment, he said uncertainly, “In ancient times, there were Divine Weapons, which Human Kings generally used. Emperor Weapons… there are vague records, perhaps used by the Four Extremes Human Kings and the Human Emperor?”

He wasn’t entirely sure, though he came from a scholarly family and knew quite a bit.

Tianhe pondered, then asked, “Among your Human Race, how many people know the term ‘Emperor Weapon’?”

“Certainly not many.”

Zhou Polong chuckled, “Even I only have a partial understanding, just some hearsay, having read some ancient texts to recall it. Normally, unless they are top-tier existences, few would pay attention to it. Otherwise, if they don’t even have Divine Weapons, why would they care about that?”

“Then let me ask another question, are the people of Dayong Prefecture very idle? Can four Mountain Sea Realm cultivators wander around freely?”

Mountain Sea Realm cultivators were neither strong nor weak, and indeed not particularly eye-catching, but it depended on where they were from.

Zhou Polong thought for a moment and said, “That wouldn’t be the case. Dayong Prefecture’s strength is average. Even now, most of its Mountain Sea and Sunmoon Realm cultivators are from the military. Non-military Mountain Sea Realm experts can still guard a region. Four of them is not a small number…”

He looked at Tianhe. Tianhe stroked his chin, then said, “Under normal circumstances, if I, in front of your Human Race, cursed Xia Longwu as a brat, what would be the reaction if they weren’t from Great Xia Prefecture?”

Zhou Polong laughed, “It depends on their stance. Previously, each prefecture had its own stance. If you cursed him in front of someone from Great Zhou Prefecture, they’d probably chuckle, thinking he deserved it! If it were Great Ming Prefecture, they’d think, ‘What’s it to me, you curse him all you want.’ If it were Great Qin Prefecture, they’d be angry, as Xia Longwu is a military god…”

“What about Dayong Prefecture?”

“Dayong Prefecture… their strength isn’t great, so they’re cautious. Most likely, they’d avoid it, not dare to respond, and be timid.”

Tianhe stroked his chin again. “What if I told them to relay to that brat Xia Longwu that he owes me something and hasn’t returned it, what would their reaction be?”

Zhou Polong frowned, “No reaction. They’d respond with an awkward smile. How could they casually accept such a message?”

Xia Longwu was a top-tier expert and a military god, and now even a direct subordinate of Su Yu. Of course, they couldn’t casually accept such a message, even if Tianhe was also part of Su Yu’s faction.

Tianhe nodded. He wasn’t human and wasn’t too clear about the situation in the various Human Race prefectures.

Now, hearing this, he exhaled and said, “I almost misjudged them. That Tianmen fellow’s vigilance is quite good!”

“What happened?”

“Four Human Race Mountain Sea Realm cultivators came into the city, claiming to be from Dayong Prefecture. The specifics are as I just told you. You can guess the rest yourself.”

Zhou Polong frowned, “Human Race Mountain Sea Realm? You mean, they’re disguised?”

“Possibly, and they have good perception. As soon as they entered the city gate, someone said, ‘It’s quite new!’”

“Quite new?”

Zhou Polong’s heart trembled slightly. “You didn’t mishear?”

“No.”

“This… the matter of replacing the guardian is a secret. Unless an Eternal personally steps into the Ancient City, they cannot perceive it. Which Eternal of the myriad races would dare to rashly step into the Ancient City?”

Tianhe nodded, “So Tianmen felt something was amiss and told me. I went to check, and I, a Quasi-Invincible Realm expert, couldn’t see anything!”

Zhou Polong’s eyes were grave. “You couldn’t tell even face-to-face?”

“No.”

Zhou Polong took a deep breath, his eyes flickering. Tianhe said in a low voice, “What’s the situation? Has your Human Race been impersonated? Spies from the myriad races? If they’ve hidden their strength, are they Eternals? Are the myriad race spies now using Eternals? Did they learn something and come to investigate if Lord Heavendoom is here?”

Zhou Polong remained silent.

Tianhe raised an eyebrow, “Or is it something else?”

With that, he chuckled, “Forget it, I won’t bother. Let the guardian handle it!”

Though he said he wouldn’t bother, his heart stirred slightly. Soon, his Vice City Lord token vibrated, directly transmitting the message to Heavendoom, and even to Su Yu himself, as Su Yu had a City Lord token.

Zhou Polong glanced at him. Tianhe said with a laugh, “Just a normal report, don’t misunderstand. I’m leaving first. Don’t go observing them; it’s easy for them to detect your identity, and that would be troublesome!”

“No need for your reminder!”

“Suit yourself then!”

Tianhe ambled away, pondering the situation. What was going on?

It was somewhat inexplicable.

Not human?

Would the myriad races be willing to use such powerful experts to investigate the Ancient City?

If they were human… that didn’t feel quite right.

Very strange!

Forget it, I’ve reported it anyway. How it’s handled is not my concern.

…

Human Realm.

Su Yu had just finished his tasks. He was about to make a trip to the Culture King’s Residence to look for the treasure Xingyue mentioned was buried there.

Just as he was about to set off, a City Lord token vibrated slightly.

Now, as Su Yu’s strength grew and he could communicate between life and death, the City Lord token’s range also expanded.

There was no need for intermediaries to relay messages.

Soon, he glanced at it. It was from Tianhe, who rarely sent him messages. Su Yu read it for a while, also puzzled. What did it mean?

A few humans, a bit problematic…

Mountain Sea Realm, or disguised?

“Spies?”

Su Yu was puzzled. Spies were normal. Did such a small matter need to be reported to him?

However, if they were Eternals investigating the guardian’s situation, then it was indeed worth paying attention to, lest his plans be disrupted.

Su Yu thought to himself, who should he send to investigate?

Just as he was thinking, Great Zhou King flew over quickly. Seeing Su Yu, he took a deep breath and said, “Emperor Yu, there might be a small problem!”

“What?”

Su Yu checked the time. “Let’s talk as we go. I need to go to Fatty’s place.”

Great Zhou King said no more, quickly following Su Yu into the air.

As they flew towards Starfall Mountain, Great Zhou King said, “Polong just sent me a message. Four more people have appeared in the Ancient City.”

“Oh, what about them?”

Great Zhou King hesitated, then quickly said, “I’m not entirely sure! Those few people know about ancient Emperor Weapons!”

“What the hell?”

Yes, Su Yu didn’t know.

He hadn’t paid attention to that.

Great Zhou King explained, “Actually, there was only one ancient Emperor Weapon, the Human Emperor Seal.”

“Oh, what about it?”

Great Zhou King didn’t know if Su Yu genuinely didn’t understand or was pretending not to, so he explained himself, “Unless they were some high-ranking figures from ancient times, the concept of Emperor Weapons should have been unheard of!”

“How do you know?”

“I… Torchbearers know about Emperor Weapons.”

Su Yu nodded, “What does that imply?”

“It implies that these four people either learned about it from some ancient texts, or they are powerful experts from ancient times, or they are inheritors of ancient experts, the kind whose lineage was never broken!”

Su Yu chuckled, “There are many ancient texts, and many ruins. Knowing a term doesn’t mean anything.”

“No, the concept of Emperor Weapons…”

Great Zhou King said in a deep voice, “Even if there are records, there wouldn’t be many. Most would definitely record it as the Human Emperor Seal, not as an Emperor Weapon! The Zhou family knows a bit, also from some texts I wrote. Logically speaking, in today’s Human Race, perhaps no one would mention the term ‘Emperor Weapon’.”

“So they’re fake humans?”

“Not necessarily!”

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, “Just tell me directly, stop beating around the bush. If not, go capture them. Why so much nonsense!”

Great Zhou King was silent for a moment. “I suspect they are Torchbearers!”

“What?”

“I suspect they are Torchbearers!”

Great Zhou King said in a deep voice, “Perhaps Torchbearers who came down from the Upper Realm! Or Torchbearers who brought people down to the Lower Realm.”

Su Yu was startled. “Lower Realm?”

Great Zhou King said in a low voice, “Torchbearers actually control a passage between the Upper Realm and the Lower Realm.”

“Hmm?”

Su Yu’s eyes suddenly flashed with a sharp light as he looked at him. Great Zhou King lowered his head and said in a deep voice, “It’s not that I didn’t tell you, but this passage has been abandoned! It’s been abandoned for many years! The passage to the Life Realm is the safest and most direct! The passage controlled by the Torchbearers is too dangerous. Many people died in the past to open this passage, and later, only one in ten survived the teleportation! So by the Third Tide, this passage was abandoned!”

Great Zhou King said in a deep voice, “After that, it was never opened again!”

Su Yu frowned, “Then why do you suspect they are people who came down from the Upper Realm?”

Great Zhou King exhaled, “The Emperor Weapon is one point. Torchbearers like to use the term ‘Emperor Weapon,’ meaning the weapon of an emperor! While outsiders, when speaking of it, would only say ‘Human Emperor Seal’! Also, appearing in Heavendoom Ancient City, because Heavendoom Ancient City is closest to the Human Race. If they were humans from the Upper Realm, they definitely wouldn’t come to the Human Realm first, but would observe from the closest place outside the Human Realm. Furthermore, if they were spies from the myriad races who knew about the Ancient City, they wouldn’t investigate Heavendoom Ancient City first, but would choose an Ancient City closer to their own territory. Heavendoom Ancient City belongs to the Eastern War Zone, so placing spies here would be easily discovered…”

Su Yu frowned, “So you suspect Torchbearers have descended to the Lower Realm?”

“Yes.”

“Why not think they were already in the Lower Realm?”

“If they were already here, then they would most likely be within the Human Realm, not outside.”

Su Yu said nothing more, asking, “Where is that passage?”

“Emperor Yu, that passage is too dangerous. I don’t know how they managed to come down. If my guess is correct, their descent to the Lower Realm might have come at a huge cost…”

“Where?”

Su Yu looked at him. Great Zhou King hesitated, then seeing Su Yu’s cold gaze, he reluctantly said, “In the endless void! But I’m not lying. If you want to sneak into the Upper Realm, be prepared for more than half of your people to die before even getting there! I didn’t mention it because this passage has been abandoned for too many years, and I never thought it would be opened again.”

He said in a deep voice, “And those who knew about it should be mostly dead! As far as I know, even if there are still Torch
