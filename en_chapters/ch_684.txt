Chapter 684: A Great Treasure! (Please Subscribe)

(The writing is a bit stuck, let's take it slow.)

The Myriad Realms had been relatively quiet for some time now. Over three months had passed, with only a minor ripple caused by Su Yu's previous confrontation with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis. In the grand scheme of things, three months was merely a blink of an eye.

Yet, the myriad races were quite content with the current peace. Aside from the smaller races in the Eastern War Zone who were suffering, the other races were eager to avoid any major disturbances. Many Eternals had perished, and even several Daofuse experts had fallen. These smaller races dared not involve themselves in such large-scale battles.

The Allheaven Battlefield had seen a slight resurgence in activity. Life had to go on, after all. The battlefield was rich in source qi and treasures, and one couldn't simply sit idle in a small realm forever. Currently, the Human Race was focusing its main efforts on the small realms in the east, nearly sweeping them clean!

The eastern regions, amidst the chaos of war, had become quite lively. Some small races that chose to surrender were now daring to emerge. For these races, the Human Race's dominance in the Allheaven Battlefield was actually a good thing. As for the suppression of their leaders, that was a matter for the leaders to deal with.

On the Plains of Desire, one could see figures from various races. The ancient city still stood, though it had changed hands. However, for others, it made no difference. There was still a powerful presence guarding it, an Eternal, which meant little to the weaker beings.

Heavendoom Ancient City had always been situated on the Plains of Desire, near the edge of the Sea of Stars. At this moment, the ancient city was showing signs of life again. There were more people than before, and it was no longer as desolate.

Within the entire city, the death aura had significantly diminished, mainly because the monarchs blocking the gates of the Death Realm had disappeared. On the second day after Su Yu contacted the experts of various races, several figures appeared at the gates of Heavendoom Ancient City.

Three men and one woman, all humanoid. Currently, Zhou Potian was overseeing Heavendoom Ancient City, while the City Lord of Tianhe was still present, though he was less involved in affairs. He knew that with Heavendoom gone, he and Zhou Potian were essentially monitoring each other to prevent any leaks.

At the city gates, a Sunmoon Realm general was still stationed, the familiar Tianmen General. At this moment, Tianmen General glanced at the four individuals, noticing nothing unusual. They seemed to be from the Human Race.

Nowadays, Human Race experts were scattered across the Allheaven Battlefield, seeking opportunities, invading small realms, seizing resources, and exploring the Sea of Stars. Since the ancient city was under Su Yu's command, it wasn't uncommon for people from the Human Race to visit. Half of the city's population was human.

Seeing a few humans was not surprising. The four seemed to be at the Shanhai Realm, not particularly eye-catching in strength. They entered through the side gate, and Tianmen General only gave them a cursory glance.

"Something feels new..."

At that moment, Tianmen General's ears twitched slightly. Something felt new? Was he referring to the ancient city? The city hadn't changed much; the buildings remained the same, except for the core defensive weapons that had been replaced. Most people were unaware of this, and even Tianmen General wasn't fully informed, but having guarded the gates for many years, he had a sense of it.

The current ancient city didn't feel as dangerous or oppressive as before. It was indeed lacking a certain edge! Of course, this was a conclusion he reached after guarding the place for centuries.

Tianmen General didn't ask or interfere; it was a matter for the higher-ups. Perhaps it was related to Su Yu, and he knew better than to ask questions he shouldn't. Among the newcomers, one of them remarked, "It feels new," but the other three remained silent, continuing their journey into the city.

Tianmen glanced at them again, finding nothing amiss. He frowned slightly, wondering if he was overthinking things. It was just a casual remark. He didn't know the situation, so how could outsiders?

He turned back, deciding not to dwell on it. However, the group behind him seemed to sense something, with one of them glancing back at Tianmen before quickly turning away and continuing on.

On the city wall, Tianmen General frowned slightly. Had they just looked at him? How keen! After a moment's hesitation, he activated the city gate token. Something felt off, though he couldn't pinpoint what. Better to let the City Lord take a look.

He sent a message to Tianhe and soon stopped worrying about it.

...

In the City Lord's Mansion.

Tianhe was enjoying a leisurely life lately. With Heavendoom gone, the new overseer, Zhou Potian, was relatively polite to him, unlike Heavendoom, who would often berate him for being useless. He was familiar with Zhou Potian, having known him before.

However, Zhou Potian's credentials were too light, so Tianhe wasn't too afraid of him. It was best not to provoke each other. He spent his time drinking tea and reading books, his desire to prove his Dao having waned considerably. As a quasi-invincible, he was now focused on cultivating himself, feeling that not proving his Dao wasn't a big deal.

While sipping tea and reading, his deputy city lord token vibrated. After sensing it, he cursed inwardly. Tianmen was being overly cautious. Such a trivial matter, and he had to disturb him. This ancient city saw visitors every day. A few Shanhai Realm individuals, not even Eternals!

Even Zhou Potian hadn't said anything, yet Tianmen was making a fuss. Despite his thoughts, Tianhe still released his willpower, spreading it throughout the city without concealment. As the City Lord, regular inspections were expected and normal.

Many experts within the city sensed it, but it was a common occurrence. There were no fluctuations. The three men and one woman walking through the city also sensed it. Seeing that no one around them reacted, they paid it no mind.

They allowed the willpower to sweep over them. After it passed, one of them transmitted, "Is this the current City Lord of the ancient city?"

"It should be. I think he's called Tianhe."

"Sunmoon Peak Realm!"

"These ancient city lords are diligent now, even conducting regular inspections."

"Probably Su Yu's arrangement."

The group exchanged a few words but didn't dwell on it, continuing their exploration of the ancient city.

...

In the City Lord's Mansion.

Tianhe frowned slightly. There was nothing wrong. What was Tianmen doing? He had scanned the area and found a few Shanhai Realm humans, nothing unusual. Did this really need to be reported to him?

"That neurotic fellow!" Tianhe muttered. He intended to ignore it, but after some thought, decided to take another look. He had nothing better to do anyway.

Suddenly, he flew out of the City Lord's Mansion. In the mansion's rear courtyard, Zhou Potian opened his eyes, frowned, and glanced over but said nothing. As long as Tianhe didn't leave the ancient city, he didn't care what he did.

Tianhe had some connections with Xia Longwu and was familiar with Su Yu. It was best not to get involved in certain matters. Zhou Potian was here to oversee the passage and hone his weapon, nothing more.

...

After leaving the City Lord's Mansion, Tianhe didn't head straight for the four individuals. Instead, he patrolled the city. He reprimanded a few experts along the way before finally heading towards the group.

At this moment, the four were being pestered by an ostrich-like creature trying to sell them treasures. They were growing impatient but refrained from harsh words, simply annoyed by the creature's persistent sales pitch. In truth, they had no interest in its wares.

"Dear sirs, I can tell you're from the major prefectures of the Human Realm. I have an ancient human weapon from the past, unmatched in power, comparable to today's heavenly weapons. I risked my life to obtain it..."

The ostrich creature continued to pitch its treasures. Among the four, the female Shanhai was growing impatient, yet she found it amusing. With a hint of disdain, she said, "An ancient weapon? A ground weapon? I doubt you have anything of the sort. Move along, trying to scam us?"

"I wouldn't dare!" The ostrich grinned. "It's truly an ancient ground weapon, just a bit damaged. Really..."

It pulled out a piece of black wood. "Look, this thing has clearly aged, surviving countless years, still so well-preserved. It might have been a heavenly weapon or even a divine weapon in ancient times..."

The female Shanhai laughed in exasperation. "A divine weapon? Do you even know what a divine weapon looks like? An ancient divine weapon? Why not claim it's an ancient imperial weapon?"

The ostrich chuckled awkwardly. "An imperial weapon stronger than a divine weapon? What's an imperial weapon? Divine weapons are the strongest, so of course, I'd say divine weapon..."

"Ignorant!" The female Shanhai snorted. The other three glanced at her, and she fell silent.

Behind them, Tianhe approached, greeting a few experts along the way. Soon, he reached the group, brushing past them. After a few steps, he turned back and asked, "Which prefecture are you from?"

Among the four, an older-looking male stepped forward with a smile. "Replying to the City Lord, we are from the Dayong Prefecture in the Human Realm."

"Not from the Great Xia Prefecture?" Tianhe raised an eyebrow, then quickly said, "Never mind. I thought you were from the Great Xia Prefecture because of your vigorous qi and blood! That brat Xia Longwu hasn't dared to come here lately, owing me an opportunity he hasn't repaid!"

Muttering to himself, Tianhe said sternly, "If you see anyone from the Great Xia Prefecture, tell them Xia Longwu owes me an opportunity and should repay it soon! Just because he's the Northern Expedition General doesn't mean he's anything special. I, too, am a minister from the time of Emperor Yu, not afraid of him!"

"We will certainly pass on the message!" The middle-aged man smiled, cupping his hands in a gesture of respect.

"Good!" Tianhe took a few steps, then suddenly turned to the ostrich, scolding, "Don't scam the Human Race. You're bold, not afraid of losing your head?"

The ostrich looked embarrassed. "City Lord, I wasn't scamming. I couldn't tell if it was an ancient treasure."

"Fine, just this once!" Tianhe said, then turned to the group. "Be cautious when buying things here. If you're scammed, it's because of poor judgment. No fighting is allowed in the ancient city!"

"Thank you for the reminder, City Lord."

Chapter 1: The Ancient Weapon

In the heart of the bustling city, the aura of the ancient past lingered like a whisper in the wind. Tianhe, a figure of authority and mystery, nodded slightly, casting a glance at the three individuals standing behind the middle-aged man. They all wore faint smiles and bowed slightly. Tianhe acknowledged them with a nod, "It's good to see more promising talents among the Human Race. Enter the Sunmoon Realm early, prove your Eternal Dao, and if you encounter any trouble, feel free to seek me out at the City Lord's Mansion."

"Thank you, City Lord!" The middle-aged man expressed his gratitude once more.

Without further words, Tianhe turned and continued his patrol, his entourage trailing behind him as they wandered through the ancient city.

...

Soon, Tianhe completed his circuit and returned to the City Lord's Mansion, heading straight to the backyard.

In the backyard, Zhou Polong opened his eyes.

Tianhe got straight to the point, "Your Zhou family knows a lot. Tell me, do you know what an ancient imperial weapon is?"

"Imperial weapon?" Zhou Polong was momentarily taken aback. After a pause, he replied uncertainly, "In ancient times, there were divine weapons. The Human Kings typically wielded divine weapons. Imperial weapons... I vaguely recall some records, perhaps used by the Four Extremes Human Kings and the Human Emperor?"

He wasn't entirely sure, despite his extensive family knowledge.

Tianhe pondered, "Do many in the Human Race know the term 'imperial weapon'?"

"Certainly not many," Zhou Polong chuckled. "Even I only have a vague understanding, having heard bits and pieces and read some ancient texts. Under normal circumstances, unless one is a top-tier existence, they wouldn't pay attention to such things, especially if they don't even possess a divine weapon."

"Let me ask you another question. Are the people of Dayong Prefecture very idle? Four Shanhai Realm cultivators wandering around freely?"

Shanhai Realm cultivators weren't particularly strong or weak, but it depended on the context.

Zhou Polong thought for a moment, "No, they wouldn't be. Dayong Prefecture's strength is average. Even now, most of their Shanhai and Sunmoon Realm cultivators come from the military. Non-military strong cultivators would still hold significant positions. Four is not a small number..."

He looked at Tianhe, who rubbed his chin and continued, "Under normal circumstances, if I were to curse Xia Longwu in front of the Human Race, calling him a grandson, what reaction would you expect if they weren't from Great Xia Prefecture?"

Zhou Polong laughed, "It depends on their stance. Previously, each major prefecture had its own stance. If you cursed in front of someone from Great Zhou Prefecture, they'd probably snicker and think he deserved it. If it were Great Ming Prefecture, they'd think it's none of their business. If it were Great Qin Prefecture, they'd be angry because Xia Longwu is a war god..."

"And what about Dayong Prefecture?"

"Dayong Prefecture... not very strong, cautious, likely to avoid confrontation, and respond timidly."

Tianhe rubbed his chin again, "What if I told them to pass a message to Xia Longwu, saying that he owes me something and hasn't returned it? How would they react?"

Zhou Polong frowned, "No reaction, they'd respond with an awkward smile. How could they casually respond to such a statement?"

Xia Longwu was a top-tier powerhouse and a war god, now closely associated with Su Yu. Even though Tianhe was also part of Su Yu's faction, they couldn't casually respond.

Tianhe nodded. He wasn't part of the Human Race and wasn't too familiar with the situation in each prefecture.

After hearing this, he exhaled, "I almost missed it. Tianmen is quite vigilant!"

"What happened?"

"Four Human Race Shanhai Realm cultivators arrived in the city, claiming to be from Dayong Prefecture. The situation is as I just described. You can guess the rest."

Zhou Polong frowned, "Human Race Shanhai Realm? You mean they're disguised?"

"Possibly, and they have sharp eyes. As soon as they entered the city gate, someone remarked, 'Quite new!'"

"Quite new?" Zhou Polong was startled, "Did I hear that right?"

"Yes."

"This... the matter of changing the guards is confidential. Unless an Eternal personally enters the ancient city, they can't sense it. Which Eternal from the myriad races would dare to enter the ancient city rashly?"

Tianhe nodded, "That's why Tianmen found it suspicious and informed me. I went to take a look. Even as a quasi-invincible, I couldn't discern anything!"

Zhou Polong's expression grew serious, "Face to face, and you couldn't tell?"

"Yes."

Zhou Polong took a deep breath, his eyes flickering. Tianhe spoke in a low voice, "What's going on? Is someone impersonating the Human Race? Are they spies from the myriad races? If they're hiding their strength, could they be Eternals? Have the spies from the myriad races started using Eternals? Do they know something and are here to investigate if Lord Heavendoom is present?"

Zhou Polong remained silent.

Tianhe raised an eyebrow, "Or is it something else?"

He then laughed, "Forget it, it's not my concern. The guards can handle it themselves!"

Though he said it wasn't his concern, he was slightly moved. Soon, the Deputy City Lord's token trembled slightly, transmitting the message to Heavendoom and even to Su Yu himself, who held the City Lord's token.

Zhou Polong glanced at him, and Tianhe chuckled, "Just a routine report, don't misunderstand. I'm leaving now. Don't observe them too closely, or they might trace your identity, and that would be troublesome!"

"I don't need your reminder!"

"Suit yourself!"

Tianhe wandered off, pondering the situation. What was going on?

It was all rather baffling.

Were they not Human Race?

Would the myriad races really use such powerful individuals to investigate the ancient city?

If they were Human Race... something felt off.

Very peculiar!

Forget it, I've reported it. How to handle it isn't my concern.

...

In the Human Realm.

Su Yu had just finished his tasks and was preparing to visit the Culture King's Residence to search for the treasure Xingyue mentioned.

Just as he was about to set off, the City Lord's token trembled slightly.

With Su Yu's growing strength and his ability to communicate between life and death, the range of the City Lord's token had also expanded.

There was no need for intermediaries.

Soon, he glanced at the message from Tianhe. Tianhe rarely communicated with him, so Su Yu was puzzled. What did this mean?

A few Human Race individuals, something was off...

Shanhai Realm, or perhaps disguised?

"Spies?"

Su Yu was puzzled. Spies were normal. Was this worth informing him about?

However, if they were Eternal Realm, investigating the guards' situation, it was indeed worth paying attention to. He didn't want his plans disrupted.

Su Yu pondered, who should he send to investigate?

Just as he was thinking, the Great Zhou King swiftly approached. Seeing Su Yu, he took a deep breath and said, "Emperor Yu, there might be a small problem!"

"What is it?"

Su Yu checked the time, "Let's talk while we walk. I need to visit Fat Ball." 

The Great Zhou King didn't say much, quickly following Su Yu as they soared through the air.

As they flew towards Starfall Mountain, the Great Zhou King explained, "Just now, Polong sent me a message. Four individuals appeared in the ancient city."

"Oh, what's the issue?"

The Great Zhou King hesitated for a moment before quickly saying, "I'm not entirely sure! Those individuals know about ancient imperial weapons!"

"What?"

Indeed, Su Yu was clueless.

He didn't pay much attention to it.

The Great Zhou King explained, "Ancient imperial weapons, there's actually only one, the Human Lord Seal."

"Oh, so what?"

The Great Zhou King wasn't sure if Su Yu was genuinely ignorant or pretending, so he explained, "Unless one is from the upper echelons of ancient times, they wouldn't have even heard of imperial weapons!"

"How do you know?"

"I... the Torchbearer knows about imperial weapons."

Su Yu nodded, "What does that imply?"

"It implies that these four individuals either learned from some ancient texts, are ancient powerhouses themselves, or are inheritors of ancient powerhouses, with an unbroken lineage!"

Su Yu laughed, "There are many ancient texts and relics. Knowing a term doesn't mean much."

"No, the term 'imperial weapon'..."

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Even if there are records, they wouldn't be many. Most would certainly record it as the Human Lord Seal, not as an imperial weapon! The Zhou family knows some because of the texts I wrote. In theory, no one in the current Human Race would mention the term 'imperial weapon.'"

"So, they're not Human Race?"

"Not necessarily!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Just say it directly. Stop beating around the bush. If necessary, go capture them. Why so much nonsense?"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a moment, "I suspect they're Torchbearers!"

"What?"

"I suspect they're Torchbearers!"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Perhaps Torchbearers from the Upper Realm have descended, or Torchbearers have brought people down."

Su Yu was taken aback, "Descended?"

The Great Zhou King spoke in a low voice, "The Torchbearer actually controls a passage between the Upper Realm and the Lower Realm."

"Hmm?"

Su Yu's eyes suddenly flashed with a fierce light as he looked at him. The Great Zhou King lowered his head and said solemnly, "It's not that I didn't say it, but this passage has been abandoned! It's been abandoned for many years! The passage through the Fate Realm is the safest and most direct! The passage controlled by the Torchbearer is too dangerous. Many people died to open it back then, and later, only one in ten survived the transmission! So by the third tide, this passage was abandoned!"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "Since then, it has never been opened again!"

Su Yu frowned, "Then why do you suspect they're from the Upper Realm?"

The Great Zhou King exhaled, "The imperial weapon is one point. Torchbearers like to use the term 'imperial weapon,' the weapon of the emperor! Outsiders, when mentioning this, would only say the Human Lord Seal! Moreover, they appeared in Heavendoom Ancient City because it's closest to the Human Race. If they're from the Upper Realm, they wouldn't come to the Human Realm first but would observe from the nearest point outside the Human Realm. Also, if they were spies from the myriad races, knowing about the ancient city, they wouldn't investigate Heavendoom Ancient City first but would choose an ancient city closer to their area. Heavendoom Ancient City belongs to the Eastern War Zone, and placing spies there would easily be discovered..."

Su Yu frowned, "So you suspect the Torchbearer has descended?"

"Yes."

"Why don't you think they're originally from the Lower Realm?"

"If they were originally here, they'd most likely be within the Human Realm, not outside."

Su Yu didn't say much more and asked, "Where is that passage?"

"Emperor Yu, that passage is too dangerous. I don't know how they came down if my guess is correct. They might have paid a huge price..."

"Where?"

Su Yu glanced at him. The Great Zhou King hesitated, but upon seeing Su Yu's cold gaze, he finally spoke, "In the Endless Void! But I wasn't lying. If you want to infiltrate the Upper Realm, be prepared for heavy casualties even before you get there! I didn't mention it because this passage has been abandoned for many years, and I never thought it would be reopened."

He continued in a deep voice, "Moreover, those who knew about it are mostly dead by now! As far as I know, even if there are still Torchbearers, there wouldn't be more than three who know about it."

"Now there are four!"

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, "Second and third generation Torchbearers?"

"I don't know about that."

Su Yu pondered for a moment, "Never mind, just keep an eye on it for now. Focus on the important matters! It seems like all sorts of people are emerging... I'll arrange for someone to monitor them, so you don't have to worry about it!"

The Great Zhou King spoke softly, "If they are indeed Torchbearers, risking coming down to the lower realm, they might have an important mission. Perhaps they're here seeking aid!"

Aid?

Su Yu was slightly taken aback, suddenly realizing something, "Are you saying that the Upper Realm is in danger, and some Torchbearers can't wait any longer, so they sent people down to seek help, hoping we can create some disturbances in the lower realm?"

To divert the attention of the myriad races in the Upper Realm.

The Great Zhou King nodded, "That's my only guess. Otherwise, the passage is extremely dangerous, and they wouldn't send people down recklessly! Emperor Yu, those few might not be bad people, nor have ill intentions. They might just want to observe and see if they can gain some support in the lower realm. Please... don't kill them rashly."

He was worried that Su Yu might do just that.

Without a word, he might just kill them.

Su Yu rubbed his chin and smiled, "Alright! If they are indeed from the Upper Realm, I'll make sure to give them a warm welcome."

The Great Zhou King's expression changed.

Su Yu said irritably, "What? I mean it, a warm welcome. I know too little about the Upper Realm, and what you know is outdated. Of course, I want to treat them well. As long as they are polite and share some information with me, I'll treat them as honored guests! Do you think I kill everyone I see? That I destroy anyone from the Upper Realm? Am I crazy?"

The Great Zhou King felt awkward. He really thought that way.

Because Su Yu had always seemed indifferent to the strong from the Upper Realm.

Su Yu chuckled, "Don't overthink it. I have no hostility towards the human experts in the Upper Realm. I only dislike two kinds of people: first, traitors! Second, those who want me to listen to them but refuse to listen to me!"

"As long as they're not traitors and aren't foolishly demanding I listen to them, they're friends!"

Su Yu laughed, "Great Zhou King, isn't my stance clear enough? It's so obvious. As long as they listen, they're on our side. What are you worried about?"

The Great Zhou King felt a bit deflated and helpless, "I just..."

"I used to think you were a master strategist, but lately, you've been nagging like an old woman, endlessly entangled in these matters..."

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, "Concern leads to confusion. I'm worried you might kill the Hundred Battle King."

"Hmm?"

The Great Zhou King decided to go all out and sighed, "The Hundred Battle King isn't dead! He should be in the Upper Realm! He might be suppressed, but it's a fact that he's not dead! This is actually the hope for some of us old-timers. His survival is a good thing. When I mentioned delaying for decades, I was actually hoping that the Hundred Battle King could make a comeback! After all, he has strength close to that of a master of laws!"

Today, the Great Zhou King was laying it all out, "So, our hope is still pinned on him! In the last battle, he was defeated, but as long as he learns from it, with his strength, there's still hope for a comeback! We haven't despaired because he's still alive!"

The Great Zhou King looked at Su Yu, "Emperor Yu, maybe you can't understand! But he truly is the last straw for us old folks! Before you rose to power, tell me, could the human race have turned the tide?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and shook his head, "Difficult!"

"Exactly!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "We all knew it was difficult! So after the last battle, when we were defeated, we didn't flee immediately. Instead, we communicated through some special means, waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the Hundred Battle King to return! Only he is the hope... After all, he's incredibly powerful! It's not that we're foolish, it's just... there really was no other hope!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "I also wondered if this tide could produce a strong figure like him, but in the past few hundred years, as you've seen, even the Great Qin King didn't see this hope. Even because the Hundred Battle King was still alive, the Daofuse couldn't do anything! I could only abandon all thoughts and wait for his return!"

He spoke with increasing bitterness, "So, with Emperor Yu's sudden rise, and my hope pinned on the Hundred Battle King for thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, I can't easily... transfer this hope."

"It's not just me. Those in the Upper Realm who know he's not dead probably feel the same way because we saw no hope before, only him, as the sole lifeline!"

Su Yu listened silently for a long time, then nodded, "Hearing you say this, I somewhat understand you! Treating the Hundred Battle King as hope for countless years, and now, at the last moment, a new uncertain factor emerges. It's indeed hard to accept quickly."

The Great Zhou King breathed a sigh of relief, "It's good that you understand. It's not that we insist on this, but thousands of years of emotion can't be easily shifted."

Having treated the Hundred Battle King as hope for thousands, tens of thousands of years, suddenly changing now is indeed difficult.

Su Yu smiled, "So, is he injured, sealed, or hiding?"

"Sealed!"

The Great Zhou King explained, "Although I didn't see the exact process, he was indeed sealed! We don't know where he's sealed, but Marquis Minshan once said that even if sealed, the next time the Upper Realm opens, with the tremors of the Great Dao, some seals will loosen! Every time the world trembles, it's the best time for unsealing!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "True, the Martial Emperor is also preparing to unseal himself at that time! It seems the opening of the Upper Realm in the Allheaven Battlefield is a good opportunity for unsealing. If the Hundred Battle King unseals at that time, there's hope for a comeback. That's what you all think, right?"

"Yes."

Su Yu laughed, "But haven't you considered that those who sealed him back then might also know he could unseal during this tide?"

"We can only gamble on this chance!"

The Great Zhou King said solemnly, "We have no other choice!"

"Alright, it seems his unsealing is inevitable, but it might be more troublesome after unsealing! Whatever!"

The Great Zhou King felt a bit of a headache, "If Emperor Yu helps with the unsealing, maybe... maybe the Hundred Battle King can assist Emperor Yu. His strength is still extremely formidable! Some of the old antiques of the myriad races in the Upper Realm are very strong! In the Ninth Tide, some of the old antiques didn't even descend to the lower realm."

"We'll see!"

Su Yu didn't want to say much more. Soon, he arrived at Starfall Mountain. Seeing the Great Zhou King still there, he smiled, "Alright, I know the situation! If it really doesn't work, you can take your people and join up with those from the Upper Realm to rescue him! Then, you can live your own lives together! I'm not unreasonable. As long as you don't cause trouble for me, I won't bother with you! But the benefits your people received from me, return them!"

Su Yu laughed, "Great Zhou King, before he unseals, stay grounded. Don't think too much all day! The myriad races haven't been dealt with, and I still have to worry about your issues. If you annoy me, I'll deal with you first!"

Su Yu smiled, "The matter of the Hundred Battle King ends here! If he really unseals, do as you please! I don't want to hear about him again, nor do I expect him to help me. Do as you wish! As for those four, don't worry about them. I'll have someone keep an eye on them! Also, do your job. Be the Great Zhou King for a day, do what a Great Zhou King should do!"

"Tomorrow, I will take action, and so will you. No more words!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "I won't cause trouble for Emperor Yu!"

"That's best!"

Su Yu laughed, "Alright, go back! The matter of the Hundred Battle King is a small thing! He couldn't even handle the myriad races, and he wants to compete with me? If you really meet him, remind him yourself, or else... I'm ruthless! That's it, I'm off to find Fat Ball. You go do what you need to do!"

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly and had no choice but to retreat.

As he was leaving, he thought for a moment and said, "If... if I say I trust you more, you... think..."

"Unnecessary!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "Believe it or not, you're an old man. Do you think I'll be moved because you believe I can win? Don't be ridiculous! I, Su Yu, started from scratch. My people were all recruited and trained by me. To be honest, I don't particularly like your kind."

"......"

Speechless.

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, but finally said, "If the Hundred Battle King truly unseals, I will stand on the side of the human race, on the side of the majority, and I won't unconditionally side with him just because he's our hope! Moreover, even if I leave, Zhou Tianqi guarantees that it will only be me. I won't take anyone with me! Even my son will fight for Emperor Yu!"

"Your son is too weak, whatever!"

Another blow!

The Great Zhou King was helpless, "Then... I'll take my leave!"

The Great Zhou King left.

Su Yu chuckled. The old guy, he somewhat understood the Great Zhou King's thoughts. He might think he's better, more suitable than the Hundred Battle King, but some of the old antiques in the Upper Realm might favor the Hundred Battle King more.

The Great Zhou King wanted to be this bridge... Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him.

It's normal; they weren't familiar with each other.

Meeting face to face, a 21-year-old youngster, could the old antiques be at ease?

Su Yu didn't care!

The Great Zhou King probably knew himself that he didn't care about these things, but was worried Su Yu might really eliminate those old antiques, so he tried to mediate the conflict.

"Well-intentioned, but unfortunately, neither side may appreciate it! Creating trouble for himself, caught in the middle."

Su Yu concluded.

Chapter 701: The Hidden Treasure

Without further ado, Su Yu quickly stepped into the Culture King's Residence. What exactly had Xingyue buried here?

...

At that moment, Su Yu was curious, Fat Ball was curious, and even Little Furball, having escaped from the big tree, perched atop Su Yu's head, feigning curiosity—perhaps just an excuse to avoid studying.

In the backyard, Su Yu discovered three blue flowers.

Fat Ball looked puzzled. "Is there a treasure? I don't know. I've been watering these flowers, but I've never dug them up. If something was buried here, it must have been before I became aware of things, a long time ago!"

Su Yu wasn't sure either. "I don't know what it is or if there's anything at all, but seeing these three blue flowers, which have remained unchanged for countless years, there might really be something here!"

He glanced at Fat Ball. "Should we pull up the flowers?"

"…"

Fat Ball hesitated, clearly reluctant. "Do we have to? They're so pretty."

Su Yu chuckled. "Pulling them up might not kill them. We can dig around, and if there's no treasure, we can replant them."

"Well…" Fat Ball was conflicted, lying on the ground with a hint of sadness. "Alright, alright, just don't let them die! Seriously, why bury something under flowers? So boring!"

Ask Xingyue.

Su Yu was speechless. How would he know Xingyue would bury something here? His curiosity was piqued, and he was eager to find out.

Quickly, he uprooted the three flowers and began digging into the soil. The earth here was unusual, but Su Yu didn't care and kept digging downward.

After digging a few meters deep, almost reaching the River of Time, Su Yu's eyes lit up!

Little Furball and Fat Ball also craned their necks to peer down.

Su Yu hurriedly picked up a buried box, his face alight with excitement. "There really is something! Xingyue actually buried a treasure here! Fat Ball, do you think it could be a supreme treasure?"

Fat Ball was skeptical. "Would a supreme treasure be buried here?"

It didn't believe it!

"Maybe it's a shoe?" Fat Ball guessed. "Or a hairpin? A shuttlecock? A hair tie?"

"Even those would be treasures!" Su Yu grinned. "If they haven't decayed from ancient times until now, they must be treasures! Just the box itself seems extraordinary. It's a treasure."

Holding the box, he climbed back up and quickly filled the hole. "Let's open it and see. Maybe it's a pill?"

The box was sealed.

With curiosity, Su Yu and Fat Ball moved to the front yard, placing the box on a stone table. Even the large tree nearby revealed a face, seemingly curious as well!

What kind of treasure could it be?

Unable to contain himself, Su Yu quickly opened the box!

There was no dazzling light, no earth-shattering phenomenon, nothing at all. Inside the box lay a small stone, quietly and unassumingly.

Su Yu and the others were dumbfounded.

What was this?

Just a small stone?

Were they being pranked?

Su Yu looked at Fat Ball, who shook its head. "Don't look at me. It's just a stone. I didn't switch it. You dug it up yourself."

Su Yu's mouth twitched. Xingyue… are you messing with me?

He picked up the stone. It was quite heavy, but no matter how he looked at it, it was just a stone!

Speechless!

Su Yu weighed it in his hand, squeezed it, and frowned slightly. "Hmm, it's pretty hard. I couldn't crush it. Fat Ball, try squeezing it."

Fat Ball extended a paw and scratched it, but the stone remained unmarked.

Fat Ball was slightly surprised. "It's very sturdy!"

Su Yu was a bit taken aback. Could it actually be a treasure?

Regardless of whether it was or not, the fact that Fat Ball couldn't leave a mark on it meant it was definitely not simple. It could even be used as a weapon!

Su Yu examined it closely, fiddling with it for a while, but nothing changed. He sighed, "Forget it. I'll ask Xingyue about it later. For now, I'll be on my way."

"Alright!" Fat Ball called out. "If you need help, just call me!"

"Sure!"

Carrying the box and the stone, Su Yu left the Culture King's Residence. Little Furball tried to sneak away, but Su Yu tossed it back to Fat Ball. "Study more before you go. It seems like you've been making good progress lately! Don't run around!"

Little Furball felt aggrieved, but Su Yu ignored it, quickly departing with his items.

He had things to do the next day and couldn't stay long.

As for the stone, whatever it was, for now, it would just be treated as a stone.

...

Not long after Su Yu left, the Culture King's Residence suddenly trembled violently!

Fat Ball quickly unleashed a powerful surge of blood energy to suppress the disturbance, while the big tree extended countless branches and leaves!

Stabilizing the residence's grounds!

After a while, it finally calmed down. Fat Ball blinked in confusion, then suddenly wore a mournful expression. "Oh no, that… that seems to have been the foundation stabilizing the house!"

It had always thought this place was stable for countless years because it was the Culture King's stronghold.

But now, with that thing removed, the residence was destabilized!

This meant that the stone Su Yu took was more important than the entire Culture King's Residence!

Fat Ball's face was filled with despair. How could it get it back?

That stone turned out to be a treasure stabilizing the River of Time!

Fat Ball was utterly dejected. Now that it was in Su Yu's hands, could it ever be retrieved?

Suddenly, it looked at Little Furball and bared its teeth. "Don't say a word. Next time we see him, I'll ask for it back, saying it's useless and he should return it…"

Little Furball blinked and nodded.

No way!

It would definitely secretly tell Xiangxiang that they had found a great treasure!

It seemed that stone was more important than all the treasures in the Culture King's Residence. They had struck it rich!

If it told Xiangxiang, he would surely take it away.

Meanwhile, Fat Ball's dog face was full of despair. It had failed to guard the house properly and inadvertently lost the most precious treasure in the house!
