Chapter 826: Slaying Ancient Beasts for Fun

The Human Emperor's spirit and flesh were separated, his physical body gravely injured, and even his Sea of Will might have been harmed. A mere facade!

This news left Su Yu somewhat helpless. I rely on you, you rely on me, and yet you're just a coward! In front of others, you act indifferent, but behind their backs, you weep. How frustrating!

I had thought that with over ten rulers of laws by my side, no matter what, you would prevail, because weren't you the one holding back the myriad races? Turns out... you were just bluffing!

On this day, Su Yu experienced both the joy of a great victory and a sense of weariness. When will these days come to an end? As for the Human Emperor, I can't rashly approach him. If I provoke the myriad races into a desperate fight, it would be troublesome. If the Human Emperor's facade is shattered, everyone will suffer.

"Did the Culture King and the others set you up, so now you're setting me up?"

"Sigh!"

A long sigh, tinged with rare desolation.

...

At this moment, Su Yu wasn't elsewhere; he was right in front of the Gate of Hell, holding a piece of chaotic will, waiting. Waiting to see if any fool would come over.

Many had died here, and Su Yu hadn't seized the power of laws from them. Even when Yue Zhan and the others fell, including the demise of Granny Long and Yu Qing, Su Yu didn't absorb their power of laws. If none of the rulers of laws show up after such powerful figures have fallen, it would be a waste.

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian was also present, studying the seemingly inactive Gate of Hell. Soon, he spoke, "Your Majesty, this gate indeed has a slight gap, allowing passage. Entering is relatively simple, but exiting is more complicated... Don't be fooled by its appearance as just a gate. Upon exiting, they might see layers of overlapping spaces! With chaotic will as a guide, they can know where to exit..."

He continued, "However, with Yu Qing dead, those behind the gate know! So I suspect that no one might dare to come out now!"

Su Yu calmly replied, "Anything is possible! The Yu lineage and the ancient beast lineage might not be on such good terms! The Yu side might not dare to come out, fearing a trap... but luring some ancient beasts out is still possible! I've long seen through these people; none of them are good!"

Marquis Tongtian chuckled, "Indeed! Your Majesty is right!"

"And you?" Su Yu looked at him, "You previously absorbed some shadows of the Gate of Hell. How's that going?"

Marquis Tongtian sheepishly replied, "Not great, not enough... unless Your Majesty kills the Martial Emperor. If you do, I can definitely become a ruler of laws!"

"..."

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him. He glanced at the distant Human Mountain, which was now empty, standing alone between heaven and earth. The Gate of Hell, with its restrained divine aura, appeared like an ordinary gate.

With a single strike, Human Mountain had dispersed much of the Gate of Hell's divine brilliance. The Gate of Hell was an incredibly powerful existence, yet Human Mountain's strike had almost made it disappear.

Su Yu suddenly smiled. Human Mountain... the mountain of the human race. Anyone who ascends it for a long time will develop a sense of belonging to the human race and a sense of responsibility towards it.

Human Mountain! How interesting! This mountain, standing here for countless ages, remains conspicuous between heaven and earth, yet few attempt to destroy it, and even fewer succeed.

He didn't dwell on it further and soon set aside the matter of Human Mountain. Sometimes, it's better to be ignorant. Living too clearly isn't good; smart people die quickly because their minds work too fast, exhausting themselves. It's the fools who live longer. Just look at the Martial Emperor and the others.

"How can we seal it off and prevent anyone from coming out?" Su Yu asked.

Marquis Tongtian thought for a moment and said, "It's not too difficult! We can't close the crack, but if we destroy the chaotic will, they'll lose their guide. Disperse the surrounding energy, and they'll lose the power to open the crack. As long as no one dies nearby... they can still come, but it will take a lot of time! The Sin Clan planned for many years, and Yu Qing just came out. Of course, this is related to the crack opening on its own!"

Marquis Tongtian had some research on this and continued, "I can patch up the crack in the Gate of Hell a bit, at least delaying them for a while, preventing anyone from coming out."

"How long can you seal it for?"

"Hard to say!" Marquis Tongtian replied solemnly, "If no supreme power attacks, I think sealing it for a few years is possible. If there is... then it's hard to say!"

"If they attack, you'll notice, right?"

"Of course!" Marquis Tongtian nodded.

Su Yu looked again at the gate with its restrained divine aura and asked, "Can you consume its main body?"

"No way!" Marquis Tongtian replied sheepishly, "Your Majesty, don't be fooled by its appearance as just a gate. It's actually sealed and dormant. If it awakens, there's an entire era inside... if I consume it, I'll surely die!"

Don't joke around! You're overestimating me! If I could consume the Gate of Hell, I would have done it long ago.

Marquis Tongtian thought for a moment and added, "I think consuming its main body is impossible unless I reach the level of a first-class ruler of laws!"

Su Yu's eyes narrowed! First-class! The level of the ancient Human Emperor! Marquis Tongtian actually gave such an answer, indicating that without reaching first-class, he couldn't consume this gate. That was a terrifying thought.

Indeed, if this gate weren't powerful, how could it seal an entire era? But where did this gate come from? Who built it? The Gate of Hell, the Earth Gate, is the only one visible in the myriad realms.

Su Yu suddenly paced towards the gate, and Marquis Tongtian hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, be careful! This gate is currently sealed and dormant. Otherwise, it could easily swallow you, sealing you inside the Gate of Hell!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, approaching the gate for a closer look. The gate... pitch black, like hell itself, no wonder it's called the Gate of Hell.

Just as Su Yu was about to touch it, Marquis Tongtian quickly said, "Don't, Your Majesty. A strong person like you touching it might awaken it, and if it swallows you, it will be troublesome!"

Su Yu frowned, withdrew his hand, and didn't dare to touch it. Alone, I might want to see what's inside, but now, it's better not to.

Su Yu pondered for a moment, "Is this gate really so strong that even someone like the Human Ancestor can't break it or come out?"

Marquis Tongtian explained, "Your Majesty, it's not just the power of the gate sealing them inside! There are also additional chains from the one who sealed it, and the power of a fallen era, that great extinction force!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. Marquis Tongtian continued, "Moreover, the strong ones behind the gate might not want to come out right now."

"Hmm?" Su Yu looked at him, and Marquis Tongtian thought for a moment before saying, "Sometimes, entering the gate might not be passive; it could be voluntary! Like Zhou Ji and the others, they might not want to come out now... perhaps they're waiting for an opportunity! I have a feeling the gate will open soon, indicating that the opportunity has arrived!"

"Opportunity?" Su Yu murmured, "Everyone talks about opportunity! But what exactly is this opportunity? At the level of the Lord of Time and the Lord of Death, what are they still pursuing?"

He looked up at the sky, unable to see the River of Time, and remained silent for a while. Perhaps it was related to the River of Time. The first to open the heavens, the most mysterious and powerful.

Is all of this related to him? The gate, the opener of the heavens, the sealed era, the creation of chaos...

Su Yu stopped asking questions, waiting silently. Waiting for ancient beasts to emerge! Kill a few, strengthen my world, and if no beasts come out, seal it. This place won't open for a while, nor can it be opened.

...

On the first day, no ancient beasts appeared. But on the second day, perhaps thinking the coast was clear, or seeing a rare opportunity, or maybe someone deliberately incited them to test the waters, the long-silent gate suddenly trembled slightly!

Not only did it tremble, but a faint voice came from behind the gate, not in the human language, but a sense of will and character permeated through.

"Are there any living beings outside the gate?"

With a hint of probing intent. At this moment, Su Yu remained silent. No, I'm not a living being; I'm the ancestor of living beings. Asking is pointless.

Not far away, a world appeared. The Gate of Hell was now within Su Yu's world range. However, Su Yu didn't cover the Gate of Hell, keeping it separate to avoid triggering it and causing trouble.

But if someone came out, no matter which direction they ran, they couldn't escape his world. Su Yu waved his hand, and in an instant, the South Heavenly King and others appeared. Someone was about to come out!

With another wave, the Tea Plant appeared. Su Yu looked at her and transmitted, "Return to your original form!"

The Tea Plant obediently reverted to her original form! Su Yu transmitted, "The plan for the Tea Plant wasn't used on the Sin Clan, so let's use it on these ancient beasts. Otherwise, if one comes out and is immediately killed, the other side will sense it!"

"This time, the limit is five!" Su Yu transmitted, "If five come out, seal the gate and kill them all! If five don't come out within a day, seal the gate and kill them all!"

With that, the Tea Plant was planted in the world, looking somewhat broken. The others quickly disappeared, appearing beneath the Tea Plant.

Su Yu gave the Tea Plant only one task... to sell information! Sell it to the first one to come out! As fellow chaotic ancient clans, they could communicate, couldn't they?

With a wave of his hand, the area turned chaotic, and the entire Upper Realm was instantly shrouded in chaos, filled with ruins, resembling the aftermath of a great battle, as if two sides had perished together!

As for the nearby Kingdom of the Prison King, Su Yu didn't care. Those above the Sunmoon Realm were mostly dead, and the rest were killed by the battle's aftermath. The survivors were relocated by the Great Zhou King and others, but not sent to the Human Realm.

With many empty realms in the lower world now, there's no shortage of places to live. Su Yu couldn't be bothered with these ordinary people.

The Great War erupted, and after slaughtering the enemy's experts, the fighting usually ceased unless it was a racial or extermination war. Su Yu had no interest in venting his anger on the Devil Subduing Army, despite their enmity. Many of them were ordinary humans unaware of the Myriad Realms, and Su Yu, having reached this level, didn't care much about them. These people had migrated to other realms, and in a few years, they might face extinction. Even if they survived, rising again would be difficult.

After making all the necessary preparations, Su Yu vanished from the scene. The portal continued to tremble, and it seemed as if the entire world had been destroyed. Only in a remote corner, a lone Tea Plant struggled to survive, rooted in the chaos. At this moment, the Myriad Realms appeared to be utterly annihilated, presenting a post-apocalyptic scene of a world-ending battle.

Indeed, it was quite similar. The mountain of corpses was drenched in blood, remnants of the massacre of the myriad races, with countless bodies left uncollected. The Upper Realm now resembled a desolate wasteland.

...

Behind the portal, a ripple of sound emerged. After an indeterminate amount of time, an ancient beast resembling a large water buffalo laboriously squeezed through, poking its head out to survey its surroundings. The cold wind howled, and the buffalo was momentarily stunned by the sight. The place felt like it had undergone a great cataclysm. Was this the aftermath of a devastating battle? Had everyone perished? Was it truly this tragic?

The buffalo only knew that Yu Qing seemed to have died earlier, as did Po Long. The Myriad Realms had erupted into a great war, but now, was everyone truly dead? It looked around, seeing no signs of life, only a few corpses.

Soon, the water buffalo fully emerged. Behind the door, a voice seemed to inquire about something. The water buffalo, vibrating with willpower, transmitted a message, "The Myriad Realms... seem to have been destroyed! Or rather, the Upper Realm has been destroyed! All I see is devastation, corpses everywhere, the ruins of a great battle..."

A ripple of response came from behind the door, "Look again!"

"Alright!" The water buffalo, extremely cautious, dared not stray far from the Gate of Hell. It began its investigation, yet it hadn't discovered the Tea Plant. Master of deception Su Yu was here; how could he be easily discovered? Anything easily found wasn't worth much! Moreover, for an ancient beast to reach this level, it couldn't be too foolish. It had to find a secluded place, where the Tea Plant appeared to be on the brink of death; otherwise, who would believe it?

If it appeared blatantly before the buffalo, that would be too fake. Su Yu was all too familiar with such tactics!

"Where is the chaotic will?"

At this moment, the water buffalo murmured. The guiding route was still present, indicating that the chaotic will hadn't dissipated. Where was it? That thing was still very important. If it was a trap, finding this thing might help determine it.

It searched around and vaguely sensed traces of chaotic will. It was cautious, not daring to run around. Soon, a drop of blood seeped out, transforming into a small water buffalo that ran into the distance. After a while, the small buffalo returned with a sphere in its mouth.

The large water buffalo immediately sensed something. This thing was found in a huge crater, possibly dropped when Yu Qing died, and no one had paid attention to it.

"This chaotic will... I got it so easily..."

The water buffalo recalled what everyone had said before coming. If the chaotic will was missing and couldn't be found, it might be a trap, and they should return early. But now...

The water buffalo was momentarily dazed and quickly transmitted a message behind the door, "I got the chaotic will! It was in a huge battlefield crater!"

"You got it?"

Upon hearing this, eyes appeared behind the door. Some eyes were filled with doubt, others with confusion. Was it not a trap? Otherwise, why would this thing be casually discarded? This was their guide out, and now it was just left on the battlefield, strange! Did the other side not know about this, or were they really all dead?

They knew Yu Qing and the others had died. The myriad races and Zhou Ji had entered, but they wouldn't make a big fuss, only cautiously, not daring to reveal anything. So, they were in the dark about the current situation in the Myriad Realms.

"Is that Su Yu dead too?"

They only knew that the one who killed Yu Qing and the others seemed to be someone named Su Yu. The specifics weren't clear.

"Not sure!"

The water buffalo said, then suggested, "How about... going to the Lower Realm to take a look?"

Saying this, it felt a chill and thought better of it. If the Upper Realm was destroyed and the Lower Realm still existed, with Su Yu and those who killed Yu Qing still there, wouldn't going down be courting death?

"Getting the chaotic will is a good thing! With this, we can continue to locate the Myriad Realms... Old Buffalo, investigate further, see if you can find any survivors!"

"I'll try!"

The water buffalo searched for a while but still didn't find the Tea Plant. Hidden in the void, Su Yu was getting anxious. Fool! Since you got the chaotic will, don't you know this thing can activate some chaotic ancient beasts to heed your call? Damn! Do I have to teach you this?

Normally, shouldn't you pick up this thing and try to see if there are any ancient beasts alive nearby? Those are your kin! Su Yu was exhausted! Ancient beasts, truly foolish! I'm so tired! Do I have to teach you how to be properly deceived next time I scam you?

I accounted for many things, but I didn't expect these idiots wouldn't follow the script. You should use the chaotic will to investigate; I'm dying of anxiety!

"When a group of guys is too stupid, maybe deceiving them should be simpler!"

Su Yu worried that these guys wouldn't understand too complex a scheme. It's like scamming someone out of money; if the person is a fool, you just walk up and say, "Give me money, and I'll buy you candy!" And they give it to you!

But now, Su Yu had designed many things, setting this up and that, and the result was that the other side, like an idiot, didn't notice these things and just walked past... It's frustrating!

Performing a play for a deaf audience!

In the void, Su Yu complained. Fortunately, the water buffalo wasn't fighting alone. Among the chaotic ancient beasts, there were still some with brains, and Su Yu's plan was aimed at those with brains!

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the portal, "You got the chaotic will? Then check if there are any ancient clans left in this Chaos Mountain! With the chaotic will, the ancient clans can be intimidated, making it easier to gather information!"

Upon hearing this, the water buffalo suddenly remembered and exclaimed, "Right, right, the Spirit Ape Supreme is insightful; I almost forgot!"

Other ancient beasts echoed, "Yes, first find the ancient clans!"

The water buffalo quickly extended its willpower, and soon, a faint willpower spread in all directions.

"Chaotic ancient clans, come forth to pay homage!"

The willpower spread out! But there was no response from the surroundings. The water buffalo's expression changed slightly. Were they all dead? The chaotic will had a strong control over the chaotic ancient clans. While it was difficult to control beings like the Eight-Winged Tiger and the Chaos Dragon, those below the Heavenly Venerable level could almost all be controlled.

It searched again, and this time, the water buffalo seemed to sense something. It pondered, "It seems... there is a response, but... it's very weak. Is it injured, or just very weak?"

"Should we take a look?"

A suggestion came from behind the door. The water buffalo thought for a moment. There really seemed to be no one around. It quickly said, "Then I'll take a look and come back immediately. If I don't return, something happened. Be careful, don't come out recklessly!"

"Don't worry!"

Soon, the water buffalo flew into the distance. After flying for a while, it reached a large mountain, now shattered. At the foot of the mountain, in a pit, a somewhat damaged Tea Plant was rooted nearby. At this moment, its light was dim, appearing on the brink of death.

"Hmm?"

Seeing the Tea Plant, the water buffalo was slightly stunned, "It's a member of the Chaotic Ancient Wood Clan, but... it's too heavily injured, about to die!"

Was this small Tea Plant the one responding to it?

"Daofuse Realm..."

Not very strong! Daofuse was quite common, and there were many Daofuse Realm beings among the ancient beasts in Chaos Mountain. However, most others had perished, but here was a surviving ancient wood, lucky to have survived.

The water buffalo examined the surroundings, then quickly descended. A surge of chaotic power emanated from its body, permeating the Tea Plant. The Tea Plant trembled slightly, seemingly recovering a bit. Suddenly, its branches swayed, emitting a chaotic voice, "Who... are you?"

The water buffalo's eyes revealed a hint of a smile. It was alive!

"I am the Ancient Buffalo Supreme!"

It spoke with a literary flair, then quickly asked, "Are you from the ancient clan here?"

"I... I'm not... I was... summoned by Lord Chaos Dragon from the depths of chaos... but... the lords are all dead..."

The water buffalo nodded slightly, its massive head swaying as it asked, "What happened here?"

"A great battle... a battle of powerful experts..."

The Tea Plant spoke incoherently, and the water buffalo took a while to understand, piecing together what it already knew to deduce what had happened here.

A great battle! A battle of powerful experts! The Myriad Realms had been unsealed! Then, a group of rulers of laws appeared, one called Hundred Battle, and another called Su Yu, who fought fiercely. Then a giant appeared, whose name the Tea Plant didn't know, only that the two men fought until the heavens collapsed!

Then, countless people died! In the end, Hundred Battle died, and Su Yu, with a few remaining experts, fled to the Lower Realm, leaving the Upper Realm in its current state!

"Su Yu isn't dead?"

The water buffalo inhaled sharply. It knew of Hundred Battle, and according to this account, not only Hundred Battle but also a powerful woman was involved. Yet, despite the deaths and escapes, Su Yu was still alive! However, it seemed he was injured!

"When he fled, how many people did he have left?"

The Ancient Buffalo asked, and the Tea Plant's branches swayed, "I don't know! A few, maybe!"

"A few? How many rulers of laws?"

Chapter 1: A Brewing Storm

The ancient bull, Gu Niu, felt a bit exasperated with the Tea Plant. It seemed rather naive, which wasn't surprising given that the Ancient Wood Race was notoriously slow to develop intelligence. Yet, the fact that Su Yu was alive was indeed significant news.

Quickly, Gu Niu grabbed the Tea Plant and flew towards the Gate of Hell. The Tea Plant was startled but soon calmed down as nothing untoward happened.

...

Moments later, in front of the Gate of Hell, Gu Niu recounted the situation. A voice echoed from behind the gate, "Can we trust what this little fellow says?"

Gu Niu, unconcerned, replied, "It doesn't know much, and its strength is weak. If not for the chaotic will sweeping through several times, I wouldn't have noticed it. Its aura is so faint that if I had delayed a bit longer, it would have been completely dead... Just some incoherent words, what's there to doubt?"

What a fuss over nothing! Such a minor issue, and they still question it?

Moreover, the Tea Plant didn't know much. Most of what it said was Gu Niu's own deductions based on past events. Instead of questioning the Tea Plant's credibility, they might as well be questioning Gu Niu himself!

"So, you're saying Hundred Battle King is dead, and Su Yu is alive! As expected... I thought if Hundred Battle King were alive, there would have been some news. Turns out he's already fallen... This Su Yu is indeed formidable!"

"Formidable, but it doesn't matter. He's young, and it seems he's gravely injured this time!"

"How many rulers of laws does he still have under his command?"

"This ancient wood is too dim-witted to give a clear answer..."

Behind the gate, a group of powerful beings discussed among themselves. The Tea Plant, still confused, suddenly said, "I... I don't remember much, nor can I discern anything... But I've been here all along, and my main body left some imprints... Are they useful?"

The water buffalo was taken aback but quickly laughed, "Right, your Ancient Wood Race can imprint everything. Hurry and show me!"

"But..." The Tea Plant's voice was bewildered, "I... I don't have any more chaotic power!"

Troublesome, so many issues.

Gu Niu infused some chaotic power again, and the Tea Plant finally projected an image. It was somewhat blurry and unstable, but Su Yu's shadow could be vaguely seen. He was constantly coughing up blood, exuding a cold and fierce aura, followed by three powerful figures!

At this moment, those three figures also appeared weak. The group of four flew away from the Tea Plant, all bearing injuries!

Su Yu struggled to fly, and one of the three behind him tried to support him, but he shook them off. This small gesture was particularly noticeable. Gu Niu observed and laughed, "This Su Yu... even when gravely injured, he maintains his dignity as a leader!"

"A formidable character! Even Hundred Battle King and his group lost to him!"

"Indeed formidable!"

"But his injuries are severe, and the three behind him seem to have just advanced to rulers of laws, all injured..."

"Naturally, before, among the myriad races, who was stronger besides the Martial Emperor?"

"......"

Speaking of the Martial Emperor, Gu Niu pondered, "Little one, do you know where the Martial Emperor went?"

"Martial Emperor? I don't know him!"

Gu Niu fell into contemplation, "Where did the Martial Emperor run off to? Could he have died too?"

Behind the gate, someone speculated, "Could he have perished alongside Zhou Ji or Yu? Otherwise, it would be difficult for Su Yu's side to kill those two, right?"

"......"

It was hard to determine, but soon, Gu Niu suddenly suggested, "At this moment, it seems that only Su Yu's side has four strong individuals left, all injured... Should we...?"

Suddenly, he felt tempted!

Why not strike while the iron is hot?

"The strong of the myriad realms have all but annihilated each other. Before the Human Emperor and his group return, why don't we strike first, kill Su Yu and his group, slaughter the myriad races, and open the Gate of Hell to bring out more ancient races?"

As soon as he said this, a commotion erupted behind the gate!

Should they make a move?

The myriad realms were indeed shattered!

Most were dead!

At this moment, why not send a few out to slaughter?

Gu Niu added, "Many strong ones have died before. I see there's still plenty of energy in the rift. Not to mention many, four or five can still come out... We're all in peak condition, and Su Yu's group is heavily injured. This is the only chance... Otherwise, once Su Yu recovers, he will definitely come here!"

"If we kill Su Yu and his four strong ones, we might be able to bring out five or six more. With ten or more rulers of laws, we could ambush the Human Emperor and his group... We might achieve a great victory!"

Gu Niu was excited, but behind the gate, an ancient beast worriedly said, "But what if..."

Gu Niu knew what the other was worried about and directly said, "No matter what, us coming out won't be a bad thing. At worst, we'll stay near the Gate of Hell. If there's danger, we'll immediately retreat. Do they dare to chase us in? Right now, I'm the only one outside, which is dangerous!"

I want you all to come out and bolster my courage!

Su Yu's side still has several strong ones. They might be healing now, but once they finish and come to investigate, what will I do?

Gu Niu continued, "This is a rare opportunity. Otherwise, once the power near the gate dissipates, it will be hard for us to come out. Now that the Control King's lineage is all dead, and Hundred Battle King and his group are gone... Without them, we'll have to wait for the Gate of Hell to open on its own!"

Now, there's no one to guide us out!

That was true. Soon, an ancient beast said, "Then I'll go out and take a look!"

It's a rare opportunity; let's go out and see!

Isn't Gu Niu safe?

The chaotic will is also present!

Let's go out!

Before long, the portal trembled, and another ancient beast squeezed out. First come, first served; those who come later will find it harder to get out!

At this, Gu Niu also interjected, "I think maybe four or five is the limit. Other old friends who want to come out... well, it's up to luck!"

As soon as he said this, another ancient beast silently squeezed through the gate.

Including Gu Niu, that made three.

Not many spots left!

When the second ancient beast squeezed out and laughed heartily, the other ancient beasts couldn't hold back. Behind the gate, an ancient beast angrily shouted, "I first..."

"I'll go first!"

"Once I'm out, I'll kill Su Yu and his group, then guide you out..."

The portal shook violently!

Moments later, several ancient beasts came out one after another, making five in total with Gu Niu. The sixth was trying to squeeze through but ran out of energy, lamenting, "I'm stuck here. Quickly kill some and let the Gate of Hell's power pull me out... Otherwise, it'll take me a long time to get out on my own!"

The five ancient beasts that emerged were all overjoyed!

Hesitate, and this is what you get!

Now, whether you can come out depends entirely on us. If we don't want to guide you, none of you can come out, while we can return at any time. How delightful!

...

In the void, Su Yu shook his head.

So easy to deceive!

Five ancient beasts, and they just came out like that. It was too simple!

He reached out, and the Martial Emperor's physical body appeared. The next moment, another Martial Emperor appeared, looking at Su Yu with some grievance. I just left, and you're calling me back?

"Kill the ancient beasts, five of them. You're only allowed to kill one, and it counts towards the five rulers of laws you owe me!"

Su Yu even set a restriction, "No overkill. If you kill more, it won't count! Your target is that bat-like creature!"

The Martial Emperor looked down and was dumbfounded, transmitting, "Are these guys idiots?"

They actually came out and right into Su Yu's world's encirclement!

My heavens, for the first time, I realize there are so many fools!

Isn't this seeking death?

"I might as well take all five..."

The Martial Emperor suddenly felt that in Su Yu's world, with some suppression, he might be able to kill them all by himself and clear the five slots at once!

"No, even if you kill them all, it only counts as one. Your task is just that bat. If you kill others... it won't count!"

The Martial Emperor was helpless!

Shameless!

The strongest one was probably a weak third-tier, while the other four were three fourth-tiers and one fifth-tier. The fifth-tier, once suppressed in Su Yu's world, could probably be killed by a Heavenly Venerable!

Killing them was too easy!

And Su Yu quickly transmitted to the surroundings, "That's probably all. The sixth one is stuck and can't come out, meaning the power from the deaths of Control King and his group is exhausted. Let's just take these five! Five is good enough. They're all in my world. Once they die, I'll absorb them all, leaving none behind. It should be enough for me to improve a bit!"

This fishing tactic felt quite satisfying!

As for Control King and his group, even if Su Yu wanted to absorb them before, there wouldn't be much to gain. Now, he could absorb everything.

The next moment, Su Yu transmitted to Marquis Tongtian, "Once I make a move, seal the gate immediately! Don't let those inside see, to avoid exposing our strength. After killing these five, the Gate of Hell can be put aside for now!"

"I'll deal with that bull, a fourth-tier, not weak!"

"The Martial Emperor will handle that bat, average strength!"

The Martial Emperor wanted to retort, you're really shameless!

"South Heavenly King will deal with that pig-headed monster, average strength!"

The Martial Emperor again wanted to retort, truly shameless, that one is indeed average, the weakest, a Heavenly Venerable could probably kill it.

"Great Zhou King, deal with that elephant... also average strength, you can do it!"

"Everyone else, surround and kill that crocodile!"

"......"

At this moment, in the shadows, a group of people exchanged strange glances, all looking at Great Zhou King, whose mouth twitched wildly!

Su Yu, you're really something!

Even a blind person could see that South Heavenly King was dealing with the weakest, the Martial Emperor with the strongest, and he was dealing with the average... But one person was still difficult, while the remaining dozens of strong ones were dealing with a creature as strong as the one he was facing!

For heaven's sake, be a decent person!

I'm begging you!

Such pettiness!

Just because I didn't tell you everything, you treat me like this?

Still pondering, the next moment, Su Yu's authoritative voice echoed in everyone's ears, "Attack!"

...

Boom!

The Five Great Powerhouses were still in high spirits when suddenly, the portal trembled. Before they could react, five colossal beasts were sliced apart and instantly teleported in different directions.

On Su Yu's side, the ancient bull had just emerged when it was met by Su Yu. The bull felt its strength being suppressed; originally a fourth-tier, it suddenly felt as weak as a fifth-tier.

Before it could regain its senses, a terrifying aura erupted from Su Yu!

Second-tier!

A second-tier against a fifth-tier... It was akin to the Martial King battling a Chaos Dragon back in the day. Under normal circumstances, if one punch couldn't kill, three punches would surely do the job.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Three punches!

Indeed, Su Yu delivered three punches. After the third punch, the ancient bull was torn apart, its body shattered and merged into the heavens and earth. In its final moments, it was left in a daze.

Who am I?

Where am I?

Ah, I'm dead!

...

Elsewhere, the other beasts were being besieged. Among the dozens of powerhouses, several rulers of laws joined forces, making it all too easy to take down a suppressed fourth-tier ruler of laws!

In the blink of an eye, swords, spears, and halberds were unleashed, and with a thunderous explosion, the opponent was obliterated!

Over on the South Heavenly King's side, the South Heavenly King was no weakling here. The opponent was suppressed to the Heavenly Venerable realm, and it wasn't long before the South Heavenly King shattered them with a whip!

As for the Martial Emperor, he roared furiously, taking advantage of his unified body to unleash a frenzied assault!

He was close to the second-tier, while the opponent was suppressed to the fourth-tier, creating a significant gap.

In this wild barrage, he paid no heed to anything else, continuing his relentless assault for over ten minutes. Only then did the Martial Emperor thrust his spear through the opponent, panting heavily, yet visibly delighted. Finally, he had taken one down!

Now, he only owed four more!

This kill was exhilarating!

While they reveled in their success, the Great Zhou King’s expression shifted. The opponent... wasn't suppressed!

He almost cursed Su Yu's ancestors!

Can't you act like a human being?

How could you do this?

Leaving me to handle one alone was bad enough, but you didn't even suppress the opponent. You're... truly despicable!

In an instant, four of the five ancient beasts were slain.

The last one was locked in a fierce battle with the Great Zhou King. The beast was terrified but had no way to escape, forced to fight the Great Zhou King to the death!

In the distance, Su Yu crossed his arms, making sarcastic remarks, "The Great Zhou King hasn't fought in a while; his combat skills have dulled. I found him a worthy opponent. Let's all watch... I believe the Great Zhou King can win, hopefully without getting injured!"

Su Yu continued, threatening, "Elephant, you have no escape. Your only option is to self-destruct, take out your opponent, and then try to escape with your will sea..."

Boom!

It made sense; indeed, it was the only way out.

With a loud explosion, a cloud appeared, and Su Yu grabbed someone out. The Great Zhou King was covered in soot, his scalp tingling from the blast!

Meanwhile, Su Yu casually crushed a sphere, which was the opponent's will sea.

Done!

Su Yu tore apart the chaotic will, tossing half to the Tea Plant and the other half to the two ancient beasts emerging from the distant heavens and earth. Finally, he looked at the dazed Great Zhou King, laughing through a voice transmission, "Next time you try to deceive me, the outcome won't be this pleasant. Zhou Tian, if you keep hiding things from me, I'll turn you into a fool sooner or later!"

The Great Zhou King was left bewildered, feeling utterly unlucky!

To encounter such a petty new emperor!

He was on the verge of tears, convinced that Su Yu would indeed turn him into a fool.

However, at this moment, Su Yu had no interest in dealing with him. In an instant, the heavens and earth expanded once more, and Su Yu was in high spirits. Slaying ancient beasts and fools was quite satisfying; five of them were killed in a flash!

What a pity there wouldn't be a second time. Otherwise, he could fish for more, expanding his world into an enormous sky!

As for the ancient beasts behind the gate, Su Yu couldn't care less about their thoughts.

Let them be terrified or relieved!

The Gate of Hell was now effectively blocked by Su Yu, and for the time being, no one could emerge from it.

Thus, the Gate of Hell was temporarily concluded.
