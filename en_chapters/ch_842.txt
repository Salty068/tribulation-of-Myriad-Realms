Chapter 842: The Decision (Seeking Subscription)

The atmosphere between the two continents was tense. Ever since the Human Emperor was severely injured, large-scale battles had become rare, mainly to prevent the true condition of the Human Emperor from being exposed. The Myriad Races, despite holding an advantage, rarely initiated attacks, and even when they did, it was only small-scale skirmishes.

However, at this moment, the tension was palpable. Everyone was considering whether something had happened in the rear of the human forces.

...

Further back, Su Yu was chatting with Xingyue. This battle might still require Xingyue's assistance.

"Can you draw upon the power of my world and extend it here?" Su Yu asked.

This was something he couldn't be sure of. Although his world's power had spread far, it was still positioned further back. If he retreated too far, the Myriad Races might not believe him. But if he could draw it here, it would be different. Using Xingyue as a medium, there was hope for success.

Xingyue frowned. "So far?"

She found it difficult. She knew that if Su Yu's world's power covered this area, their side would be strengthened while the enemy would be weakened. If successful, it would indeed be remarkable, but the difficulty of drawing it here was significant.

After some thought, Xingyue said, "I'll give it a try, but I can't guarantee success!"

With that, she looked at Su Yu and frowned. "You've just arrived, and you're already planning to start a war?"

Su Yu was truly a war fanatic.

Su Yu chuckled, squinting his eyes. "Isn't this to give you face? We're all your subordinates. If I come here and don't make some noise, wouldn't people look down on us?"

"…"

Xingyue understood his intentions and couldn't help but want to curse. What a liar! As if she would believe him.

Su Yu laughed and quickly said, "Try to draw the power of the world over. I'll go take care of other things!"

Xingyue nodded slightly.

Su Yu glanced at Tongtian not far away and beckoned him over. The Marquis of Tongtian hurriedly approached.

...

Soon, Su Yu led the Marquis of Tongtian to the rear.

The Marquis of Tongtian was a bit confused. Why call me alone?

Su Yu's first words startled him. "To win this battle, you are the key!"

"…"

The Marquis of Tongtian almost gasped. You're overestimating me, Your Majesty. Don't say that!

"Whether we lose many people or none at all, you are also the key!"

"…"

The Marquis of Tongtian instantly became nervous. "Your Majesty, I'm only a fifth-tier… among those present, I'm the weakest!"

"You are the gate!"

Su Yu said calmly, "You are a special existence, one that can open doors and transmit even within the River of Time!"

"I haven't integrated you into my world because I know too little about gates, and I don't understand your path!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "The River of Time restricts many abilities, including suppressing some paths of transmission. But for you… there is no such suppression, right?"

The Marquis of Tongtian thought for a moment and nodded.

Su Yu was silent for a while before continuing, "I will try to draw some power from the Heaven Gate. If you can devour it, you might reach the fourth tier!"

This was not easy.

The Marquis of Tongtian pondered, but he liked the idea of devouring the power of the Heaven Gate!

Seeing him deep in thought, Su Yu hesitated for a moment before saying, "Tongtian, the Heaven, Earth, and Human Gates are all incredibly powerful, and you are no different. I believe you will become such an existence in the future!"

The Marquis of Tongtian forced a laugh. I don't dare to think about it.

Because Su Yu praising him meant he was in danger!

The Marquis of Tongtian understood this logic.

Su Yu… might want him to do something extremely dangerous.

I'm scared!

My heart is uneasy!

"Your Majesty, what exactly do you want me to do?"

He still asked. Just say it quickly; I'm really anxious.

Su Yu said seriously, "I want you to do many things!"

Many?

"First, conceal us!"

"The Myriad Races are not fools. After being tricked so many times, they will definitely consider the possibility of the Human Emperor setting a trap. If it were so easy to hide over thirty rulers of laws, they would have been ambushed long ago! So, I need someone to hide us… You are very suitable. Open your portal and let us hide inside… I don't know what it's like inside your portal; I can't probe it. Gates are too special!"

The Marquis of Tongtian's face struggled, looking conflicted.

Hide inside my portal?

This… this is akin to Su Yu and the others opening their sea of will for others to observe. For the Marquis of Tongtian, this was difficult to accept.

He remained silent.

Moreover… the Marquis of Tongtian hesitated. "Your Majesty, with so many strong individuals going inside… if I try to lock the aura, I might explode!"

Su Yu said, "You won't. I will first suppress everyone's power of the Great Dao. If you open the portal, it shouldn't explode. If it really becomes dangerous… I can choose not to enter!"

If he didn't enter, the biggest burden would be gone.

The Marquis of Tongtian was a bit helpless and only agreed after a long pause. "Alright then!"

Although it was hard to accept, he still relied on Su Yu for his advancement.

Su Yu's words sounded nice, as if he was here to discuss it with him. But actually… the Marquis of Tongtian was an old wise man. If he refused to contribute, why would Su Yu keep him around? Either he would be eliminated or abandoned.

Su Yu was a very pragmatic person.

Now, he was giving him face by coming to discuss it with him.

Su Yu smiled. "Thank you, Marquis of Tongtian! You are unique. Not only can you hide us, but you can also dive to the riverbed without much impact! This way, even if you are discovered, it won't matter much. You're just a ruler of laws, not a second or third tier…"

The Marquis of Tongtian nodded. Fine, since I can't resist, I might as well take the initiative!

The Marquis of Tongtian forced a smile. "Your Majesty, you said this is the first thing. What else do I need to do?"

"Second, after the battle breaks out, you will be responsible for controlling the overall situation…"

The Marquis of Tongtian quickly forced a laugh. "Your Majesty, you must be joking!"

"I'm not joking!"

Su Yu said seriously, "It's you! Because I will be participating in the battle and may not have time to manage it. Even if I do, I won't be as effective as you! You, along with Destiny and No Fate, will not participate in the battle!"

The three of them would not participate!

The Marquis of Tongtian's heart stirred. Su Yu continued, "The three of you will be responsible for controlling the overall situation, mobilizing forces, and rescuing participants! If a crisis arises, you must quickly teleport our people away!"

"If we fight, we must fight beautifully! Can you mark everyone so they can be teleported away at any time… including when the enemy self-destructs?"

The Marquis of Tongtian took a deep breath. What a daunting task!

At this moment, he understood.

Su Yu wanted to fight a beautiful battle, so he didn't want any casualties. Even if the enemy self-destructed, the Marquis of Tongtian had to quickly teleport everyone away. Destiny and No Fate were responsible for observing the flow of fate, predicting crises, and making preemptive judgments!

Su Yu continued, "Your task is heavy. Not only do you have to save people, but you also have to assess the situation and mobilize strong individuals to encircle the enemy! For example, if someone hides their strength and is too powerful, you must observe the entire battle and mobilize forces to encircle them!"

"Also, after mobilizing, ensure there is no local turmoil or casualties…"

The Marquis of Tongtian listened with growing alarm. This… is too difficult!

In this way, the entire battle would be under his control.

If he made a wrong judgment or a mistake, it could lead to a change in the entire situation, even total annihilation. If he had any ulterior motives, with the great authority Su Yu granted him, he could completely mobilize some strong individuals to be surrounded by the Myriad Races' powerhouses…

A slight mistake could indeed lead to total annihilation!

And such battlefield decision-making power had always been in Su Yu's hands. Now, he was giving it to the Marquis of Tongtian.

The Marquis of Tongtian suddenly felt so much pressure that he could hardly breathe. He said dryly, "Your Majesty… this… I… I feel… a bit pressured… I'm not good at large-scale operations. I'm not too familiar with the methods of rulers of laws. If I make a wrong judgment… I… can't bear this responsibility!"

Over thirty rulers of laws!

No, including the Human Emperor's side, if Su Yu's side was wiped out, the Human Emperor's side might also be doomed.

Entrusting the future of over eighty rulers of laws to him, the Marquis of Tongtian… he was about to collapse, trembling.

Su Yu said solemnly, "As a member of the Gate Clan, the Heaven, Earth, and Human Gates sealed an era! And now, you are only facing the fate of 200 rulers of laws. If you can't even bear this pressure, how can you hope to surpass the Three Gates?"

The Marquis of Tongtian was almost in tears. "Your Majesty, I… I don't have a good sense of the big picture! I may not be able to judge the situation. Also, can Destiny and No Fate be trusted? If they give bad directions… then I… I can't bear this responsibility either!"

In this battle, Su Yu actually placed his hopes on him. The Marquis of Tongtian was really about to break down!

Su Yu said indifferently, "I hope everyone under me can stand on their own! I've been babysitting for a long time. Do I have to do it every time? Are you all just here to play a minor role?"

Su Yu said in a low voice, "You are a member of the Gate Clan. Are you really that much worse than the Three Gates?"

The Marquis of Tongtian took a deep breath, then another, and finally said, "Your Majesty… then… what if the Myriad Races target me…"

"You can mobilize forces to protect yourself! With Destiny, No Fate, and you, if you feel it's not enough, I can assign another strong individual to protect you, even the Martial Emperor!"

Su Yu said solemnly, "You… are the key to this battle, so even if the Martial Emperor comes to protect you, it's possible! This way, even if a first-tier ruler of laws wants to kill you, it will take time, enough for you to gather strength!"

The Marquis of Tongtian was really about to cry!

How terrifying!

Don't do this!

The Martial Emperor, a second-tier, was going to be sent to protect him. Suddenly, the Marquis of Tongtian felt so much pressure that he was about to explode!

The next moment, Su Yu chuckled, "If it comes to it, how about I personally protect you?"

"...Forget it!" Marquis Tongtian forced a laugh. No way. With you watching over me, the pressure would be even greater. I'd crumble under it.

After some thought, Marquis Tongtian asked, "Your Majesty, what if... what if we can't match these opponents? What should we do?"

Su Yu smiled, his voice low, "At the critical moment... retreat!"

"Retreat?"

Run away?

Marquis Tongtian was startled. That would leave everyone in a terrible spot. The Human Emperor would be devastated.

Su Yu laughed, "Not running away, but retreating to the Human Emperor's side. You handle the teleportation, instantly transporting us over to eliminate the other group! Of course, you'll need to grasp the timing for this!"

Marquis Tongtian grimaced. Again, it's on me!

Su Yu patted his shoulder, "You can do it! Tongtian, this time, I'm entrusting the lives of over 30 rulers of laws, no, over 80 rulers of laws, and dozens to hundreds of Heavenly Venerables and Kings, all to you!"

"All on you!"

Marquis Tongtian gave a wry smile. You really have high expectations of me!

But at this point, he had no choice. Su Yu had made up his mind, and there was no room for argument.

...

Marquis Tongtian quickly went to make preparations. His strength wasn't particularly formidable, at least not here. He needed to plant marks on others, and only when they didn't resist could he easily teleport them. Otherwise, he couldn't forcefully teleport someone stronger than himself.

If he could, things would be simple. Su Yu could just have him teleport the Myriad Races' experts all over the place, scattering them, and that would be it. They could be picked off one by one.

Since he couldn't teleport the Myriad Races, he'd teleport his own people instead.

Having arranged things with Marquis Tongtian, Su Yu soon called for Destiny and No Fate, briefing them on their previous tasks. After a moment of silence, Su Yu spoke, "You two are smart. As for the Fate Clan... I haven't asked how the Fate Emperor chose back then, but the Fate Emperor has already fallen... I'm not concerned with his choices!"

"This battle is of great importance!"

"While I trust Tongtian won't act recklessly, I won't place all my hopes on him!"

Su Yu's voice was somewhat ethereal, "A mistake or two isn't a big deal, but... if there are too many, you two know what to do!"

Destiny and No Fate exchanged a glance and nodded.

They understood!

That's how Su Yu was. Even if he trusted someone, he wouldn't place all his hopes on the assumption that they wouldn't act recklessly.

It was precisely because of this that Su Yu could win battle after battle.

...

After briefing these three, Su Yu called for the Martial Emperor.

The Martial Emperor was still somewhat disgruntled, but he didn't dare to lash out at Su Yu.

Seeing him arrive, Su Yu smiled, "Help me with something."

"What is it?"

"Do you know Taishan?"

"..."

The Martial Emperor was speechless, "I'd recognize him even if he turned to ash!"

"That's good!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Impersonate him! You and I together, I'll impersonate the Culture King, and you impersonate the Martial King. Intimidate the Myriad Races, make them tremble with fear, and seize the opportunity to strike them down. With one impersonation, we might kill three to five rulers of laws!"

"I won't do it!"

The Martial Emperor was furious. You want me to impersonate Taishan to scare others?

I refuse!

There's no room for negotiation on this!

Su Yu laughed, "Do you think you can intimidate the Myriad Races on your own?"

The Martial Emperor opened his mouth...

Su Yu calmly said, "You don't have that prestige! Why? Because you're weak! As a weakling, this isn't the time to stubbornly cling to pride or recklessly charge in without thinking! You're not foolish. Impersonating Taishan can yield greater results... and with greater results, the rewards will be greater. Only then will you have a chance for revenge!"

"I asked around, the Martial King still has nine wives alive, one first-class, one second-class, and seven third-class! And you? You've just entered the second class, you might not even match his second wife. Do you want to seek revenge on Taishan? I promised to hold back the Culture King and the Human Emperor for you, but I never promised to hold back his wives!"

The Martial Emperor opened his mouth, struggling, "Are his... partners really that strong?"

"They are indeed that strong!"

Su Yu said calmly, "So, what you need to do now is not cling to pride, but find a way to improve yourself! Only if the battle goes well do we have hope of improving ourselves. Otherwise... if you encounter the Martial King, you're destined to be killed with a single punch!"

The Martial Emperor fell into deep thought.

Su Yu continued, "Also... are you willing to pay a price?"

"A price?"

The Martial Emperor looked at Su Yu, what did he mean?

Su Yu was silent for a moment before speaking, "At a critical moment, if there's trouble, summon the Heaven Gate and let Tongtian consume it!"

"What?"

The Martial Emperor was dumbfounded. What kind of joke was this? That would cause me significant loss!

Even if I could recover, I'd be heavily injured, just like those who opened the Gate of Hell!

Su Yu looked at him, and after a long pause, he said, "Because at that time, we might need Tongtian to turn the tide! Also, if it comes to it, you might need to self-destruct your second-class Great Dao. Later, I'll leave a martial path for you in my world!"

The Martial Emperor could barely contain himself, "Your world is only at third class at best, not even reaching second class! You want me to integrate... how will I catch up to Taishan?"

You want me to blow up the Heaven Gate, blow up the Great Dao, what will I have left?

Even if Su Yu leaves a path for me, it would only reach third class at most, unable to reach second class. Currently, Su Yu's world, aside from Su Yu himself, doesn't support others reaching second class!

I was already inferior to the Martial King, and if I fall to third class, I'll be even worse!

Su Yu watched him, letting him vent his anger. Once he was done, Su Yu continued, "You have to give to receive. You still owe me four rulers of laws... if you're unwilling... then find a way to kill four rulers of laws, no matter how weak. Once you've done that, you can leave! If you want to seek revenge on Taishan, I'll keep my promise. I'll handle the Culture King and the Human Emperor for you. After this battle, we can part ways. I won't stop you anymore!"

The Martial Emperor looked at him, frowning, "You won't stop me?"

Su Yu said calmly, "There's no need!"

The Martial Emperor didn't know what to choose for a moment. After a long pause, he said, "Then... do you think you have a chance for significant improvement next?"

"I don't know."

"..."

The Martial Emperor was a bit conflicted, "You... can't even give a promise?"

Su Yu said indifferently, "The things I promise are generally things I can achieve. If I can't, I won't bother promising! Those who trust me will have faith, those who don't, no amount of promises will matter!"

"But at least give me some hope!"

The Martial Emperor was angry, "You're saying I, a second class, have no hope at all. You just want me to blow up my Great Dao, blow up the Heaven Gate, how can I be willing?"

Give me a way out, don't you understand?

Can you even talk?

If you don't give me a way out, how can I step down?

Su Yu laughed, "Then there's hope. I've always thought I have great hope! If we really kill dozens of rulers of laws this time, with their bodies and Great Daos integrated, I'll definitely have a period of improvement!"

"Not to mention others, you're already second class. If I reach first class, you re-entering second class won't be difficult!"

The Martial Emperor hesitated for a while, then said sullenly, "I'll... consider the situation and decide, how about that?"

"Alright! Consider yourself a backup then!"

Su Yu didn't mind too much. A second-class ruler of laws, back in the day, was equivalent to a Four Extremes Human King. Hesitation was normal, especially for someone like the Martial Emperor.

The Martial Emperor felt utterly dejected!

Damn it, integrating into Su Yu's world, wouldn't that mean being under his control?

It felt a bit stifling!

...

After sending off the Martial Emperor, Su Yu called for another person.

March.

Looking at March, Su Yu was silent for a moment, "January isn't here."

March nodded.

"Is he on the Myriad Races' side?"

Su Yu asked him, and March shook his head, "I don't know. I asked the Radiant King before, and he couldn't say for sure... I don't know the specifics, he might be there, he might not."

He wasn't sure of the situation either.

Where was January?

Was he on the Myriad Races' side?

But, based on his understanding, January was clearly aligned with the Human Race. If January was on the Myriad Races' side... wouldn't they have been on guard against him long ago, or even expelled or killed him?

It was very strange!

Even if the Human Emperor wanted to plant a mole, it would work with others, but planting January, it seemed the Myriad Races wouldn't believe it!

Su Yu also fell into contemplation.

Where was January?

The probability of him being on the Myriad Races' side was actually low.

The Human Emperor wasn't an idiot. Sending January over as a spy... was almost like offering food to the enemy.

He hadn't asked about this before, and the Human Emperor hadn't mentioned it.

Could he really be on the Myriad Races' side?

Were the Myriad Races really foolish enough to include these guys in their ranks?

Su Yu wasn't sure. At this moment, he quickly said, "This might be some of the Human Emperor's backup plans. He might have more strength than it seems! I called you over, not to say much, but at a critical moment, blow up the Human Ancestor's bamboo pole!"

"Alright!"

March nodded, understanding.

Though he was reluctant... it was clear Su Yu intended to create significant results this time. Blowing up the bamboo pole wasn't surprising.

...

Su Yu continued making arrangements.

He was only arranging things on his side. As for the Human Emperor's side, he didn't need to worry. The Human Emperor had unified the myriad realms for countless years, cunning and shrewd. He might seem like an honest person, but if he were truly honest, he'd have been gone long ago.

So, since he was confident in initiating the war, luring the enemy in, and dividing and conquering them, the Human Emperor must have his own methods and strategies.

As for Su Yu, the only thing he needed to do was ensure minimal losses on his side while creating the greatest results.

...

At the same time.

On the Human Race Continent, the atmosphere was tense, like a drawn bow!

The Human Emperor seemed to genuinely have intentions of starting a war.

However, he was also somewhat restrained.

It was as if he only wanted to intimidate, not actually start a war, but still wanted to deter the Myriad Races.

...

This time, the Myriad Races couldn't sit still either.

On the Myriad Race Continent.

In the void.

Several top-tier experts gathered, their gazes fixed on the Human Race Continent. An ancient voice echoed, "What does the Human Emperor mean by this? Given his nature, if he truly intended to wage war, he would have attacked directly. There's no need for such theatrics. It seems he's trying to intimidate us."

Having dealt with the Human Emperor for so long, they were familiar with his temperament. This behavior was slightly out of character for him, suggesting a hint of hesitation.

"Why not just attack? We outnumber them. Could it be that the Human Emperor is already at the end of his strength? We should have taken the initiative long ago!" This was the voice of the Demon Emperor, though not the Flame Demon Emperor, who was considered from the previous generation.

The others ignored him. If he had the capability to lead everyone without fear of death, then they could indeed take the initiative.

"Why does it feel like the Human Emperor is bluffing, trying to scare us?" someone else speculated. The Human Emperor's actions indeed seemed like a bluff this time.

"Could it be that he has something to accomplish and doesn't want us to interfere, hence the intimidation?"

"......"

They speculated further.

Another voice chimed in, "Is the Human Emperor truly gravely injured? Where is his true body? It's been years since anyone has seen him!"

"It's hard to say. Perhaps he's luring us into a risky attack... The Human Emperor is cunning. Currently, the situation across the Myriad Realms is unclear. I sense that we are close to returning to the Myriad Realms. The Human Emperor might want to minimize our threat before that happens..."

The strong ones debated, yet they couldn't reach a consensus to launch an attack. There were many powerful beings and races present, making it even harder to agree.

For now, they chose to remain defensive, vigilant, and cautious, not giving the Human Race any opportunity.

...

Simultaneously.

Myriad Realms.

Upper Realm.

Ren Mountain.

Ren Mountain stood as always in the Upper Realm. At this moment, however, it trembled slightly. The figure of the Great Zhou King appeared instantly atop Ren Mountain. Seeing the tremor, his expression changed.

What was happening?

It seemed... the Human Emperor was summoning!

Ren Mountain wouldn't tremble easily. When it did, it meant the Human Emperor was calling. The Great Zhou King knew the Human Emperor's injuries hadn't improved. Was this a desperate gamble?

The Great Zhou King's face turned pale.

Su Yu had probably just arrived there, right?

Was the Human Emperor already preparing for a desperate fight?

At this moment, the Great Zhou King's expression changed repeatedly. This was not good news. Su Yu should also be aware of the dangers involved, and the Human Emperor should know that any mishap would be a colossal problem!

Yet, Ren Mountain continued to tremble, as if it intended to enter the River of Time.

"Is it time to return?"

The Great Zhou King murmured. The Human Emperor was still summoning, indicating a desire to reunite his spirit and flesh.

However, years of recuperation hadn't restored his body, and his sea of will was still severely damaged. Even if they reunited, problems would arise quickly!

And should he... go?

At this moment, the River of Time suddenly split open!

Ren Mountain shook violently!

It was about to leave!

The Great Zhou King's expression fluctuated, constantly changing. Logically, he should escort Ren Mountain, but... Su Yu had instructed him to guard the Myriad Realms.

Now, with Ren Mountain trembling, the river's waves were fierce.

In the distance, the Gate of Hell suddenly showed signs of trembling.

Could the river's turbulence be affecting the Gate of Hell?

If he left... and strong beings emerged from the Gate of Hell, what then?

At this moment, in the distance, Lantian's figure appeared, silently watching without approaching the Great Zhou King, just observing from afar.

Lantian knew a bit about Ren Mountain's situation. Su Yu had mentioned a few things before leaving.

Would the Great Zhou King leave?

Lantian didn't know.

He didn't want to know.

He only knew one thing: if the Great Zhou King left, it would be against Su Yu's military orders. Even if Su Yu spared him out of respect for the Human Emperor, the Great Zhou King would vanish from Su Yu's system.

Because, before leaving, Su Yu had entrusted the safety of the entire Myriad Realms to him, not Lantian.

The Great Zhou King was now the strongest guardian of the Myriad Realms!

And the Great Zhou King's expression fluctuated. The front line was in trouble, a major issue!

The Human Emperor wanted to summon his body back!

Yes, his body.

The Human Emperor's body was within Ren Mountain.

After the Human Emperor was severely injured, his body flowed back to the Myriad Realms along the River of Time. The Great Zhou King retrieved it and hid it within Ren Mountain, waiting for it to heal.

But even now, it hadn't fully recovered.

The Human Emperor was too powerful!

Even drawing from the entire power of the physical Dao might not suffice for his recovery.

Now, the Human Emperor was summoning his body. Should he escort the Human Emperor upstream?

The Great Zhou King was deeply conflicted!

In the distance, the Gate of Hell indeed showed signs of trembling. Would strong beings emerge as soon as he left?

Currently, the Myriad Realms still had Lantian and the Tea Plant, and Empyrean Cloud was close to becoming a ruler of laws. If one ruler emerged, there was hope, but if two or three appeared... the Tea Plant and Lantian couldn't hold them off!

It couldn't be that coincidental, right?

He kept thinking.

He worried about the Human Emperor's body encountering trouble midway. If something happened, the unconscious Human Emperor's body couldn't be stopped!

There wasn't much time left for him to think!

The entire Ren Mountain seemed to be floating, about to enter the River of Time!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King suddenly sighed, bowed towards Ren Mountain, and said, "Your Majesty... safe travels! I must... guard the Myriad Realms, guard the Gate of Hell... This old minister... cannot escort Your Majesty!"

He felt bitter. Was this a deliberate dilemma set by Su Yu?

At this moment, it truly felt like a conflict between loyalty and filial piety.

On one hand, the Human Emperor's body might encounter trouble. On the other hand, the Myriad Realms might face danger. He was torn!

With a long sigh, the next moment, Ren Mountain suddenly cracked!

At this moment, a golden body flew out from within Ren Mountain!

In that instant, the body appeared before the Great Zhou King. The Great Zhou King sighed, took a step forward, and merged with the body. In a blink, his aura surged!

Above the body's head, seven paths of the Great Dao appeared!

And above the Great Zhou King's head, two paths of the Great Dao appeared!

A total of nine paths!

And at the moment of merging with the body, a new path of the Great Dao suddenly extended between the nine paths!

With the fusion of both sides, the aura surged, and the understanding of the Great Dao deepened.

In an instant, another path of the Great Dao appeared!

Ten paths!

The Great Zhou King sighed again. At this moment, he was completely different from before.

Young, elegant, gentle, yet his body was robust, his aura powerful, shaking the entire world!

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly, grabbed Ren Mountain, and with a low shout, sealed Ren Mountain with paths of the Great Dao. The next moment, he sent Ren Mountain into the river, bowing once more, "Your Majesty, may you... achieve victory!"

Ren Mountain, guided by a force, flowed upstream along the river.

The Great Zhou King watched silently for a long time.

At this moment, he felt a bit empty... Was this the right decision?

Your Majesty, do you know that being by your side for so long has influenced me? Your path of responsibility has suddenly... taken root in my heart. The Human Race... legacy... responsibility...

Torchbearer!

I must pass on the flame of Human Civilization, so, Your Majesty, I cannot escort you back!

In the distance, Lantian saw his melancholic expression, his aura immensely powerful, and quickly vanished. At that moment, without Ren Mountain's presence, the Gate of Hell suddenly trembled.

Vaguely, behind the gate, the shadow of a giant beast appeared, and not only that, some human figures emerged!

They might be strong beings from the Control King's lineage.

The Great Zhou King frowned slightly. There was indeed a chance they could come out... Fortunately, he hadn't left, or the consequences would have been unimaginable!

The next moment, the Great Zhou King shot forward, arriving instantly before the Gate of Hell. He didn't attack but unleashed his aura, shaking the heavens, and shouted coldly, "Bold! Retreat at once!"

He had no intention of letting these beings out. Engaging in a battle without Su Yu present was too risky!

Behind the gate, the shadows trembled slightly.

A strong one!

A top-tier strong one!

Unexpectedly, the Myriad Realms still had a top-tier strong one. Clearly, some intelligence seemed inaccurate. Behind the gate, a cold laugh echoed, "It seems... that Su Yu... hasn't gone upstream?"

Clearly, those inside knew some details, but the intelligence provided to them suggested that Su Yu would go upstream.

However, there was a top-tier strong one stationed outside the gate!

The probe failed!

The next moment, the cold voice vanished, "Retreat!"

Soon, the shadows disappeared behind the gate.

Outside, the Great Zhou King's expression fluctuated. Tongtian's seal was too weak, and the Gate of Hell was already on the verge of opening. These beings might not need external assistance to emerge directly!

At this moment, he couldn't leave.

The Great Zhou King sighed, looking into the distance. Su Yu's world floated faintly, and the power within it seemed to radiate towards the depths of the River of Time.

A great war... might truly be imminent!

Otherwise, the Human Emperor's body wouldn't have left, and Su Yu wouldn't have so quickly drawn the power of the world over.

The Great Zhou King smiled bitterly. What a madman!

You've only just left!

You've probably just arrived there!

Why is the Human Emperor going mad with you?

Can a war at this moment really deal with the Myriad Races?

"Sigh!"

He sighed helplessly!

Looking again at Su Yu's world... The Great Zhou King hovered in the air, deep in thought. Should I merge the remaining eight paths into Su Yu's world?

Merging them would strengthen Su Yu.

But from then on, I, a ten-path strong one, would be completely under Su Yu's control!

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was also in a struggle!

Currently, with ten paths gathered, he was actually stronger than the Martial Emperor.

Not only that... At this moment, he also had other Daos that he hoped to successfully master. Over the years, he had cultivated far too many Daos! An unimaginable number!

Silence, space, endurance, sealing, breaking attacks...

Some Daos were impossible to break through, while for others, their masters had already perished, yet there was still a chance.

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was in a battle of mind and spirit. Perhaps he would soon step into an even higher realm! Maybe even... sixteen Daos!
