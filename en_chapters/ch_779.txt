Chapter 779: The Beginning of Resurrection, Will of the Dead

Death Realm.

Su Yu set everything aside, focusing intently on Hetu. Under his gaze, Hetu began to feel a mounting pressure.

"Your Majesty..."

"You will die!"

Su Yu's voice was soft.

Hetu frowned slightly. "It's fine. I want to try. I was a trailblazer of the First Tide. I don't want to remain trapped in the Death Realm, unable to leave! That tide should end with me! Your Majesty, I am a descendant of the Human Emperor, a peerless genius. I opened 360 acupoints and mastered the Zhou Tian Acupoint Technique. I once battled the powerful of the Myriad Realms... The First Tide should have me as its sovereign. It's just... I haven't lived as long as those old fellows!"

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "If you fail this time, you will truly die!"

"Your Majesty, I have already died once!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, merely reiterating the possible consequences. Since Hetu didn't mind, it was time to begin.

Su Yu's expression turned serious as he looked to the sky and said solemnly, "I will strip the source power from the Death Path. Liu Hong, you are responsible for guiding his death imprint back. During this process... there might be issues!"

He surveyed the surroundings and said gravely, "Everyone, remain vigilant! Additionally, South King and others... I might revive you all together!"

The crowd was taken aback. Why?

Su Yu explained, "A single success is better than multiple attempts. I worry... after one attempt, the Death Path will revive, and there won't be a second chance!"

This was Su Yu's greatest concern. Once the Death Path revived, the first attempt would have the highest chance of success. After that, there might never be another opportunity.

Upon hearing this, everyone became even more solemn. Reviving one person was different from reviving many.

Su Yu continued, "South King, Lanshan, seal your powers first! To prevent any issues with the Death Path that might drive you into chaos and cause you to attack us!"

The group of deathly strong beings exchanged glances and began sealing themselves.

Su Yu added, "Everyone else, exit my world! Keep an eye on South King and the others. At critical moments, I'm worried that sealing won't work, and the power of the path will drive them mad!"

The South King and others remained silent.

At this moment, a large number of strong beings flew out of Su Yu's world. Even Lantian flew out, his aura becoming more ethereal and somewhat powerful, though Su Yu had no time to investigate further.

Su Yu looked towards the sealed area, towards another region where Dragonblood Marquis and North King were present. These individuals were clearly also paying attention to his actions.

Su Yu's preparations for the resurrection of the dead were not a big secret due to the sheer number of people involved. The Death Emperor knew, and others knew to some extent as well. Moreover, the commotion would be significant, making it hard to conceal.

At this moment, Su Yu's aura surged, his voice echoing in all directions as he coldly declared, "I am about to revive the South King and other powerful beings. When the Death Path trembles, I hope you won't cause trouble for me!"

"North King, Dragonblood, Death Emperor, Dizhi Luo... I hope you will think twice!"

"Reviving the dead is also your hope for revival... Do not sever the last hope, nor your own deathly fate!"

"Those revived from the Celestial River of Death, whether lurking or hiding, I hope you hear this. Otherwise... today, in this Death Realm, I will unleash a massacre!"

Su Yu's voice shook the surroundings, a direct warning and deterrence! Without warning, some might not know what Su Yu was doing and could cause trouble, which would be problematic.

At this time, over a hundred auras shook the heavens and earth, intimidating all directions! With both the living and the dead, Su Yu's side had over a hundred Daofuse Realm experts! Truly a gathering of powerful beings!

As these auras surged, from afar, North King's voice echoed, carrying a hint of complexity, "Since the Human Lord wishes to revive the dead, it is indeed our light. We will not obstruct the revival!"

Whether they would or not, no one knew. But at this moment, they had to say so. Otherwise, Su Yu's side would not let it go.

...

At the same time.

Luminous Domain Mansion, at the entrance of the seventh floor, the Martial Emperor silently manifested another avatar, standing outside the passage, gazing into the depths with a mix of solemnity and hesitation.

Reviving the dead! This was something even the Culture King and others had not accomplished. Could Su Yu succeed? Despite the Death Realm's suppression and intimidation of the dead, there might still be trouble.

"Su Yu... is becoming more and more insane!"

He murmured, feeling increasingly that Su Yu was a madman, a desperado. He dared to do anything, capable of anything! What others dared not do, he dared. What others would not do, he did! This guy was crazy, gambling every time. He didn't know what reviving the dead entailed, yet he dared to do it. His existence was to do what others dared not.

...

At this moment, Su Yu's aura grew stronger, reaching its peak. Standing at the edge of the chaotic land, his aura became increasingly powerful, seemingly surpassing his previous state.

He casually patted Fat Ball, which obediently stopped biting and quickly flew away. At this moment, no one paid attention to Fat Ball.

Everyone's expressions were solemn as they watched Su Yu.

Suddenly, Su Yu acted.

With a low shout, "Open!"

The Heaven Gate opened wide!

At this moment, a massive Death Path appeared in Su Yu's eyes, seemingly right above him. However, it was also somewhat at the edge of this place.

"Open the path!"

With a thunderous shout, a loud boom echoed through the Death Realm, as if the sky had collapsed!

Vaguely, everyone saw an enormous path appear before them.

The Death Path!

"Manifest!"

Su Yu shouted, and at this moment, a large amount of death energy emerged from his body, not passing through the Heaven Gate but spilling out, seemingly trying to pull the entire Death Path down!

Previously unseen, the Death Path now seemed to officially manifest.

A massive path, spanning the entire world, appeared directly!

From all directions, the strong were shocked.

What was Su Yu doing?

Su Yu's aura grew stronger, the Heaven Gate hanging above his head, with death energy avoiding it, and rich life energy emerging from the Heaven Gate.

He stepped into the sky, his voice like a bell, "I will enter the Death Path to retrieve the source of your paths. I will manifest the Death Path for you all to see. Anyone who dares to obstruct me, kill them without any orders!"

"From the sealed area, if anyone dares to act, kill them at all costs, leave none alive!"

"I manifest the path for you all. Watch carefully. Any disturbance in the death source can be seen clearly. If there is any anomaly, leave none alive!"

"Yes!"

A unified shout echoed through the heavens and earth.

Over a hundred strong beings shouted!

The aura of Daofuse Realm experts surged into the heavens, shaking the heart.

There were too many strong beings!

And Su Yu, step by step, ascended into the sky, directly tearing open the Celestial River of Death, shouting, "Hetu, come up!"

Hetu's expression was solemn as he flew up.

At this moment, everyone could only hope for everything to go smoothly. There was nothing else they could do.

Su Yu led, Hetu followed.

The river split open!

Su Yu stepped into the surging river, the deathly waters crashing against the heavens and earth. Su Yu shouted lowly, the Starry Sky Seal appeared, suppressing the heavens, suppressing the river!

"Hetu, follow the source of your path!"

Hetu said nothing, following Su Yu into the Celestial River of Death, sensing with some solemnity, quickly flying in one direction.

And Su Yu, with the seal in hand, suppressed the river.

Preventing any energy from interfering with Hetu's search for the source of his path. In the Death Path, there were no branches. Everyone's path source was just a drop of water. Where exactly this drop was, they could only search bit by bit.

The entire Celestial River of Death seemed to be roaring and surging.

But when it reached Su Yu's side, it instantly calmed down.

At this moment, almost everyone could see the river, see Su Yu and Hetu within it, like a small boat in a giant wave, moving forward in this turbulent river.

...

Sealed area.

One by one, shadows appeared.

The Death Emperor looked up at the sky, murmuring, "The grandeur of the waves, the beauty of the path, beyond imagination!"

Perhaps, this was the first time in his life he could see the entire Death Path so completely.

Beside him, Dizhi Luo sneered, "Emperor, this Su Yu is extremely arrogant! Later..."

The Death Emperor turned to look at him, speaking calmly, "Dizhi Luo, brutes, warriors, wise men, cunning men, villains, strategists, all have their value! But among these people, the most feared is one kind. Do you know what that is?"

Dizhi Luo frowned slightly, quickly shaking his head, "I don't know, please enlighten me, Emperor."

"Fools!"

The Death Emperor said indifferently, "Brutes or warriors, it doesn't mean they are fools! Being foolish is a very frightening thing! Dizhi Luo, you've been with me for many years, or rather, after the seal, you became mine! Regardless, many years have passed. I hope you are a bit brash, a bit impulsive, but... I don't want you to be foolish, do you understand?"

Dizhi Luo's expression changed.

The Death Emperor looked at the others, speaking calmly, "If you want to die, you can cause trouble. If you don't want to die, be honest! It's not scary to die once. What's scary is that after dying once, you don't learn anything!"

"You've all lived so long, lived long before death, and lived long after death. Have your eyes gone blind with death?"

Outside, over a hundred Daofuse Realm experts, more than ten Heavenly Kings.

And beings like Su Yu and Fat Ball. At this moment, causing trouble, are you really not afraid of death?

There were many strong beings here, a total of 15.

At the same time, in the Celestial River of Death, Su Yu pressed forward, cutting through the turbulent waves. Hetu, who was beside him, was constantly sensing the location of his own source, his expression grave. Soon, he spoke in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, it should be just ahead! The Daofuse Realm might be even further ahead!"

Su Yu nodded slightly. If they went any further, they would reach the area where the Dragonblood Marquis resided. Hetu, being less powerful, should be closer to this point. Su Yu continued onward, and after a while, Hetu's eyes flickered. "Your Majesty, it's around here!"

However, Hetu found it difficult to pinpoint the exact location due to the overwhelming waves. Su Yu let out a low shout, and the great seal erupted once more, suppressing the turbulent waves. At this moment, within the river's waters, a massive droplet began to manifest, faintly revealing Hetu's visage.

Hetu's source of necromancy had been found!

Su Yu looked at the source, then at Hetu, and said in a low voice, "Try to merge this source into your body!"

Merge with the source?

Hetu thought carefully and nodded. He quickly dove into the river, and as soon as he did, he let out a piercing scream. A large amount of death energy began to corrode him, and even though he was a necromancer, he found it difficult to endure.

Su Yu frowned slightly and stomped his foot, causing the river of death energy to ripple away. With this disturbance, Hetu felt much more at ease and swiftly scooped up a droplet of water from the river. As he did, the entire Celestial River of Death trembled slightly, as if sensing something.

Or rather, it was the rule of the necromancer realm that forbade necromancers from retrieving their own source of power.

As Hetu grasped the droplet of necromantic source, a look of pain crossed his face. He gritted his teeth and said, "Your Majesty, this source seems... to be rejecting me!"

Su Yu quickly examined it, frowning slightly. He said in a deep voice, "It's the power of laws preventing it. Ignore it and try to force the fusion!"

"Understood!"

Hetu swiftly began to merge the source power into his body. As soon as he did, a massive wave of necromantic energy surged towards Su Yu!

Boom!

At that moment, even the Starry Sky Seal seemed ineffective, unable to suppress the enormous wave. Su Yu shouted, and the power of suppression erupted from within him!

"Suppress!"

A low shout echoed, and Su Yu's brows furrowed as he looked around. This sudden change upon merging was not a good omen.

Boom!

On both sides, more river water surged towards them. Meanwhile, Hetu was rapidly absorbing the power of the source. The droplet of river water was being consumed by him.

With this consumption, Hetu's power visibly began to rise. Originally, his source power was separate from his true form, but now they were merging. Previously, Hetu was only at the fourth-tier Daofuse Realm. As a necromancer, he had not advanced despite several insights into the Great Dao.

But at this moment, his aura surged significantly, reaching the third-tier in the blink of an eye.

Moreover, it continued to rise.

Hetu, however, was howling madly. Too much source power was flooding into him, and as he howled, he roared, "Your Majesty, the necromantic Great Dao had absorbed part of our power, which is now within the source. I have reclaimed it!"

Su Yu understood. This was the portion of power withheld by the Great Dao.

The Death Path differed from the Time Path. The master of the Death Path was more domineering, possibly having seized much of the power belonging to the strong entities of death to maintain the operation of the entire Death Path. After all, the death energy extracted from the River of Time might not be sufficient.

At this moment, Hetu was reclaiming his origin, essentially seizing the power of the entire Death Path. This could lead to resistance from the Death Path itself.

"Lock!" Su Yu shouted softly. Strands of the power of laws erupted, instantly manifesting in all directions, locking down the towering waves. However, his brows furrowed even more tightly.

Trouble!

Just one Hetu was causing such a big problem. What about the South King and the others?

At this moment, Su Yu could still hold on, and the problem wasn't too big. However, would this lead to the entire Celestial River of Death awakening? There were already signs of revival.

Would it summon back the Lord of the Dead Spirits? Or trigger some of the contingencies left behind by the Lord of the Dead Spirits?

Su Yu was in a dilemma. Should he let the South King and the others join now, or should he first revive Hetu and then think of a plan?

"I'm just afraid... there won't be a second chance!"

"But if they all come together, and one fails, then it's a total failure, and... and then it's all over!"

Such a decision made it difficult for Su Yu to make up his mind. Moreover, with more people, there was another problem: the pressure on him would be immense, terrifyingly so.

"Who can tell me what I should choose?"

Su Yu asked himself in his heart. As a decision-maker, he had to appear calm, confident, and nonchalant in front of others. But in reality, at this moment, Su Yu found it really hard to make a decision.

If he failed, only Hetu would fail. But if he succeeded, perhaps only Hetu would succeed.

"Damn it!"

"Annoying!"

Su Yu was very frustrated. He spoke lightly, but if the South King, Lanshan, Xingyue, and others all failed to revive, it would be a huge blow to him.

His inner struggle was something he couldn't show. At this moment, Su Yu wished someone would come and stop him, so he could make a decision to simply try reviving Hetu.

But at this moment, no one came to stop him.

It wasn't time yet!

Su Yu took a deep breath. After a moment, he made a decision. His voice was like a great bell, shaking the surroundings: "Those who wish to revive from the dead, come to me! Nine deaths and one life, choose for yourself!"

...

As his words fell.

Below.

The South King glanced at the sky, then at Lanshan, and smiled, "Shall we go?"

Marquis Lanshan also smiled, "Let's go!"

They knew that Su Yu hadn't revived Hetu yet. Suddenly calling everyone over probably meant something had changed. It didn't matter; they would go together.

Marquis Lanshan soared into the sky, laughing, "South King, do you think we can succeed?"

"Who knows!"

The South King laughed, and the two of them stepped into the air, flying upwards.

Moments later, below, several Daofuse undead also flew upwards. Xia Chen turned to look at the Great Xia King and smiled, "If I succeed, I'll come back and teach you, my unfilial descendant, a lesson. You've cursed me many times in secret! If I fail... carry on the legacy of the Battle King lineage! In the future, the Xia family will rely on you, and Longwu is also quite good. Xia Er is a bit lacking, but he must work hard too!"

The Xia family members all looked solemn and nodded one after another.

Xia Chen broke through the air, flying upwards. One by one, the undead powerhouses, some hesitating, some decisive, all flew upwards.

The Human Realm's Marquis Zhengyang, Marquis Langyun, and Marquis Fan Hai all flew upwards.

Several of the Culture King's students exchanged glances, smiled, and flew upwards, very excited.

They had experienced death once.

They hadn't experienced revival from death yet.

Nor had they experienced a second death.

...

At the same time.

In the distance.

A figure floated in the air. Xingyue looked up at the sky, saw Su Yu, saw Hetu, and then looked at the strong ones flying upwards. She also quickly flew upwards.

At this moment, nearly thirty undead powerhouses flew upwards.

There were Daofuse and also Eternals.

...

Even farther away.

Among the North King's group, suddenly, an undead marquis flew upwards. He also wanted to revive!

Revival, which undead wouldn't want it?

Su Yu didn't say it had to be his own people. Moreover, flying in now, Su Yu might not even recognize him. Yes, holding onto a glimmer of hope, he was too eager, even though he knew that this revival might lead to complete death.

The North King frowned slightly, "Revival... is just a legend. It may not really be possible. Everyone, don't act rashly!"

But in the sky, that Daofuse undead quickly flew towards the opening.

That was the gap Su Yu had opened earlier!

At this moment, many were watching. Instantly, several top powerhouses flew out from the crowd, and Su Yu also saw them. He suddenly shouted, "Do not obstruct! But let me make it clear, nine deaths and one life, even ten deaths and no life! Non-my-camp undead, if you want to revive, I will fulfill you, but you must be my vanguard. If you succeed, you will revive. If you fail, you will be the first to die!"

These words caused a slight tremor in the hearts of some undead.

Even non-Su Yu camp members could revive?

The next moment, in the vast Celestial River of Death, suddenly, a figure floated in the air, with a powerful aura, vaguely having the aura of a Heavenly King. At this moment, that shadow shouted, "I am Tianhuo of the Fire God Race, existing since the ancient times, willing to try once. Success or failure, it is my fate! I hope the strongest of the Human Race will fulfill me!"

Su Yu said loudly, "Come then, but don't cause trouble for me. Whatever I ask you to do... then do it, or I will kill you!"

"I will follow orders!"

That shadow soared into the sky, breaking through the air, and instantly drilled into the river.

At this moment, from all directions, nearly dozens of figures flew upwards, including Eternals and Daofuse.

On the North King's side, two or three undead marquises also gritted their teeth, bringing more than ten Eternals, soaring into the sky.

Life and death are fated!

Bet once more!

Marquis Dragonblood frowned slightly, looking at the North King. The North King also looked at him, saying nothing, but the North King had no intention of trying at this moment because the possibility of failure on Su Yu's side was extremely high!

...

Boom!

Everyone was watching. Among the strong ones flying into the sky, a Sunmoon undead instantly exploded.

In the distance, Su Yu frowned and shouted, "Sunmoon, don't come up. You don't have the power of laws. Are you coming up to die?"

These words caused some Sunmoon undead with some intelligence to retreat.

Sunmoon couldn't even go up!

The terrifying power of the river!

And the others quickly flew towards Su Yu's side. But at this moment, huge waves swept over. Su Yu's subordinates, supporting each other, had no major problems. Some Daofuse powerhouses could barely withstand it, breaking through the waves, flying towards Su Yu.

But some solitary Eternals were instantly shattered by the waves, their undead cores exploding, directly merging into the Death Path, completely dissipating!

These scenes frightened some undead powerhouses who still wanted to go, causing them to retreat in fear.

Solitary Eternals were very dangerous!

However, at this time, some remaining solitary undead exchanged glances, joining forces to move forward, breaking through the huge waves, flying towards Su Yu.

Carrying the hope of life!

...

Su Yu didn't take the initiative to go.

This was just a small hurdle on the path to revival. If they couldn't even withstand this, don't mention the troubles to come.

He looked at a figure in the distance, Xingyue.

Xingyue was only at the seventh stage of the Eternal Realm, yet she was breaking through the waves, not joining Su Yu's other people. Su Yu watched for a while, seeing that she could suppress those huge waves, and then stopped looking.

Beside him, Hetu's aura grew stronger and stronger. The entire undead origin was about to be completely devoured by him!

Seeing this, he was even approaching the second-class Daofuse level, progressing at a frightening speed.

And at this moment, Hetu's origin power suddenly disappeared, completely devoured by him.

And at this moment, a change occurred!

Boom!

A loud noise rang out, and the entire Death Path trembled!

In the void, a powerful will seemed to be awakening.

"Seizing the origin is not allowed!"

"I grant you new life... the origin is the price!"

That will in the void swept across the west, rapidly manifesting throughout the entire path.

At this moment, a powerful willpower surged in all directions.

It seemed to be the willpower left by the master of the Death Path, awakening.

He was telling all the undead that their second life was a new life granted by him!

Since they lived another life, they needed to pay the price!

Boom!

A massive entity transformed into a giant undead, striding with mechanical bewilderment, rumbling, stepping on the river, rapidly flying towards Su Yu!

Along the way, there happened to be a Daofuse existence, the first Daofuse powerhouse to fly out from the North King's side.

Before he could dodge, with a rumble, he was directly shattered by the giant undead's fork!

That giant undead was incomparably powerful, without any emotion, and continued to fly rapidly towards Su Yu!

...

"Undead will!"

Su Yu's expression instantly became much more solemn. He shouted in a low voice, "Everyone ahead, retreat! Quickly retreat!"

At this moment, there were still a few strong ones ahead, precisely the South King and the others.

The South King's face changed slightly, quickly pulling the others, breaking through the air, rushing straight towards Su Yu, ignoring everything else, charging straight.

Behind them, the rumbling continued.

That giant undead, holding a fork, continued to stride with incredible speed, running towards Su Yu!

Someone was seizing the origin, attempting to strip away his origin power.

This was not allowed!

It couldn't be!

The pillar of the Death Path was this origin power. Today you come to strip it away, tomorrow I come to strip it away, wouldn't that destroy the Death Path?

Rumble!

At this moment, that giant undead, sweeping with a massive wave of power, carrying huge waves, rapidly attacked!

From a distance, everyone already felt the crisis.

The South King and the others changed color!

A Heavenly King, even a Heavenly Sovereign!

This wasn't the reason for their change of color. The real reason was that Hetu... even now, was only a second-class Daofuse. What did that mean?

Representing that once an existence like the South King devours the origin, a master of laws might emerge!

The South King's expression changed completely. I... shouldn't have come up here!

No, perhaps it's better not to devour the origin!

Yes, don't devour it.

Otherwise, if a supreme being appears, Su Yu won't be able to handle it.

...

At this moment.

In the Sealed Land, the Nether Emperor looked up at the sky and sighed, "As expected!"

Indeed, it wasn't that simple!

Reviving just one Hetu, yet the Celestial River of Death has already shown such a change. This is only the first step of revival, devouring the origin, and there are more troubles ahead!

Beside him, a Heaven Sovereign-level existence also sighed lightly, "It seems the probability of failure is high! Just this one giant of necromantic will is already quite a hassle!"

The Nether Emperor nodded slightly, his eyes complex. "Before the Primordial Era, the Death Realm didn't exist. It was only in the late Era of Opening the Heavens that the Death Realm was established, created by the Lord of the Dead, granting us a second life!"

"Since we have received it, we must pay the price!"

"At this moment, Su Yu is contending with the Lord of the Dead for control over these necromancers. Even if the Lord of the Dead has vanished, he won't allow others to seize control over his Great Dao!"

With a long sigh, he saw no hope.

This is just the beginning!

Moreover, Su Yu still wishes to revive others.

However, if he doesn't revive others, and the necromantic will is disturbed, there might truly be no second chance.

"Will he give up?"

At this time, the Nether Emperor looked towards Su Yu in the void.

Su Yu stood tall, seemingly unprepared to compromise. He still intended to revive these people simultaneously.

Because Su Yu also knew that if he didn't revive them this time, who knows when the next opportunity would come. If he awakened some of the will left by the Lord of the Dead, there might not be another chance unless Su Yu could rival these wills.

"Then... let's go for it!"

Su Yu grinned, ready to give it a try!
