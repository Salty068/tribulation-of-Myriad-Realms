Chapter 775: Reaping the Benefits of the River of Time

Su Yu didn't meet with the Hundred Battle King; there was no need. The current situation actually aligned with his intentions. Although he had only exchanged a few words with the Hundred Battle King from afar, Su Yu found that he wasn't as unbearable as he had imagined. Of course, their ideologies were indeed incompatible.

Six thousand years ago, the Hundred Battle King chose to lie low under the protection of countless beings, a decision Su Yu couldn't accept. Su Yu had similar thoughts, but at that time, the Human Realm didn't support him, and as an outsider, he naturally wouldn't get involved. Once he entered the fray, even Su Yu knew he couldn't and shouldn't extricate himself.

...

Bringing the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King back to the Abyssal Realm, Su Yu once again gathered everyone, summoning the powerful figures.

Abyssal Realm. Grand Dream City.

Now, this place had become Su Yu's temporary palace. Of course, Su Yu didn't mind; any place would do as long as it was convenient for everyone to find him when needed.

Inside the main hall of the city lord's mansion, there were quite a few people. Su Yu didn't say much and straightforwardly announced, "The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King have decided to merge their paths with mine, to cultivate the path of cosmic civilization together. I won't elaborate on the pros and cons; you all should have some understanding!"

"I won't say much. Today, we will merge the paths of these two. Those interested can observe!"

Many in the crowd exchanged glances.

Soon, Heavendoom, who hadn't been too pleased lately, immediately asked, "Your Majesty, will merging with your path make us stronger?"

Su Yu smiled, "There's hope for those below the Heavenly King level. Above that... I wouldn't recommend it!"

Indeed, with Su Yu's current strength, he could at most support the existence of Heavenly King-level powerhouses. Merging with his path wouldn't allow one to advance further, nor would it enable one to become a Heavenly Sovereign. Even if one did, they would only possess the combat strength of a Heavenly King.

Hearing this, Heavendoom was somewhat tempted. He had recently reached the third-tier Daofuse Realm, but progressing further in a short time seemed unlikely. Hearing Su Yu's words, those below the Heavenly King level were indeed a bit moved.

However, everyone was aware of the drawbacks Su Yu mentioned. Su Yu's path was too weak. Unlike the stable paths of the River of Time and the Death Path, if something happened to Su Yu... it would be easy for things to go wrong, especially since there were still those in the Myriad Realms capable of dealing with Su Yu.

While everyone was still pondering, Su Yu didn't give them much time to think. He looked at Marquis Tongtian.

Marquis Tongtian, understanding the situation, instantly opened a portal.

Leading to the edge of chaos!

Su Yu stood up, "Great Qin King, Great Xia King, let's go. Those who want to see how it goes, follow along. This is the first time we're merging a true path with a pseudo-path!"

He even referred to his own path as a pseudo-path. Compared to the River of Time, his path was indeed insignificant.

The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King quickly followed, and others, one after another, also entered the portal to observe.

...

At the edge of chaos.

Su Yu's realm still existed. At this moment, it was visible. Between the Land of the Abyss and chaos, a small new world had appeared, slightly larger than when it first opened. However, it was still not much larger than a palace.

At this moment, there were people inside comprehending the pseudo-path. The source was the Human Lord Seal, which floated in the air. Su Yu didn't say much but extended his hand, and the Human Lord Seal automatically opened, revealing a faint image of Lantian, with countless avatars faintly appearing.

Su Yu tossed something inside and quickly sealed the Human Lord Seal. It was the ten thousand divine characters left by the Culture King.

...

Inside the Human Lord Seal.

Lantian suddenly opened his eyes, grabbing the light orb Su Yu had thrown. Upon closer inspection, his eyes flickered.

Divine characters!

Countless divine characters, each representing different rules and paths. Without needing Su Yu to explain, Lantian immediately understood. His eyes flickered as he looked deeper into the Human Lord Seal, where it seemed countless lines extended.

Lantian remained silent. This was something Su Yu could use himself. They were all on the path of myriad blades returning to one, so Su Yu could naturally use it too.

"Ten thousand divine characters..."

Lantian murmured. Cultivating the Great Dao, one must avoid owing favors. This favor was repaid, yet another came.

What should he do?

Use it or not?

Previously, to help Su Yu merge paths, his Great Dao was severely injured. First, he entered the Human Lord Seal to comprehend Su Yu's myriad powers. Now, Su Yu had somehow acquired ten thousand divine characters. If he used them, not only could his Great Dao heal, but it might even advance further!

"Sigh!"

A sigh, filled with melancholy, helplessness, and a hint of joy. Perhaps this is what it means to be a Dao friend. On the path of the Great Dao, they support and help each other.

"Forget it, why think too much!"

Lantian's smile was radiant, feeling genuinely carefree. The entanglement with Su Yu was growing deeper.

"In that case... I'll accept it!"

In the next moment, ten thousand divine characters floated. Ahead was Su Yu's foundation of myriad paths.

Lantian suddenly smiled, a playful glint in his eyes, "If you don't steal the power of myriad paths, I'll help you steal it! As they say, 'A sage never dies, a great thief never stops.' I'll be the thief!"

In the next moment, ten thousand divine characters floated in the air. All the divine characters suddenly connected to one person, all avatars of Lantian, though they appeared somewhat weak.

These avatars suddenly opened their mouths, swallowing the divine characters. Moments later, they digested the power of the divine characters. Then, one by one, they approached, seeking the corresponding path of Su Yu. After a while, these avatars connected with the source of the corresponding Great Dao.

All the avatars were then connected to a young Lantian. Subsequently, the young Lantian suddenly vibrated with his Great Dao power. Instantly, a faint power of the River of Time seeped through, channeling through Lantian's connection with the myriad paths, infusing a faint power of the River of Time into Su Yu's Great Dao.

Yes, this was also a method of stealing the Great Dao, stealing power from the River of Time. It was also a form of Great Dao fusion!

Lantian didn't sever his connection with the River of Time but acted as a link between Su Yu's Great Dao and the River of Time. This was different from the Death Path and the Human Emperor's Path. Their Great Dao powers were directly connected to the River of Time, while Su Yu's path was clearly not intended for direct connection. Lantian didn't mind being this intermediary.

If any issues arose with the River of Time, he could simply sever his Great Dao connection.

At this moment, two forces surged from Lantian's body. They seemed to transform into a black-and-white figure, one force from Su Yu, the other from the River of Time. The two forces intertwined, mixing within him, and then more power was channeled into Su Yu's Great Dao.

Countless Lantians looked up, smiling brightly. Cultivating the Dao is about having a clear conscience!

I have no regrets for anyone!

Of course, those fools like Wang Hu don't count; they brought it upon themselves.

I, Lantian, have never wronged anyone from beginning to end. The tenth tide will surely be victorious!

...

In the chaos.

Su Yu had just thrown the ten thousand divine characters inside when suddenly, an aura surged. In his eyes, the invisible power of myriad paths was instantly infused with more energy. There was no chaotic power upheaval, nor any special imprint of time power.

In an instant, Su Yu understood!

It was Lantian!

Just like before, he acted as a filter, this time serving as a filter between the River of Time and Su Yu's Great Dao.

At this moment, the power of myriad paths in Su Yu's Great Dao gradually increased. There was no obvious strength enhancement, but the power of myriad paths began to flow.

This had a significant advantage: endurance!

Yes, longer endurance, faster recovery.

Previously, Su Yu needed to slowly convert chaotic power, but now, Lantian had taken on this task. He directly stole power from the River of Time, helping Su Yu recover quickly.

The advantage of this was that it wouldn't allow Su Yu's Great Dao power to be assimilated by the River of Time!

Su Yu's eyes flickered.

Lantian!

Su Yu didn't stop him. Such actions had both pros and cons for Lantian. Enduring some pain was inevitable. The key was that the impact of two different Great Dao powers could cause Lantian's Great Dao to break if either side wavered.

Of course, this also helped Lantian comprehend two different powers of myriad paths.

He didn't mention it or bring it up.

At this point, saying anything would be hypocritical. Everyone knew in their hearts.

At this moment, Su Yu turned his gaze to the Great Qin King and others.

The Great Qin King, seeing Su Yu's gaze, nodded slightly, revealing a stiff smile, "Your Majesty, you may begin!"

Su Yu nodded and looked at Consort Qi, "Consort Qi has experience in merging paths. This is my first time. If you find anything amiss, please speak up to avoid mistakes!"

Consort Qi had completely transformed from her skeletal state, appearing noble and dignified, exuding an air of authority. However, when Su Yu looked at her, she quickly restrained herself, her expression solemn, and nodded, "Rest assured, Emperor Yu. If needed, Qi Rong will assist!"

"Thank you!"

Su Yu politely replied. In the next moment, the two powerful figures flew into that realm.

The power of the Great Dao instantly manifested!

The power of blades and spears shook the small realm.

At this moment, above this realm, a blade and a spear appeared. This was Su Yu's own realm, so he could naturally manifest the power of the Great Dao. The blade and spear appeared; in Su Yu's realm, there was only one blade and one spear!

"Both of you, hold your weapons!" 

Two formidable figures soared into the sky. The Great Xia King wielded a saber, while the Great Qin King held a spear. 

"Absorb the weapons into your bodies!" 

Su Yu commanded, and without hesitation, the two kings swiftly absorbed their weapons. As they did, a thunderous explosion echoed, and within their bodies, a saber and a spear materialized! 

The power of the saber and spear from different Great Daos began to clash subtly. 

Ultimately, there were still some differences! 

The West King's Consort furrowed her brows slightly and quickly instructed, "Transform your own Great Dao into the power of the saber and spear. Merge your Great Dao with the Dao of Emperor Yu. Emperor Yu's Dao will accommodate you both, but you must suppress the rebellious force of the Time Dao, find a point of harmony, a fusion point, and integrate the differences to prevent mutual rejection!" 

The two kings exchanged a glance. The Great Xia King chuckled, "Old Qin, let's see who can suppress this rebellious force first!" 

With that, two long sabers emerged from his body. 

"Merge!" 

The Great Xia King shouted, and the two sabers began to collide and merge rapidly. 

However, the repulsion still existed. 

The Great Xia King forced the merge for a while, then suddenly laughed, "Too troublesome!" 

Suddenly, both sides collided! 

"Your Majesty, strengthen the saber power within your Great Dao and forcefully devour it!" 

Boom! 

The twin sabers clashed! 

At this moment, in the unseen realms of the Myriad Realms, the River of Time trembled slightly. 

... 

Within the River of Time. 

The saber power that the Great Xia King had previously merged began to tremble. 

Then, streams of the power of laws seeped into the void, silently disappearing as if forcibly devoured by something! 

As the Great Xia King began to devour, the Great Qin King followed suit! 

In the River of Time, the spear power that the Great Qin King had merged also began to leak its power of laws, and once leaked, it could not return. 

In the River of Time, the myriad streams of power had a surge of saber and spear power merging into two Great Daos, filling the void of power. 

... 

Upstream of the River of Time. 

This time, the shadow felt nothing. 

But at this moment, someone seemed to sense something. Ahead, a powerful figure suddenly remarked with surprise, "My saber power is leaking..." 

"Leaking is normal, isn't it?" 

Someone dismissed it! 

Such a common occurrence, why mention it? 

The speaker was speechless, frustrated, "Nonsense, if it were normal consumption, I wouldn't mention it! The key is, I just felt someone merge into my Dao, then started extracting my Dao's power, and it won't return!" 

This statement surprised someone, "Did they fall?" 

"Not sure!" 

Who knows! 

If they fell, would the power dissipate? 

Generally, it wouldn't. Even if the power of the Great Dao shattered, it would return. 

This time, the power seemed not to return. 

Behind, the shadow fell into contemplation. 

The loss of saber power, what does it mean? 

Just merged into the Great Dao, then the saber power was extracted, clearly drawn away, but to where? 

The power of the Great Dao, aside from the saber power, cannot merge with other Daos! 

Unless... another saber power is drawing it. 

Is someone trying to merge saber powers? 

Great Daos can merge, similar types of Great Dao power can merge with the same type of Great Dao power. 

Thinking of this, the shadow murmured, "Could it be another saber genius, extracting your saber power?" 

The other might have taken a different saber path, now merging into this saber path, thus starting to extract power. 

But this situation, generally only a master of rules can do, and they must have a deep understanding of the Great Dao to extract another's Great Dao power. 

Everyone was puzzled. 

The Myriad Realms, recently, has had quite a few disturbances. 

The shadow pondered again, "Recently, the Myriad Realms might have some changes, perhaps our impending return has triggered some backlash from the Myriad Realms." 

For so many years, there hasn't been much movement. 

Recently, however, there have been disturbances one after another. 

Someone joked, "Your Majesty, could it be that the Martial Emperor has resurrected and is now extracting saber power?" 

"..." 

The shadow was speechless. 

Go to hell! 

Can we not mention the Martial Emperor? 

Others also laughed, and after the laughter, someone quickly said, "Your Majesty, can your true body still recover? I think, before long, we might synchronize with the time flow of the Myriad Realms!" 

Back then, His Majesty the Human Emperor led them upstream, blocking the powerful beings of the Myriad Realms in the past, ensuring the future Myriad Realms would not be disturbed. 

Over the years, the myriad races have repeatedly attacked, though they haven't broken through, they have severely injured the Human Emperor. Coupled with the natural flow of the River of Time, they are getting closer to the Myriad Realms. 

But now, the true body of the Human Emperor has not appeared for many years, the extent of his injuries unknown to both the human and myriad races. 

The shadow smiled, "Before returning to the Myriad Realms, I will naturally recover, no worries!" 

No one said more. 

Soon, someone else said, "Huh, my spear power has also been extracted... could it really be the Martial Emperor? Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental, just after extracting the saber power of the Battle King, now extracting my spear power?" 

Everyone was puzzled. 

This matter, only a master of rules could do, right? 

The shadow fell into contemplation again, after a while, he said, "Are they being extracted simultaneously?" 

"Yes." 

The shadow thought carefully, furrowed his brows, and said solemnly, "Could it be... true Dao merging with pseudo Dao?" 

"What?" 

Someone was puzzled, but the shadow was not certain. 

He had various speculations, but it was hard to determine without seeing it firsthand. 

"Could it be that my previous speculation, someone opened the heavens... is true?" 

"It shouldn't be!" 

The shadow's thoughts raced. 

He fell into contemplation. 

Meanwhile, someone suddenly said, "Your Majesty, our physical power has been declining over the years! Is there a physical Dao expert on the human side, devouring more physical Great Dao power?" 

It's been ongoing for a long time! 

But recently, it seems to have accelerated. 

"Physical Dao..." 

The shadow frowned again, "The devouring of physical power started long ago, you mentioned it to me before, I judged it might be an extremely strong physical Dao expert, expanding their control over the physical Dao!" 

"However, it stopped years ago, has it started again now?" 

"Yes!" A physical Dao king quickly said, "It started recently, actually it was there before, but not fast, I thought it was normal cultivation merging Dao, but recently, the speed has increased significantly! At this rate, we might weaken considerably!" 

The shadow's expression changed slightly. 

Others also frowned, "Is it the humans? Perhaps a human expert emerged years ago, slowed their expansion midway, and recently accelerated, Your Majesty, do the humans know we are returning, strengthening themselves to fight the myriad races?" 

The shadow was silent for a while, then said, "Possibly! King Ping, observe for a while longer, the physical Dao is not the only one, over the years, everyone has insights into other Daos, if it doesn't work, think of another way!" 

"Your Majesty, I'm worried the myriad races will detect our weakness... it's already tough, if we weaken more, the myriad races might launch more attacks!" 

"I will think of a way!" 

The shadow said, comforting everyone, but sighed inwardly. 

The power of the physical Dao is being invaded, which means, there should be an extremely strong physical Dao existence, devouring the entire physical Dao power, even trying to control the entire physical Dao. 

Is this good or bad? 

At least for now, it's not good for them, several physical Dao human kings are weakening, though they can still maintain the power of a master of rules, if more power is drawn, there might be trouble. 

"What exactly is happening in the Myriad Realms?" 

For years, there hasn't been any major change, now problems are arising one after another. 

... 

At the same time. 

In the Land of Chaos. 

Two powerful figures rapidly merged their powers, extracting a large amount of saber and spear power, merging it into the saber and spear Daos within Su Yu's world. 

Their auras constantly changed. 

A long spear and a long saber grew increasingly radiant. 

Among the myriad powers, these two Great Daos clearly became more robust. 

Beside Su Yu, Wan Tiansheng watched for a while, then asked, "The fusion seems smooth, Your Majesty, can they be self-sufficient?" 

In other words, when these two fight, can the power of their Great Daos absorb the chaotic power and convert it fast enough to match their consumption speed? 

If not, it would reduce Su Yu's endurance. 

Su Yu sensed for a moment, then nodded slightly, "They can roughly maintain balance. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King are not weaklings. At this moment, by strengthening the saber and spear Daos, the power they absorb should be enough for their self-consumption!" 

Wan Tiansheng breathed a sigh of relief, smiling, "That's good!" 

The fear was that these two would absorb too much power, weakening Su Yu, which would be problematic. 

As they spoke, the Great Qin King roared, his spear sweeping across the sky, causing the entire world to tremble. At this moment, in this world, the Great Qin King seemed to become the spear! 

He roared, "Old Zhou, come in and fight!" 

"..." 

The Great Zhou King was speechless, but Su Yu laughed, "Great Zhou King, go in and take a look!" 

The Great Zhou King was at a loss. 

After a moment, reluctantly, he flew in, entering that small world, and as soon as he did, boom! 

A loud explosion! 

The Great Qin King swept out with his spear, at this moment, he had almost merged with the entire spear Dao, in this world, the spear Dao was unique! 

And this world belonged to Su Yu. 

And to the Great Qin King! 

The Great Zhou King's expression changed slightly, he also struck out with a palm, but this palm was not as powerful as in other places, much less in the Myriad Realms, and was swept away by the Great Qin King's spear.

The Great Zhou King retreated repeatedly, a low growl escaping his lips as the power of endurance erupted from him. A flicker of hesitation flashed in the Great Qin King's eyes, but it quickly vanished. With a sudden burst of spear energy, he struck, causing the Great Zhou King's dao to tremble violently!

The Great Zhou King frowned once more. "Not bad!" he admitted.

In this place, it seemed the Great Qin King had the upper hand over him.

Suddenly, the Great Zhou King unleashed a formidable aura of his own. Unable to endure any longer, he decided there was no need to hold back!

He swiftly traversed through space, rumbling as he engaged in battle with the Great Qin King. His speed was astonishing, circling around the Great Qin King as he launched continuous attacks. The Great Qin King, wielding his long spear, relentlessly suppressed his opponent!

Gradually, the Great Zhou King was pushed to the edge of the world.

The more he fought, the more alarmed he became. This guy was truly formidable here.

He kept circling his opponent with speed, employing various techniques, while the Great Qin King was overjoyed. Here, he was actually suppressing the Great Zhou King!

Gradually, the Great Qin King fought with increasing ferocity!

Until the next moment, the Great Qin King suddenly withdrew, retreating. The Great Zhou King was taken aback.

The Great Qin King sneered disdainfully, "That's enough. Defeating you is sufficient. I won't bully you excessively; it's meaningless!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King was speechless!

Su Yu and the other onlookers suddenly burst into laughter.

The Great Zhou King's intention was clear: he wanted to drag the Great Qin King out of Su Yu's domain. However, this time, the Great Qin King didn't act recklessly. Instead, he stopped at the edge of the world!

The Great Zhou King was left speechless.

Damn it!

This bastard.

At that moment, the Great Xia King also laughed heartily, "Old Zhou, come, spar with me!"

At this moment, a blade path appeared, instantly merging into the Great Xia King's body.

The Great Xia King immediately raised his blade and charged at the Great Zhou King!

And the Great Zhou King, without hesitation, retreated beyond the world. Seeing this, the Great Xia King hesitated slightly, but in the next moment, he still raised his blade and charged out.

The moment he stepped out, the Great Xia King immediately felt something was wrong!

Indeed, within the world, he felt omnipotent.

But once outside, he instantly felt weak.

That sense of empowerment was gone.

Boom!

After the Great Zhou King stepped out, there was no difference; in fact, he felt less pressure.

Once outside, he vanished instantly, reappearing behind the Great Xia King. A spatial rift appeared in his hand, slicing through!

With a swish, the Great Xia King's clothes were shredded!

The Great Xia King turned and slashed, but the Great Zhou King disappeared again, silent and unseen. The Great Xia King's expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to leave, swish, a small sword pierced through the sole of his foot.

The Great Xia King let out a low growl, slashing out with his blade, but the Great Zhou King vanished once more.

In the blink of an eye, the Great Xia King was left injured all over.

Feeling dejected, the Great Xia King quickly retreated back into that world. Only then did the Great Zhou King leisurely reveal himself, smiling, "The world's number one, you and Qin Hao possess the power of a Heavenly King within His Majesty's domain, even with added empowerment, suppressing enemies. But outside the domain... at best, you're only at the second-tier Daofuse level. How can you match me?"

These two really thought of themselves as Heavenly Kings!

Not far away, Su Yu also nodded slightly, "Within my small world, you two are indeed true Heavenly King-level existences. But as I said before, once outside, you must downgrade! Unless you both step into the Heavenly Sovereign realm... or even... the realm of the Master of Rules!"

Everyone was taken aback!

Su Yu smiled, "What's wrong? Is it strange to become a Master of Rules? The Human Emperor has sealed part of the Time Avenue, and this isn't the Time Avenue! Becoming a Master of Rules isn't impossible! However, you will still be downgraded! Unless I can rival the Time Avenue!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was slightly moved, "Your Majesty means that by merging with this path, one can become a Master of Rules, but... but the Human Emperor's avenue power, even those cultivating pseudo-paths, are numerous... why..."

"The Human Emperor hasn't severed his connection with the River of Time!"

Su Yu smiled, "The power at the mouth of the Tianhe hasn't been severed yet! So, the pseudo-path strength of the Human Emperor's avenue is actually similar to true path strength. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, the Human Emperor's avenue hasn't opened much, only slightly stronger than mine here. How can it compare to true paths?"

"My side needs to downgrade, and even if the Human Emperor doesn't downgrade, it won't be equivalent to true path strength, at least half a level lower!"

The Great Zhou King was suddenly shaken, "Your Majesty means... the Human Emperor's path is inferior to... Your Majesty's?"

Su Yu laughed, shaking his head, "Not at all! It's just that the Human Emperor is unwilling to sever it, borrowing the power of the River of Time to perfect his avenue! Once perfected, he won't need it anymore, and the Human Emperor will naturally sever it!"

"My path is just too weak! So converting to chaotic power can barely sustain it! The Human Emperor's path is too strong, and the conversion speed isn't fast enough. The Upper Realm also lacks some chaotic power... This also leads to the Human Emperor's path consuming too much, with the consumption exceeding the conversion!"

Therefore, the Human Emperor hasn't chosen to sever it!

And the Great Xia King, at this moment, couldn't care about his recent defeat. He hurriedly asked, "Your Majesty means that within this world, we are truly Heavenly King-level, but outside, we're still second-tier Daofuse?"

"Yes."

The Great Xia King said dejectedly, "Then... can we carry this world with us to fight, or drag enemies into this world?"

Otherwise, it's too frustrating!

Su Yu laughed, "Currently, it's not possible. Of course, it can move within the chaotic region, but once outside the chaotic region, whether it's the Death Path or the Time Path, they will reject a new world!"

Su Yu's eyes glimmered, "Chaos is interconnected! Especially here, where chaotic powerhouses from the Upper Realm have visited before, so... my world can be moved to the Chaos Mountain region!"

Everyone was shocked!

If that's the case, doesn't it mean that the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, once at Chaos Mountain, can actually engage in true Heavenly King-level battles if they stay within this world?

Wan Tiansheng quickly asked, "Your Majesty... can this world expand rapidly? It's too small now..."

"It can, but I need to perfect the power of the avenue!"

After the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King merged into it, everyone could see that the world was clearly expanding. The strengthening of the blade and spear paths caused the end of the avenue to extend, covering a wider range.

The chaotic land ahead was visibly retreating.

Heavendoom didn't hesitate this time, immediately saying, "Your Majesty, if I merge my great club path into this place, can I quickly become a Heavenly King?"

Su Yu laughed, "Not necessarily! It still requires comprehension, but comprehension is simpler here because there's only one path! For example, your great club path... isn't it just the path of the staff? I have only one avenue power here. If you comprehend deeply, not just a Heavenly King, even a Master of Rules is possible! I will also actively open the avenue for you to comprehend... But if you're too stupid, even if I open it for you, and you can't comprehend it, there's nothing I can do!"

Heavendoom was dismissive. Would I be that stupid?

He was somewhat tempted. If he merged into this path and became a Heavenly King, even if he was downgraded outside, he would still be second-tier.

Moreover, this world was still being perfected!

During this process of perfection, there would be many insights and gains.

This was clearly a choice to follow the dragon!

In the early days of the world, comprehending the avenue should be the simplest.

Moreover, the path here was destined to have one advantage: no one controlled it!

The avenue, unique!

Except for Su Yu, no one else controlled a single path. Even the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, who controlled the blade and spear paths, others probably wouldn't choose them!

After pondering for a while, Heavendoom quickly said, "Your Majesty, I want to merge into it!"

He wanted to merge into the path!

Su Yu looked at him, and Heavendoom nodded, "I want to merge into this path. Once Your Majesty becomes the strongest, we will all rise with the tide! If Your Majesty can possess power equivalent to the River of Time, doesn't that mean we will directly become true equals?"

Su Yu nodded.

Heavendoom laughed, "That means, at that time, we can all take advantage of Your Majesty's opportunity to strengthen the avenue, rising like chickens and dogs! It's too difficult for us to comprehend the River of Time ourselves, and we're not even sure if our avenues have a Master of Rules! But here, we are unique! Now it's downgraded, and even if we become a Master of Rules, we may not match the so-called Heavenly Sovereign... But if Your Majesty becomes strong, we will be true Masters of Rules, won't we?"

Su Yu laughed, "That's the situation, but you must understand, maybe for a long time, I won't be able to do it. At that time, you might think you're at the Heavenly Sovereign level, but in reality, you might not even be able to compete with a Heavenly King. Won't there be a gap?"

Heavendoom grinned, "How could there be! Besides, I originally had almost no hope of reaching the Heavenly King, but now there's hope! This is also a shortcut. Those of us who merge into it can actually share Your Majesty's talent!"

Su Yu laughed, and at this moment, Grandstar and a few others suddenly said, "Your Majesty, let us merge as well!"

Everyone's eyes flickered.

This was indeed an opportunity!

It was also a gamble!

But as long as they won the gamble, they would occupy a place in this new world!

In the true sense, they would soar together with Su Yu!

Those who hadn't reached the Heavenly King realm were all contemplating.

Those who had reached the Heavenly King realm, Su Yu currently didn't want them to merge, otherwise, their combat power would be weakened. There were still very few who directly possessed the comprehension of a Master of Rules.

Su Yu glanced around and laughed.

"Alright!"

He no longer refused, laughing, "Since everyone trusts Su Yu and is willing to merge, let's pluck the wool from the River of Time and pluck it bald!"

With that, he laughed heartily.

One avenue after another appeared.

"Ladies and gentlemen..."

Boom!

Before he could finish, Heavendoom broke through the air, seizing the path of the staff.

And Grandstar, too, played dirty, kicking Empyrean Cloud away with an apologetic look, "Empyrean Cloud, there's only one sword path. You wait, I'll go first!"

Su Yu was dumbfounded!

Yes, both Grandstar and Empyrean Cloud cultivated the sword path, but... but you, this guy, are too ruthless, aren't you?

Empyrean Cloud was dumbfounded, and the next moment, he roared, "Bastard! How can you bully a woman like that? It's outrageous!"

While the two of them were still fighting over the Sword Dao, on the other side, the Great Ming King chuckled, suddenly stepping into the air. He laughed, "No one's competing with me for the Path of Formations. I'll play the role of a Heavenly King!"

Just as he finished speaking, Zhu Tiandao appeared instantly, smiling as he looked at his father. "Dad, give it to me. It's tough for me too. I've only just entered the Eternal stage, and you're already at the second-tier Daofuse. Why are you merging? Dad, you're getting old. Give the young ones a chance!"

The Great Ming King opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, and then cursed, "You don't need to walk the Path of Formations, you brat. Is your head filled with crap? With so many Great Daos, why are you competing with your father?"

"…"

Zhu Tiandao sighed, "Dad, I'm familiar with the Path of Formations too. The other paths... I'm actually not familiar with them!"

"…"

The Great Ming King felt like beating his son to death! This brat!

At this moment, a large number of people flew into the area.

Daofuse!

There was no need for Su Yu to say anything more. One after another, powerful auras rose, quickly beginning to merge with the Dao.

With this, Su Yu's world continuously began to expand.

At this moment, Su Yu completely relaxed. He looked at the Great Zhou King, who also smiled and transmitted his voice, "Your Majesty, are you satisfied?"

"Is this the result you wanted?"

"No."

The Great Zhou King smiled and transmitted his voice, "I was merely giving everyone a chance. Danger often comes with equal reward! Your Majesty, if we don't take any risks, how can we grow stronger? I would rather hear Your Majesty say that we shouldn't wait for the Human Emperor to return, but instead... take the initiative to attack!"

"I would rather see Your Majesty take the initiative to attack. That is the true Emperor Yu!"

Hearing this, Su Yu laughed.

Yes, perhaps this was the best choice!

Take the initiative!

Just like that day when I said we should take the initiative to attack the Upper Realm!

On this day, a large number of experts began to merge with Su Yu's world, reaping the benefits from the River of Time!
