Chapter 759: The Great Evacuation of the Human Realm

The Human Realm was in constant turmoil. Recently, the biggest news was that Su Yu planned to evacuate to the Death Realm. It was said that the Human Lord from the previous tide, six thousand years ago, might return. Large groups began to gather in certain areas.

In the Great Xia Prefecture, a weary group was heading towards Starfall Mountain. Among them were cultivators capable of soaring through the sky, as well as elderly and children who could only travel on foot, dragging along their families.

In the void above, a team descended. Xia Huyou looked down at the elderly dragging their families, ignoring the cultivators who could fly, and landed in front of an old man.

"Old sir!" Xia Huyou greeted with a warm smile, his chubby figure blocking the path of the family. "Are you heading to Starfall Mountain?"

The old man glanced at him, then at the people landing beside him. His expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly bowed, "This humble one greets the Prefect!"

He was about to kneel when Xia Huyou raised his hand, smiling, "No need for formalities, old sir. We're all citizens of the Great Xia Prefecture."

He continued, "Are you heading to Starfall Mountain?"

"Yes," the old man replied hastily, "We heard that Emperor Yu is going to the Death Realm. The prefecture has also sent word that those who wish to go should head to Starfall Mountain..."

Xia Huyou frowned slightly, "But... we advise ordinary people not to go. The Death Realm is dangerous, and leaving the Great Xia Prefecture, leaving the Human Realm, you might never return..."

"We know!" The old man, who had likely cultivated in his youth but never reached the Skysoar Realm, was now old and frail, his vitality waning. Despite his fatigue, he gathered his spirit to face the newly appointed Prefect.

The old man smiled, "We understand what the Prefect is saying! But... I heard the Xia family is leaving with Emperor Yu. If the lords leave, what will become of us?"

"We've followed the Xia family for over four hundred years. If they leave, the Great Xia Prefecture will have no master. Who knows how the new Hundred Battle King will treat us?"

"We've fought alongside the Xia family for centuries. We don't want to leave our home... but the future is uncertain. I'm worried... worried that the new Human Lord, the new Prefect, will target us because the Great Xia Prefecture is Emperor Yu's birthplace..."

Xia Huyou was taken aback, speaking softly, "Old sir, even if the Xia family leaves, we'll make sure everything is arranged. There won't be any problems."

The old man was anxious, "It's not the same. We're all Xia family people. The Prefect is high above, perhaps unaware of the people's thoughts... We don't want to leave, but we must. With the Great Xia King gone, the Martial Dragon Prefect gone, and you, Prefect Huyou, likely leaving too... once the Xia family leaves, the Great Xia Prefecture will no longer be the Great Xia Prefecture!"

Xia Huyou was stunned, "It won't be like that. I'll ensure the Great Xia Prefecture is well taken care of, and the Hundred Battle King will smoothly take over."

The old man wore a bitter smile, "Perhaps, but I'm not reassured. So... we'll endure the hardship and continue to follow the Xia family, follow Emperor Yu... even if the Death Realm is dangerous, it's better than staying here. The future is unclear for us, but we have elders and children at home!"

"My son is still a member of the Devil Subduing Army. He wrote to us recently, saying we should follow. With the Xia family gone, many in the Devil Subduing Army will leave too. Those who stay might not have good days ahead!"

"With a new ruler comes new ministers! The big figures are leaving, and the small ones... if they encounter trouble, they'll have no one to turn to!"

"Following the Xia family, at least we know they won't abandon us!"

The old man sighed several times as he spoke.

He didn't want to leave!

But the times were changing.

When Su Yu inherited the position of Human Lord, he was a part of this era's human race. Su Yu, the Great Xia Prefecture, and even the Human Realm knew him. His father was a soldier, and Su Yu himself had introduced many cultivation techniques.

Though young, he was known.

He was from the Great Xia Prefecture, from Nanyuan, with roots deep and true.

Regardless of his actions outside, for the human race, Su Yu had only eliminated some adversaries, like those from the single divine character faction. Since Su Yu's rise, he hadn't changed people's lifestyles.

Life had only improved.

A vast amount of resources had been transported back to the human race from the Myriad Realms. Source qi liquid, once rare, was now everywhere, sold at the price of cabbage!

Xia Huyou was slightly dazed, speaking softly, "So, old sir, you're saying that with us gone, the Human Realm... everyone is uneasy?"

"How can we be at ease!"

The old man said bitterly, "With no one to take charge, we common folk are at the mercy of those above. How will we eat and drink? My son is in the Devil Subduing Army. Will the new Human Lord see him as a remnant of the previous regime and kill him?"

"We served Emperor Yu, served the Xia family, and now they're old masters..."

He glanced cautiously at Xia Huyou, "I've heard the Prefect is tolerant. You won't be angry at my words, will you?"

Xia Huyou laughed, "Of course not. We're all citizens of the Xia family. How could I be angry with you?"

He continued, "Going to the Death Realm... might not be a bad thing. Take your time, old sir. There's no rush. I've arranged for military escorts. There are military personnel along the way. If you need help, seek them out."

With that, Xia Huyou soared into the sky, accompanied by many others.

He didn't speak, but quickly flew in all directions.

People were everywhere!

Masses of people were migrating.

Faintly, voices could be heard: "Let's all leave! If we don't, we'll be purged! The Xia family is gone, the Great Xia Prefecture is no longer the Great Xia Prefecture... A new lord is coming, and we're the old lord's people..."

"We're just common folk. We should be fine, right?"

"What about common folk? In the Great Xia Prefecture, who doesn't have a soldier in their family within three generations? We've all served the old lord!"

Xia Huyou flew on, seeing more and more such groups, feeling increasingly lost.

His expression changed repeatedly. After a long time, he turned to Ji Hong, speaking softly, "Director Ji, do you think... if we leave, these people will be implicated?"

"They won't."

Ji Hong quickly replied, "The Hundred Battle King is still the Human Lord. Even if he comes, he won't target ordinary people. Even if there's a purge, it won't be against these common citizens."

Xia Huyou's expression was strange, "But... they've lost their backbone! They feel there's no one to stand up for them, no one to support them! In the Great Xia Prefecture, millions have followed my Xia family for over four hundred years!"

"Not everyone can leave. If even one-tenth or one percent leave, that's already a lot!"

His expression was odd, "But those who remain, without a spiritual pillar, will they not fall into chaos?"

He grinned, "My Xia family has been rooted here for generations, and they have fought for us, sweeping across the heavens! Director Ji... what do you say... if we leave, what does that mean?"

Ji Hong's expression changed.

Xia Huyou seemed to laugh and cry, "I hadn't noticed this. My second granduncle didn't consider it much either. He didn't expect everyone to be so worried. It turns out, the Xia family and the Great Xia Prefecture have long been one!"

"Prefect!"

Ji Hong's expression changed. Xia Huyou was bitter, "I... I want to stay! I want to tell everyone, don't worry! My Xia family isn't leaving! We're still with you!"

"I want to tell the citizens of the Great Xia Prefecture that the Xia family is always here!"

"If the Hundred Battle King wants trouble, let him come for my Xia family!"

"If heads must roll, let it be my Xia family!"

"Director, I can't just abandon the millions of citizens in the Great Xia Prefecture... I can't do that!"

He grew more bitter, "Damn it! I thought I'd follow Su Yu, that my Xia family was his staunch supporter, that we were classmates, old friends, and that being a minister of the dragon would be good..."

"But thinking about it, I really can't leave!"

Xia Huyou sighed, "I know, if my Xia family goes to Su Yu, we'll be valued. This time, Su Yu will surely strengthen those who follow him..."

He knew that this time, Su Yu wouldn't let his followers remain weak.

Resources, benefits, everything would be tilted in their favor. Previously, to quickly strengthen his side, Su Yu prioritized the strong over friends and family.

But this time, it was different.

At this moment, Xia Huyou made a decision. No more sighing, no more bitterness. He looked at the migrating residents of the Great Xia Prefecture and smiled, "Director, these people are the foundation of my Xia family's unyielding strength! My Xia family, descendants of the Human King, my great-grandfather founded the Great Xia Prefecture to protect the people... not for power, but to safeguard them!"

He smiled brightly, "Very well, I'll stay! If the Hundred Battle King wants trouble, let him come for me! Even if he doesn't, I'll do my best to ensure the citizens of the Great Xia Prefecture live better lives!"

He spoke, smiling again, "And for others who want to leave, I... Director, I want to contact some people, for us to stay together! To protect the human race, to guard the major prefectures, to safeguard our foundation!"

"For so many years since the founding of the prefectures, the human race has had internal strife, but we're all our own people. Our own flesh rotting in the pot is still our own! The Hundred Battle King and his people are from the last tide, or even earlier!"

"They're different from us!"

Truly different!

At this moment, Xia Huyou made a firm decision. Not only would he stay, but he would also contact others to stay.

They would anchor themselves here!

Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.

Nanyuan City, Great Xia Prefecture.

Su Family.

The moment Su Yu stepped through the door into his home, he was greeted by the aroma wafting from the dishes on the dining table. Tossing his school bag aside, he walked up to the table and picked up a piece of red braised pork, popping it into his mouth.

While chewing, he glanced at the indistinct figure in the kitchen and said, “Dad, maybe prepare a soup tomorrow? It’s getting tiring eating meat every day.”

“Stop being picky. You should be happy to have something to eat.” Su Long’s grumbling voice came from the kitchen. “Also, you’re already eighteen this year. When are you going to learn to take care of yourself? I have been taking on the roles of both father and mother for you all these years. I’m finally going to get my freedom.”

Still chewing the piece of red braised pork, Su Yu smiled and praised, “Dad, your culinary skills are good enough that you’re almost a professional chef. I wish I could help in the kitchen as well, but unfortunately, all the food I make is inedible!”

“Heh,” Su Long merely smirked at the reply. Su Yu was all talk and no action. After all, he had never even tried cooking. With a height of 1.9 meters and a sturdy physique, Su Long looked rather comical dressed in a tiny apron that did not fit the image his powerful body projected. That had always been a point of contention for Su Yu, and it was the same today.

Shaking his head, Su Yu complained, “Dad, can’t you get a bigger apron? It’s not like we can’t afford it.”

“What do you know?” Su Long couldn’t even be bothered to answer the question. After placing the final dish onto the dining table, he sat down without taking off his apron. “Eat! We must save every bit of money we can. In any case, this apron is still new—”

“Dad, you’ve been saying that for the past three years.”

Su Yu rolled his eyes. Sure, it was understandable for his father to claim that the apron was new three years ago. But it was rather shameless of his father to still claim the same three years later. Su Long did not care about his son’s remarks. He started gorging on the food on the table.

Su Yu was already used to his father’s antics. He sat down and started eating as well. While eating, he sighed and said, “Dad, is the battle picking up at the front line again? On my way back, I saw the military recruitment truck downstairs. They must be here recruiting in our neighborhood. I wonder who’s going to sign up—”

At that, Su Long stopped eating. He placed his bowl and chopsticks down before solemnly saying, “It is everyone’s duty to protect one’s home and defend one’s country. Just listen to yourself. Are you trying to say that it’s bad to be a soldier?”

“Not at all!” Su Yu hurriedly explained himself. His father was a retired soldier. He definitely had to watch his mouth around this topic. After all, it wouldn’t be fun to be at the receiving end of his father’s palm that was the size of a bear’s paw. Su Long snorted before returning to his meal.

Suddenly, Su Long spoke again. His tone shifted into a gloomy one as he said, “Yu, the front line is in turmoil. The various armies have been recruiting repeatedly. New soldiers are constantly being recruited while veterans are being recalled.”

Su Yu was in the midst of eating when he paused and looked up at his father. His attitude changed completely as he frowned and asked, “Dad, that has nothing to do with us, right? You have been retired for eighteen years and I’ve just reached adulthood. Also, I’m applying for the high academies. The recruiters won’t come to us.”

“It has been eighteen years…” Su Long sighed. Yes, it had been eighteen years. “During the past eighteen years, the Devil Subduing Army has recalled retired veterans five times. After reaching fifty years old, I won’t be fit to be recalled any longer. During the previous four recalls, you were too young. I was worried about you so I did not answer the recalls.”

Su Yu’s expression changed rapidly as he said, “Dad, our family can be exempted from joining the army! The policy allows this!”

“Yes, the policy allows this!” Su Long grinned. He raised his head and gazed at his son before saying, “Therefore, I’ve not been answering the recalls. In the past eighteen years, there have been four recalls apart from the current recall! I’ve not answered any of them! But now, my son has finally reached adulthood! He is now eighteen!”

“Dad!” Su Yu had an ugly expression. “What are you trying to say?”

“You know what I’m trying to say.” Su Long gazed at his son with a gratified and satisfied expression. He smiled and said, “Your dad might be useless, but eighteen years ago, he was a platoon leader in command of thirty soldiers. At the time, your mom was on the verge of giving birth, so I requested for a leave of absence and returned. Who would have guessed that your mom would leave this world just like that. You were a newborn and we didn’t have anyone else in the family to take care of you. I couldn’t leave, so I was forced to retire from the army.”

Su Long had a bitter smile on his face. “When I left, not a single one of my comrades saw me off. No, it wasn’t that they wanted me gone, but they were afraid that I wouldn’t be able to leave after seeing them. It has been eighteen years. Not one of them has tried contacting me. They’re all afraid that I wouldn’t be able to resist returning. Even in my dreams I can see them shouting at me to return home and take care of my baby. Of my thirty brothers, nine were killed on the battlefield the first year after I left. Not one of the surviving members has left the army. Do you know what the remaining twenty-one of them are doing? They’re all still on the battlefield right now!”

Tears started welling in Su Long’s eyes. “I was selfish, so I didn’t dare to ask about them. I had not responded to the previous four recalls. But this time…Yu, if your dad has to die, he would rather die a soldier on the battlefield. Your dad does not wish to die behind the front line!”

Su Yu sank into silence. He was aware that his father had never forgotten the front line and the old comrades there. If his mother had not passed away during childbirth back then, his father would never have retired from the Devil Subduing Army. He had always thought that eighteen years would be enough for his father to forget and let go of the past. Today, he learned that his father had not forgotten about the past after all.

“Dad…” Su Yu paled as he persuaded, “The front line is in turmoil. The number of casualties among our soldiers are only getting higher and higher. In the past eighteen years alone, the army had recalled retired veterans five times. In short, a recall was made once every three to four years. You used to be a soldier. You know very well what that means. I’m still single. I still haven’t entered a high academy. I still haven’t gotten you a grandchild…”

Su Long grinned, “It’s fine. I’ll be waiting for all that! What? You think I’m going to be throwing my life away on the battlefield? No! I’m there to win the war!”

“Dad!”

“Cut the crap, kid! Eat your meal!” Su Long cut his son off. While eating, he mumbled, “After this meal, you’ll have to start preparing your own meals. If you can’t cook, go eat outside. Use the money in my card. You know the password. They’re still waiting for me downstairs. I need to make this quick. Remember to mail me a letter after passing your academy entrance exam. I’ll be reading your letters during my free time. You’ll be getting into a cultural research academy. Your old man is very proud of you, you know that? You’re practically guaranteed a spot in a cultural research academy already. Your teacher told me that barring anything unexpected happening, you’ll definitely be able to join one. A talent is finally going to emerge from our Su family! I do wonder sometimes. How exactly have you grown that brain of yours? You’re way too smart. I used to wonder if you’re actually my son. Fortunately, you greatly resemble my younger self in appearance.”

Su Yu had a pale complexion at the realization that his father was about to step into the battlefield. Nevertheless, he still couldn’t stop himself from challenging that claim, “Dad, are you sure I look like your younger self?”

“What bullshit question is that? That’s the truth!” Su Long looked up, revealing his rough face and grinned, “Feel free to ask our neighbor if you doubt me!”

Su Yu was speechless. He knew that his father was trying to shift the topic, so he returned to the previous topic, “Dad, must you go? It’s not that I’m looking down on you, but it has been eighteen years since you left the battlefield. You haven’t been cultivating much either. Even now, you’re still at the ninth-stage Great Strength Realm. Will you even be helpful on the battlefield?”

“Who are you looking down on?” Su Long said furiously, “So what if I’m only at the ninth-stage Great Strength Realm? Strength is not the only thing that matters on the battlefield. Otherwise, wars would be pointless. Everything is possible on the battlefield. I’ll have you know that I once killed an Infinite Strength Realm expert when I was only a seventh-stage Great Strength cultivator.”

Su Yu was still very distressed. He had no idea if that story was true, but his father had repeated the story for many years. It was highly probable that his father was telling the truth. However, he did not want his father to go to war. The front line was very chaotic. Every single year, a large number of soldiers would die there. The situation there was only getting more and more dangerous. His father was nearly fifty years old. Su Yu didn’t even dare to imagine what it would be like for someone like that to return to the battlefield.

“Dad—”

“Shut up!” Su Long interrupted his son. He stood up and put the dishes away before saying with a solemn expression, “I’ve signed myself up. If I don’t show up, I’ll be considered a deserter. It’s fine if I don’t show up before signing up, but you know the consequences for not showing up now. A deserter will be executed!”

“Dad, couldn’t you have waited for me to come back and talk about this before signing up?”

Just thinking about it made Su Yu furious. He knew that there was nothing he could do to change this. His father was right. It didn’t matter before signing up. The recall order was not compulsory. All these veterans who had retired alive were people who had contributed to the army during their time on the battlefield. But upon signing up, one would be considered a soldier yet again. Not showing up after that would cause one to be labeled a deserter.

“What is there to talk about?” Su Long said dismissively, “Don’t worry. I won’t die. Even if I do end up dying, you will be eligible for a nice compensation. Don’t forget to claim it if I end up dying. That will be enough money for you to get a wife and raise a child. See, your old man has everything planned for you!”

Then, Su Long removed the apron from his body and picked up the backpack that he had packed earlier, behaving as casually as someone leaving for a short trip. “Do well in your exam. People like you who are supporting humanity behind the front line are just as important. Perform well in the cultural research academy and bring glory to our Su family. Cultural research academy…yes, I’ll need to tell everyone about that after returning to the army. I have a son that has managed to enter a cultural research academy. That’s far more incredible than their children. It’s a pity that I won’t be here to see your acceptance letter. Remember to snap a picture of the letter and mail it to me. I need proof or those fellows will think that I’m merely bragging.”

“Dad!” Su Yu stood up and ran after his departing father in panic. His father was really going to leave. He had been used to living with his father for the past eighteen years. He was not mentally prepared for this sudden departure.

“You’re all grown up now. Don’t cry like a little boy.” Su Long grinned. “If you’re still a child, I won’t leave. But now that you’re an adult, I must go. When I left eighteen years ago, there were several kids as old as you currently are in the platoon. Yu, do you know? I dreamed of them. They were crying in pain in the dream, telling me to kill all those animals. I regret my decision to not send you to the Military House of Dependents back then. After all, there would still be someone looking after you while I’m in the army if I did.”

Su Long teared up. “This is the fifth recall. During the previous four recalls, I had my luggage packed up every single time. But every time I laid my eyes on you, I selfishly stayed behind. I couldn’t bring myself to leave. This is the fifth time! Will there be a next time for me? I’ll probably be over fifty by then and the Devil Subduing Army will no longer accept me! It is time for me to go. The Allheaven Battlefield is waiting for me. Just you watch. I’ll kill a few Infinite Strength Realm experts this time and keep the evidence. You won’t be able to doubt me anymore after that.”

Then, Su Long waved his hand and walked away. This was the very first time Su Yu had seen his father this carefree and heroic in his eighteen years of life. However, this wasn’t something he wanted to see.

“Dad…”

“I told you to cut the crap.”

Standing before the door, Su Yu clenched his teeth and shouted, “If you fail to return, I’ll become a live-in son-in-law! I’ll change my surname and sever the inheritance of your Su family! If you really don’t care, trust that I’ll really dare to do so as well!”

“I—” Su Long staggered and nearly turned around to unleash profanities at his son. He suddenly had the urge to stay behind and beat up his son. He knew that his son would really be capable of doing something like that. It hadn’t been easy for the Su family to finally give birth to a talented individual like Su Yu. He definitely wouldn’t be able to accept such a talent marrying into someone else’s family.

King of Shang bellowed, "If His Majesty wishes not to return and only desires to flee the Human Realm, shedding its burdens to fight unencumbered... then we shall fulfill His Majesty's wish. Today, we will choose a new Human Lord. We may submit to Hundred Battle, but we will not pledge our hearts! We are willing to stand alongside Hundred Battle, but we will not acknowledge him as the Human Lord! If no one else is willing, this old man will take up the mantle!"

He volunteered himself to be the Human Lord. It wasn't about seizing power; it was to tell Su Yu that if he didn't want to return, they wouldn't follow him.

Su Yu remained silent, gazing at the millions of hopeful eyes. He could see their desire. They wanted to fight back!

On the periphery, over ten million soldiers suddenly knelt. A Sunmoon Realm expert soared into the sky and shouted, "Your Majesty, Emperor Yu, this old servant Wu Ji! If Your Majesty does not wish to return... we will remain in the Human Realm and continue to battle on all fronts! Our Human Race has conquered the myriad races. If Hundred Battle returns, will he continue? Will he choose to hibernate? Or something else?"

"Will the grudges remain unresolved, the myriad races unyielding? Once Hundred Battle departs... will we witness the tragedy of the myriad races attacking the Human Race again?"

"Over four hundred years ago, the myriad races invaded, and our Human Race paid a bloody price to expel them... Today, we refuse to let history repeat!"

"Your Majesty, will you fight back?"

"Will you return?"

The cries echoed through the heavens and earth.

Will you return?

If you do not... we will not leave!

This is our homeland, our native soil.

Su Yu looked around, momentarily at a loss.

Will I... return?

I left the Human Realm to shed its burdens. I thought taking these people with me would be enough, that they wouldn't lack food or cultivation resources. Following me, they wouldn't suffer.

Yet... everyone was asking him, will you return?

Su Yu was silent for a moment, then softly said, "I am not taking everyone directly to the Death Realm. Instead, we will settle in the Abyssal Realm. The reformed Abyssal Realm is much like the Human Realm, not as the legends say, dealing with the dead."

"But it's not our homeland!"

King of Shang shouted, "If we had wanted, we could have taken our people and retreated to other realms back then! Yet, for over four hundred years, we never did, no matter how dangerous the Human Realm became!"

"Because this is where we were born and raised!"

"We fight for this land, for the Human Race on this land!"

"Our ancestors lived here for generations. This is our homeland, our roots!"

King of Shang said solemnly, "Throughout history, no race that abandoned its own realm has met a good end! Wandering without roots, losing cohesion, losing the glory of the race... Years later, will we change our race? Will we become the new Abyssal Race?"

"This is not the outcome we desire!"

"Perhaps His Majesty thinks this old servant is finding fault... Yes, I am finding fault!"

His hair and beard bristled, "I just want to ask, is His Majesty abandoning this homeland?"

"......"

At this moment, Su Yu found himself unable to respond. He could easily crush this man with a slap, but... he couldn't bring himself to do it.

His expression fluctuated, and he remained silent.

At that moment, Xia Huyou soared into the sky, looking at Su Yu with a complex expression, "Xia Huyou of the Great Xia Prefecture wishes to remain in the Great Xia Prefecture, to consolidate the empire for our emperor! No matter how strong Hundred Battle is, he is not our emperor! The Human Race of six thousand years ago... can be generals, commanders, vanguards, honored guests... but not the lord!"

"We are willing to stay with the Human Race, to consolidate the empire of the Human Race!"

At this moment, dozens of experts soared into the sky.

They shouted loudly!

We are willing to stay with the Human Race!

Even if it's dangerous, even if we face retribution!

Su Yu remained silent.

Beside him, Zhu Tiandao's eyes flickered, and the Great Han King also had a complex expression. The next moment, he shouted in a low voice, "Nonsense! King of Shang, what are you trying to do?"

"Nothing!"

King of Shang coldly said, "We just want an answer! Even if... even if Emperor Yu deceives us with a lie, saying he is willing to fight back, for a thousand years, ten thousand years, we are willing to wait!"

"We just don't want... to give up!"

"Now that Hundred Battle has returned, should we hand over the Human Race we fought to protect with our lives?"

King of Shang roared, "Where were they over four hundred years ago?"

"My comrades died on the battlefield, where were they?"

"And now, they've returned. Is the Human Race of six thousand years ago the same as the Human Race now?"

"They have no relatives, no friends, no brothers here! They are merely passersby! They are alone!"

"The Ninth Tide and the Tenth Tide are too isolated!"

King of Shang shouted loudly, "Unlike the previous nine tides, where the legacy continued, the bloodline continued! In the previous nine tides, a large number of experts, ancient experts, and experts from the previous tide were all present! In the previous nine tides, they were truly one! They passed down from master to disciple, their bloodlines continued without end. Except for losing a Human Lord, there was no difference!"

"But are we the same?"

He was furious, "We are not the same! Why deceive yourself, Your Majesty? We are completely different! It's like a foreign race, strangers, with no difference! In Hundred Battle's eyes, the Human Race are subjects, and perhaps other races are too... It's said that Hundred Battle loves his people like his children, but he loves the subjects who fought alongside him six thousand years ago! Perhaps among those people are his teachers, his students, his brothers, his lovers, his comrades, his children... What does the current Human Race have to do with him?"

"Nothing!"

He roared, he raged.

Su Yu became the Human Lord, and everyone reluctantly accepted it.

Su Yu's father is here, his teacher, his friends, his elders, his classmates, his confidants... they are all here!

They are all Human Race!

They are all from this tide of the Human Race!

Su Yu is inseparable from the Human Race.

Can he let go of the Great Xia Prefecture?

He cannot!

Can he abandon the Great Ming Prefecture?

He cannot!

Can he watch the Great Qin Prefecture fall?

He cannot!

Thus, he can become the Human Lord, even if everyone is dissatisfied with him, even if everyone thinks he doesn't look like a Human Lord, but they can still accept it.

Hundred Battle... those who truly understand will not accept it.

Who would accept someone with no relatives, no friends, no family, no teachers, no comrades, no brothers to protect this Human Race?

Impossible!

When war breaks out, what does the life and death of the Human Race have to do with Hundred Battle?

Perhaps in Hundred Battle's eyes, if hundreds of billions of the Human Race die, and 99 billion remain, that's enough for reproduction!

As long as they don't all die!

One by one, the experts looked at Su Yu.

Will we return?

Countless pairs of eyes looked at Su Yu, will we go home?

When the situation is unfavorable, we are willing to retreat. After all, no one is undefeated for life.

But we want to go home.

...

In the air.

Su Yu wanted to speak, he wanted to say, I won't return!

Is it so good here?

Leave it to Hundred Battle, that's my plan, I left you all, and I feel unburdened.

I have no shackles, I feel great!

But... but he seemed to have overlooked something, will Hundred Battle treat this tide of the Human Race kindly?

Will he consider these people his kin?

Will he, like the Great Qin King and others, sit atop the Eastern Rift Mountain, guarding against enemies from all sides?

Will he keep the enemies outside, not allowing the myriad races to step into the Human Race?

Hundred Battle seems to trust the Ancient Giant Race more, right?

In the last tide, he feigned defeat. If at that time, the Upper Realm had closed a bit slower, the Allheaven Battlefield had closed a bit slower, without the Great Zhou King, without Xia Chen, could the Human Race have resisted the invasion of the myriad races at the beginning of this tide?

Did Hundred Battle... abandon them?

This question, Su Yu seemed to have overlooked.

In the last tide, he could abandon them, so what about this tide?

Su Yu was bewildered, how should he answer them?

Even Xia Huyou, whom he thought would definitely follow him, stood up at this moment, telling him he wouldn't leave, he would stay to protect the Human Race, he would live and die with the Human Race!

He didn't recognize that Hundred Battle!

He saw the Great Qin King's Qin Hao, that fool-like guy, with a serious expression, he wouldn't leave either, he would protect this land, shelter the Human Race here!

He saw Zhu Guangshen, who liked to laugh and joke, he also said he wouldn't leave.

He wanted to stay here, he was worried that Hundred Battle wouldn't truly care for the Human Race.

No one questioned Su Yu about this because everyone knew Su Yu couldn't let go.

Su Yu's expression changed unpredictably.

He turned to look at Marquis Xia and the others, at Zhu Tiandao, who had always supported him. At this moment, Zhu Tiandao still wore a smile, looking at Su Yu. Seeing Su Yu look over, he smiled and said, "Your Majesty, we... will fight back, won't we?"

Temporary gains and losses don't matter.

If we lose the territory, we'll take it back, even if hope is slim, but we... hope for a spiritual pillar.

Su Yu looked around, among the crowd, there were elderly people with some expectations, as if saying, as long as we are willing to fight back, no matter how much suffering, even if we enter the Death Realm, it doesn't matter!

Otherwise, even if we go to enjoy life... we won't be at ease, we won't be content!

Humans have a special affection for their land, for their homeland!

It's hard to leave one's homeland!

"Do you all... want to fight back?"

Su Yu murmured.

"Yes!"

At this moment, someone answered him.

Marquis Xia.

At this moment, Marquis Xia was no longer smiling, nodding, "We want to fight back! Emperor Yu, this is our home! Today, we can give it up, but we want to come back! If this generation can't, then the next! If the next can't, then the one after that!"

"We just fear that Emperor Yu has no such intention, and from now on, we will never have the chance to return home!"

In the distance, Liu Wenyan's expression was complex. "We all want to return! But we also wish to follow you! Following you is a sign of trust, yet wanting to return is our spiritual anchor! Leaving one's homeland is not like moving from the Great Ming Prefecture to the Great Xia Prefecture... it's leaving the Human Realm for another world!"

If it were merely moving within the Human Realm, it wouldn't be a big deal. But today, they were heading to another world! That place would no longer be home. It wasn't the same sky, nor the same land.

Su Yu closed his eyes, lost in thought. What about me? Have I ever thought about coming back?

Just as he was deep in thought, someone suddenly stepped out from the crowd, removing their hat to reveal their true face.

Su Long stepped into the air, looking at Su Yu, and shouted, "Have you never thought about coming back? Do you see the Human Race as a burden? If so... you can leave on your own! This is our home! Look back, that's Nanyuan! Years ago, I chose to rejoin the army, not to fight for the Xia family, but for my home, for my son!"

"Su Yu, the Human Race is not a burden! You can ignore it, you can run if you can't win, but... you can't take everyone away and not bring them back!"

"Millions of people trust you, they follow you, they are willing to advance and retreat with you... but they are humans!"

Su Long angrily asked, "Have you ever thought about whether to come back? If not... you can leave on your own! Whoever wants to go with you can go! We want to stay! We don't want to be asked decades or centuries later, 'Do you know what the Human Race is? Do you know where the Human Realm is?'"

Su Yu looked at his father. He had long known his father was here, thinking he would follow him in the retreat. But now, his father stood up and told him, if you want to leave, then leave!

At this moment, Su Yu felt a bit lost. It turned out... what I thought was different from everyone else. I thought I would lead you into a new era, not necessarily in the Human Realm. I would provide you with the best resources, the most generous treatment, allowing you to avoid battles and live in peace...

But... is that not what you want?

Su Yu softly said, "If we fight back... fighting back might mean joining the battle, and countless people might die! Here, fifty million people follow me, Su Yu. If I have food to eat, no one will starve. We can peacefully watch the Myriad Races battle... no one will die, at least not too many."

The Great Shang King angrily retorted, "Are we afraid of sacrifice? Those who rose with me to resist, how many are left now? If they were afraid of death back then, if they were willing to live ignobly, they could have easily found a small realm to hide in and wouldn't have died!"

"We have selfish desires, we are selfish, we crave power, we are vain, we fight openly and secretly... but we have never retreated! If you take an inch of our land, we will take it back!"

At this moment, Su Yu felt a sense of loss, a bit dazed. After a long time, he sighed softly, "So that's how it is! Everyone... wants to fight back, is that it?"

"Exactly!"

Su Yu smiled bitterly, "I just thought, Hundred Battle is also part of the Human Race, he wouldn't treat everyone too harshly. I didn't mean to say that if the Human Race is destroyed, I wouldn't care. I just... just thought..."

Su Long scolded, "That's just what you think! Hundred Battle... who the hell knows Hundred Battle? I don't know him! I only know you, you're my son, you're the Human Lord chosen by everyone! Even if you're unreliable, your father is here, your teachers are here! Even if you have no conscience, you wouldn't abandon your father! But that Hundred Battle, do you think he cares about any of this?"

Su Long reprimanded, "Today, in front of everyone, I'm asking you, if you leave, will you fight back? If you don't plan to fight back, then just get lost!"

Su Yu chuckled, then suddenly smiled brightly, "So, everyone actually thinks I'm more reliable than Hundred Battle, right?"

"......"

This was a difficult question to answer, but soon Zhu Tiandao laughed, "Of course! After all, you're someone we've watched rise step by step within the Human Race, a fellow race member, a comrade, a brother-in-arms! During the Battle of Nanyuan, you put in so much effort! In the Luminous Domain Mansion, you risked exposure to save the Great Qin King! You killed the Myriad Races across the heavens, but never the Human Race. You slaughtered the Daofuse of the Myriad Races, but never the Daofuse of the Human Race..."

Su Yu laughed, "This is really interesting! I thought that once I left, everyone would be cheering, finally sending this plague god away, welcoming the benevolent Hundred Battle! But... you all actually hope I fight back!"

"Of course!"

Marquis Xia loudly declared, "This is our land, our territory, our world, how can we give it to outsiders?"

"Emperor Yu might think he hasn't done much, but... he's wrong! With Emperor Yu's emergence, our Human Race dominated the heavens, we avenged our grievances, and those races that humiliated us back then, they were either destroyed or surrendered! The three great races now have to obediently act like grandsons! We may not be the strongest, but we are willing to enjoy this glory!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, looking at the powerful figures around him. After a moment, he laughed loudly, "You all... are really something! You don't want to enjoy the good days, you insist on fighting back, insist on a bloody battle?"

Before anyone could respond, Su Yu suddenly shouted, "But I like your spirit! Maybe I was wrong. Yes, I thought before, losing the Human Realm... what's the big deal!"

"But you're right, this place, I conquered it!"

"No, maybe you conquered it first, but now, it's mine!"

Su Yu shouted loudly, "This land has a share for me, a share for you! You're right, why should we give it to others? But now, I can't beat Hundred Battle, and I don't want to be his grandson, so I'll let go of this land for now!"

"No problem, when I'm strong enough, we'll come back!"

"If Hundred Battle lets go, great, if not... we'll beat the crap out of him!"

Su Yu shouted loudly, "All Humans, listen to me! If Hundred Battle comes, just accept it for now. If he dares to mistreat you, when I'm strong enough, I'll crush him!"

"For now, endure it, don't resist!"

"If he treats you well, then ignore him. If not... I'll find a chance to kill him!"

Su Yu shouted loudly, shaking the heavens and earth. He even targeted a specific place, shouting, "I will definitely bring everyone back to the Human Realm! Endure him for a while, but not for a lifetime! If you really can't take it anymore, send someone to inform me... I'll come back and stand up for you!"

"At worst, we'll fight to the death!"

At this moment, suddenly, a mountain and sea-like roar resounded through the Human Realm.

"Fight back!"

"Fight back!"

"..."

The roar shook the heavens!

Su Yu suddenly felt the Human Race's fortune rising, speechless. I even feel sorry for Hundred Battle, so pitiful, he hasn't even arrived, and everyone is already rejecting him like this.

I didn't slander you! Recently, to ensure a smooth transition, I even had people speak well of you, saying you love the people like your children... but indeed, the eyes of the masses are bright!

Everyone can see you're not a good person!

Su Yu suddenly laughed, his smile radiant. "Let's go! We'll make a strategic retreat, this place... will soon be ours again!"

At this moment, morale soared, no longer the previous despondency. Let's go! We'll come back in a few days.
