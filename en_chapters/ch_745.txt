Chapter 745: The Gathering at Ren Mountain

Ren Mountain.

Perhaps it should now be called the Myriad Race Mountain.

Su Yu had no particular thoughts about the name; it was all the same to him. This was the eighth day since the second meeting of the myriad races had concluded.

In these eight days, the Iron Devourer Race had arrived at Ren Mountain.

Now, it truly felt like a sea of people.

The Upper Realm wasn't as vast as the Myriad Realms below. It was incomplete, not fully opened, and though it was called the Upper Realm, its rules were not as perfect as those below. The land wasn't as expansive either. Apart from having a denser power of laws and being more primitive, there wasn't much to commend about the Upper Realm.

Moreover, the inhabitants of the Upper Realm originally came from the lower realms. Initially, only a few powerful beings resided here. The birth rate of offspring among these powerful beings was naturally slow. Over ten thousand years, the population of living beings in the Upper Realm hadn't grown significantly.

Yet, even with a smaller population, they were spread out.

Now, gathered together, the number was still astonishingly large.

Some races that had already gone extinct in the lower realms were present here, albeit in small numbers. However, they still existed in the Upper Realm. Su Yu thought that perhaps the Upper Realm could be considered a sanctuary for endangered species.

Races extinct in the lower realms could still be found in the Upper Realm.

For instance, the Dragon Race had over a million members here.

The three major races—God, Demon, and Immortal—had even more, possibly numbering in the tens of millions. Of course, this was still far less than in the lower realms. But with the migration of strong individuals from these three races and the addition of other races, Su Yu estimated that the total number of living beings on Ren Mountain was around fifty to sixty million.

The three major races accounted for half of that!

This was expected. The three major races had abundant resources, strong power, and vast territories. Moreover, they were quite prolific. Over the years, it was only natural for them to occupy half of the Upper Realm's population.

Fifty to sixty million might not be much compared to a small realm in the lower realms, but in the Upper Realm, it was quite a lot.

The Upper Realm had dense source qi and fewer people. Except for newborns, almost everyone started at the Skysoar Realm, making the overall strength a notch higher than in the lower realms.

...

"So many living beings!"

At this moment, among the Iron Devourer Race, some Iron Devourers had their eyes wide open.

They looked like country bumpkins!

Well, apart from the three major races, all the other races had a bit of a country bumpkin demeanor, looking as if they had never seen the world. It was probably their first time seeing so many living beings, so many that they couldn't even count them all.

Su Yu couldn't help but find it amusing.

The Upper Realm... how to put it, they had seen a lot of high-end combat power, but apart from that, they really couldn't compare to the lower realms.

In the lower realms, a single large-scale battle could involve millions or even tens of millions of troops. The Human Race alone had over a million troops in a single major prefecture, and that was considered few. The entire Human Race had a standing army of over thirty million, peaking at nearly fifty million.

And that wasn't even the largest army among the races. The largest was the Fire Pig Race, which could produce millions of troops each year. If they didn't consume them, there wouldn't be enough space in the Fire Pig Realm.

In the Upper Realm, the various races' dojos were spread far apart, and they usually stayed within their dojos. It was rare for the weaker ones to venture out, leading to many Upper Realm beings possibly never leaving their race's dojo until they reached the Sunmoon Realm, much like the daughter of Marquis Dingjun.

In their own race's dojo, some races had only three to five thousand members, and they might only ever see those three to five thousand fellow race members in their lifetime.

This gathering of the myriad races was an eye-opener for these beings.

Not just the Iron Devourer Race, which was considered a major race, but also some smaller races with sparse populations. At this moment, some young beings from these small races were dazzled, feeling as if they had never seen so many living beings and so many races in their lives.

Outside their own race, although they had heard of others, they had never actually seen beings from other races.

"Is that the Iron Devourer Race? Those dark circles under their eyes are huge. Haven't they had enough sleep?"

Su Yu stood on a bamboo mountain, listening to the discussions of the surrounding beings.

He was speechless.

Who said having dark circles meant lack of sleep?

Of course, at this moment, he was also curiously observing some of the smaller races climbing the mountain. Beside him were Marquis Giant Bamboo and April. Su Yu looked in one direction and saw a group of enormous beasts. They weren't many, but their size was comparable to the top-tier dragons in their true forms.

He glanced over and curiously asked, "What race is that?"

I'm curious too!

I've never seen them before!

Marquis Giant Bamboo looked over, scanned them, and chuckled, "Those are the Giant Void Beasts. Don't be fooled by their size; they're not very strong! Their bellies are empty, so they can be used as palaces or camps. In ancient times, they were often seen transporting goods. But with the advent of storage rings, their importance diminished. As space laws were developed, this race gradually declined. They were once numerous in ancient times!"

Su Yu nodded and looked in another direction. "What about over there?"

Over there, a group of enormous birds soared into the sky, but these birds had nine heads!

"Those are the Nine-Headed Birds. This race isn't weak. They were wiped out in the lower realms, but they still exist in the Upper Realm. They're quite ferocious and are considered fierce beasts. During the third tide, they were exterminated in the lower realms by Yue Gang and his men. This race liked to eat corpses and devoured many human corpses, drawing the ire of the Human Race... There's still a quasi-king of this race in the Upper Realm."

At that moment, among the Nine-Headed Birds, a massive one suddenly turned all nine heads towards them, as if aware that Su Yu and the others were watching. Eighteen eyes glinted with ferocity.

Nine mouths opened simultaneously, "Giant Bamboo, it's been a while since I last tasted your race's corpses. When will you send some over?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo chuckled, "Want to eat corpses?"

Before the words finished, a colossal bamboo descended from the sky!

Boom!

A thunderous sound echoed across the heavens.

The nine-headed bird's nine heads, some spewing fire, some water, some unleashing a myriad of swords, were all obliterated by a single bamboo strike!

Boom!

With a loud crash, one of the massive heads was smashed to pieces.

Despite his large size, Marquis Giant Bamboo moved with incredible speed, stepping through the air and closing in on the nine-headed bird, chuckling, "Eat up! Grab your weapons, clansmen, let's annihilate this race! Our Iron Devourer Race is one of the five major races, a decision-maker in the council. To provoke us is to provoke the five major races!"

With a shout, over ten thousand Iron Devourers suddenly pulled out large bamboo sticks, rumbling down the bamboo mountain, charging towards the nine-headed birds!

Marquis Giant Bamboo continued to shout, "Kill! The Nine-Headed Birds have betrayed the myriad races, allied with the Human Race, and now they want to kill one of the council's decision-making races. Our March Heavenly Sovereign is still fighting in the Source of the Dao. Are they rebelling?"

"......"

Behind him, Su Yu was momentarily stunned. Is this really happening?

You big fat cat, with your thick eyebrows and big eyes, you're pulling this kind of stunt too?

Of course, it didn't stop him from joining in the fun.

In the next moment, Su Yu's body glowed with golden light, seventy-two castings, a hallmark of the Iron Devourer Race, and he charged forward!

Crashing through, Su Yu sent dozens of Nine-Headed Birds flying, their bodies exploding, blood spraying everywhere.

"Stop!"

A furious shout came from the front. On Ren Mountain, several figures broke through the air, and Marquis Yuan Sheng, with a gloomy face, shouted, "Enough!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo echoed, "Enough! Did you hear that? How dare you provoke the five major races, not putting them in your eyes? With this attitude, do you expect to attack Chaos Mountain? You don't even listen to the orders of the five major races! Are you rebelling?"

"......"

Marquis Yuan Sheng's expression changed slightly.

Over there, the Nine-Headed Bird, with three heads smashed, quickly retreated, transforming into a human form. A middle-aged man with a sinister gaze appeared, glaring at Marquis Giant Bamboo with a grim expression.

"Marquis Yuan Sheng... Giant Bamboo, he..."

"Enough!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng interrupted him with a cold shout, looking at Marquis Giant Bamboo, and said in a deep voice, "Giant Bamboo, since the Iron Devourer Race is here, quickly find a place to settle. Ren Mountain is divided into eighteen levels. The top three levels, the first is for the council, and you can choose a place on the second or third level."

The entire Ren Mountain was like a tiered cake, divided into layers. This was also part of the Human Race's plan back then.

Different levels of strength resided on different tiers to prevent weaker beings from being overshadowed by stronger ones.

Marquis Giant Bamboo, hearing his attempt to smooth things over, chuckled, "Alright, I'll choose a place later! By the way, how should we punish the Nine-Headed Bird for provoking the five major races and the council? Since the myriad races are united, there should be rules. We can't have no regulations; otherwise, what's the point of having decision-making races?"

"Marquis Yuan Sheng, don't you think I have a point?"

Marquis Giant Bamboo grinned. This big fat cat wasn't a good person to begin with. Otherwise, he wouldn't have suggested Su Yu go kill three Daofuse Realm experts.

Now, he was making a fuss, regardless of whether Marquis Yuan Sheng wanted to smooth things over or not!

Anyway, he was just looking for trouble!

To establish the Iron Devourer Race's status as one of the five races with decision-making power, not as cannon fodder. If they couldn't be the boss, they couldn't be the underling either. Otherwise, with their small numbers, the Iron Devourer Race could easily be wiped out.

Just arriving, Marquis Giant Bamboo hadn't even thought of how to pick a fight, and here the Nine-Headed Bird had to look at him one more time?

Of course, that Nine-Headed Bird wasn't called Marquis Nine Birds.

At this moment, Marquis Yuan Sheng frowned slightly and asked, "Marquis Nine Absolutes, what's going on?"

The Nine-Headed Bird looked grim, "Marquis Yuan Sheng, he deliberately picked a fight..."

Marquis Giant Bamboo chuckled, "Nonsense, everyone heard it. You wanted to kill my clansmen and eat their corpses. Do you deny it?"

The Nine-Headed Bird looked grim, "It was because you deliberately targeted me with your aura that I said such things..."

"Nonsense!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo denied it, "I just arrived and was looking around. How could I target you? There are so many races around, why would I target you? Who do you think you are? Marquis Yuan Sheng, you heard him admit it himself!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo chuckled, "Provoking my race, and my race has a Heavenly Sovereign. If even a race with a Heavenly Sovereign is provoked, it chills the hearts of others. Who would still fight for the council of the myriad races?"

Marquis Yuan Sheng already had an inkling of the situation. He squinted slightly, glanced at Marquis Giant Bamboo, and after a moment, said calmly, "Marquis Nine Absolutes was at fault initially, but Marquis Giant Bamboo has already punished him..."

Before Marquis Giant Bamboo could speak again, he continued slowly, "In that case, Marquis Nine Absolutes will be assigned to the Iron Devourer Vanguard for the upcoming operations. We are currently discussing the candidates for the first wave into Chaos Mountain. Conveniently, the five races will each form a vanguard, entering from five different regions. As one of the five races, the Iron Devourer Race will establish the Iron Devourer Vanguard. Marquis Nine Absolutes is also a quasi-king realm expert! Under normal circumstances, we would all want him. Now that he has erred, I'll leave it to you, Marquis Giant Bamboo, to make the arrangements!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo remained silent.

A vanguard?

Marquis Nine Absolutes being assigned to me?

This didn't seem like good news!

Beside him, Marquis Nine Absolutes' expression shifted, as if he had realized something. He said sinisterly, "I have no objections. Since Marquis Giant Bamboo feels I have offended him, I will atone for my mistakes and not jeopardize the Myriad Race Council's affairs!"

Marquis Giant Bamboo shrugged indifferently, "Forget it, I can't be bothered with such trivial matters. April, you handle it!"

Beside him, April chuckled foolishly, "I can't do it either. I'm too lazy to manage it. May, it's your turn!"

May, who was actually Su Yu at this moment, looked reluctant as he spoke, "Full Moon..."

Lantian mimicked them, chuckling foolishly, "I can't do it either. I just entered the Daofuse Realm. May, it's still up to you!"

Su Yu appeared dazed, chuckling foolishly, "Me? I don't think that's a good idea. Besides, I can't even beat Marquis Yuan Sheng..."

Marquis Yuan Sheng frowned slightly.

This race always pretended to be foolish while hiding their intelligence!

Who would truly believe this race was foolish?

So many ancient races close to the Human Race had been wiped out, yet the Iron Devourer Race remained unscathed, always knowing when to advance and retreat. During the Ninth Tide, when other races were wiped out, the Iron Devourer Race saw the Hundred Battle King growing arrogant and immediately retreated, resulting in no losses for them.

The same happened during the Third Tide.

Leave it to May to handle!

Marquis Yuan Sheng frowned slightly, but quickly said, "May, since your race has chosen you, then... you will attend the upcoming Myriad Race meetings! Currently, the Destiny Race's Tian Ce and the Giant Race's Lei Lie will soon join the council, forming a decision-making body of seven races!"

In addition to the three major races, there were the Nether Race and the Iron Devourer Race.

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "It seems they're all quasi-kings, so I seem to be the weakest."

May was only a third-tier Daofuse Realm cultivator, close to second-tier, while April was second-tier Daofuse.

In terms of strength, he was indeed weaker compared to the others.

However, Marquis Giant Bamboo did not participate, and only Marquis Giant Bamboo from the Iron Devourer Race was a Heavenly King.

Marquis Yuan Sheng said calmly, "It's just to make some decisions on behalf of the Heavenly Sovereigns. As long as the Heavenly Sovereigns have no objections, it won't affect anything, nor do we need to do much!"

After speaking, he added, "May, if you're free, we're having a meeting now. You can come and join us!"

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "Is it appropriate? Should I have my grandfather provide some proof or something? Otherwise, it doesn't feel official..."

Official, my foot!

Marquis Yuan Sheng looked at him, then at Marquis Giant Bamboo. Marquis Giant Bamboo scolded, "May, just go when you're told! Why so much nonsense? I'll talk to March. We all need to go back to sleep and find our territories. Hurry up and attend the meeting, lest we get sold out without knowing!"

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "Alright then."

With that, he followed Marquis Yuan Sheng with an honest expression, his large eyes filled with confusion, as if asking why they hadn't left yet.

Marquis Yuan Sheng squinted his eyes, then quickly smiled, "Let's go together."

After speaking, he glanced around and said lightly, "All races, settle in an orderly manner and follow the arrangements! The Myriad Race Mountain is vast enough for everyone to settle. Do not cause conflicts over insufficient source qi or power of laws, or lack of territory! The priority is to deal with the Chaos Race, not internal strife! The Myriad Races are powerful, yet when competing with the Human Race, they have lost more than they have won. If not for the Chaos lineage's betrayal of the Hundred Battle King thousands of years ago, you wouldn't have today's good days!"

"The Human Race was so powerful, yet they were defeated by a single woman from the Chaos Race. The Myriad Race Alliance should not underestimate the opponent!"

"I hope everyone can unite as one and not be provoked by those with ulterior motives. It's very likely that they are spies from the Chaos Race!"

His words were full of implications.

These people with ulterior motives, provocations, seemed to be pointing at someone.

However, Su Yu pretended not to hear, letting him say whatever he wanted.

Soon, he followed Marquis Yuan Sheng up the mountain.

...

At this moment, on Ren Mountain, a large number of experts were setting up.

Su Yu glanced around. People from the three major races were present, distributed in all directions. Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "Marquis Yuan Sheng, what are they doing?"

"Setting up formations!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng chuckled, "To protect the safety of the Myriad Races, the three major races have spent countless resources to set up the Myriad Race Formation from back in the day! In the past, the Myriad Race Council was also enveloped by this formation, and even the rulers of laws could not intrude! Of course, it's not like back then now. At most, it can intercept some quasi-kings from breaking in... but it's still safer than before!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng chuckled again, "Of course, we didn't inform the Iron Devourer Race about this, to save them some resources. Besides, your race isn't skilled in setting up formations. May, you won't mind, will you?"

Su Yu chuckled foolishly, "Why would I! It's a good thing, making it safer! The three major races have thought it through. So, will entry and exit tokens be arranged next, with no entry or exit without a token?"

"Yes!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng also smiled, "One token per person! Entry and exit will be recorded, to prevent some from colluding with the Chaos Race and leaking information."

"Will communication be affected?"

Su Yu asked again, and Marquis Yuan Sheng smiled, "It will be, but there are public communication tokens available for use at any time. You can set up codes or whatever you like, but personal communication tokens won't work!"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless. This time, the three major races were serious.

Strict defense, strict control of the Myriad Races.

If the Myriad Races truly united, their strength would still be extremely formidable.

As long as the three major races didn't collapse and could maintain their deterrence, this alliance might succeed, and it might reach a peak. After all, it's not like the past; many strong races have been wiped out.

On the side of the three major races, no one could oppose them.

Previously, the Dragon, Phoenix, and Nether races still had the strength to resist, but now, the Dragon and Nether races have suffered heavy losses, their strength greatly diminished, and the Phoenix Race cannot support itself alone. As a result, Su Yu and Chaos Mountain have instead helped the three major races achieve unity.

Su Yu said nothing more and continued flying upwards. On the way, he seemed to see some unfamiliar strong individuals and asked, "Marquis Yuan Sheng, these... seem to be unfamiliar strong individuals."

"From the Land of Dao Source."

Marquis Yuan Sheng smiled, "We'll also talk about the situation on the side of the Land of Dao Source later. May, just wait a moment, and you'll know."

"Alright!" 

...

It was still the same grand hall as last time.

But this time, there were very few people, just seven.

The Immortal Race's Marquis Yuan Sheng, the Demon Race's Marquis Purple Lightning, the God Race's Marquis Flash Spirit, and from the Nether Race, it wasn't a Heavenly King who came, but a second-tier Daofuse cultivator. The two Heavenly Kings from last time had died, so this time, it was Marquis Death Nether who came.

Then there was Su Yu, Tian Ce from the Destiny Race, and Lei Lie from the Giant Race.

Apart from Su Yu and Marquis Death Nether, the remaining five were all Heavenly Kings.

Tian Ce saw Su Yu and smiled slightly, though he was slightly puzzled. This May's fortune seemed to have risen as well. Last time it was April, this time it's May. Is the Iron Devourer Race truly experiencing a surge in fortune, benefiting everyone?

Marquis Yuan Sheng didn't stand on ceremony, inviting everyone to sit down and smiling, "Everyone's here! Our seven races now lead the Myriad Race Alliance. Everyone knows May from the Iron Devourer Race, so I won't introduce him further!"

"Continuing from the previous topic..."

He looked at Su Yu, "Just now, we received information from the Land of Dao Source. This time, the cleanup of the Land of Dao Source is nearing completion!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng said solemnly, "Among them, over ten quasi-kings have been swept out!"

Everyone was shocked!

"So many?"

Lei Lie exclaimed, "Over ten quasi-kings?"

"Indeed!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng nodded, "The Golden Crow Race, the Gluttonous Race... all have them! Not to mention, your Giant Race also has a quasi-king still alive, the Earthquake Guardian of the Mountain Giant Race. Lei Lie, you should be familiar with him, right?"

Lei Lie took a deep breath, quickly showing joy, "Of course, Earthquake is still alive?"

"Yes!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng didn't bother with him, quickly saying in a low voice, "Not just quasi-kings, there are also Heavenly Sovereigns... not just one!"

At these words, everyone showed surprise!

There are Heavenly Sovereign-level existences too?

"Heavenly Sovereigns too?"

Marquis Death Nether asked in surprise, "From which race?"

"Not just one!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng said faintly, "Soon, the decision-making body of the seven races may change! This time, three slumbering Heavenly Sovereigns have appeared. The Dragon and Phoenix races, worthy of being ancient major races, have each produced a Heavenly Sovereign this time..."

He said, smiling faintly, "The key is, these two seniors, one dragon and one phoenix... were in dual cultivation, swept out by the Demon Race's Mo Heavenly Sovereign, almost leading to a great battle..."

Everyone's expressions turned strange, dual cultivation!

Marquis Yuan Sheng laughed, "Although the Dragon Race has suffered heavy losses, this time, a Heavenly Sovereign has emerged, and they have allied with the Phoenix Race. As a result, their strength is likely not weak, which is a good thing!"

He laughed, "The more strong individuals, the better! The Dragon and Phoenix races will soon join us."

"What about the other one?"

Everyone quickly asked.

Marquis Yuan Sheng squinted, "From the Human Race!"

Everyone was shocked, from the Human Race!

"The Human Race's Giant Axe Marquis!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng laughed, "But he was captured! This time, three Heavenly Sovereign-level experts appeared, and as for quasi-kings, there should be a total of 13, with two from the Human Race, and the remaining 11 from various races!"

"In addition, there are also several top-tier Daofuse experts, with the entire Land of Dao Source sweeping out nearly 40 Daofuse experts!"

Everyone was shocked; this was no small number!

And those who have been slumbering for many years are not weak.

Even if they are not Heavenly Kings, they are top-tier Daofuse experts.

The Human Race had one Heavenly Sovereign, two Heavenly Kings, and according to Marquis Yuan Sheng, two top-tier Daofuse Realm experts. In total, five powerful figures were swept out, with none escaping. After all, with so many Heavenly Sovereigns encircling them, escape was nearly impossible.

"Forty Daofuse Realm experts..." Tian Ce couldn't help but sigh. "I didn't expect there to be so many powerful beings in the Land of Dao Source who hadn't appeared before. But... their lifespans must be nearing their end, right?"

Marquis Yuan Sheng nodded slightly. "Indeed, some of them are close to exhausting their lifespans. However, various races are gathering resources, including treasures to extend life, trying to delay their demise and perhaps allow them to advance further..."

He sighed, "We've all come from ancient times to the present. It's not just them; we... probably don't have much time left either!"

He shook his head. Back then, they were considered young. But among those who were conferred the title of Marquis in ancient times, how many were truly young? If this continues, they will all perish. A new generation will replace the old!

Becoming a Master of Rules seemed hopeless. In ancient times, a Heavenly King could instantly become a Master of Rules. There was no such thing as a Heavenly Sovereign back then because a Heavenly Sovereign was essentially a Master of Rules!

Soon, Marquis Zidian of the Demon Race chuckled, "Even if they don't have much time left, at least they won't die immediately! The complete annihilation of the Human Race might be our chance to step into the realm of the Master of Rules!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng smiled, "What if the path you and I cultivate still has a living Master of Rules?"

"......"

Suddenly, the group fell silent. That... could be possible. If one truly existed, unless the original Master of Rules was eliminated, it would still be a dead end.

Tian Ce smiled wryly, "Why extinguish everyone's hope, Dao Brother?"

"Indeed!" Marquis Yuan Sheng laughed, "I'm just saying, don't be too optimistic, especially with the existence of the Chaos Race and the Torchbearer lineage... Now, there's news from the Land of Dao Source clearly stating that the Torchbearer lineage truly exists!"

His tone grew somber, "And they're not weak! The Dragon Race and the events at Sealing Mountain were their doing, while the affairs of the Nether Race were the work of the Chaos Race."

"Of course, the Torchbearer lineage might currently reside in the lower realm, so for now, we can't do much... Let's deal with the Chaos lineage's trouble first!"

He looked at Su Yu, "Friend May, everyone else knows, but I'll repeat it. Among the seven races present, each must form a team to venture into Chaos Mountain. There are hundreds of peaks on the outskirts of Chaos Mountain, with possibly dozens of Daofuse Realm ancient beasts..."

Not just that! Su Yu knew better. Last time, he circled Dao Origin Mountain, surveying a thousand-mile radius. Using the Chaos Forest as a boundary, he found 77 peaks, 22 Daofuse Realm beasts, and three rivers and a forest yet to be explored, but likely containing at least 26 Daofuse Realm beasts.

And that was just within a thousand miles, spanning only two thousand miles across Dao Origin Mountain. The entire Chaos Mountain covered a vast area, over ten thousand miles, so multiplying by five was more accurate!

If truly multiplied by five... that would be terrifying! However, Su Yu judged that Dao Origin Mountain was central, with denser chaotic energy, so there might be more ancient beasts there. The sides would likely have fewer.

Even so, multiplying by three wouldn't be a problem. There could be seventy to eighty ancient beasts! And this was just the outskirts. Extremely dangerous!

From the Nether Race, Marquis of Death couldn't help but say, "It's too dangerous. There's a problem we need to solve. If we venture in, we'll surely be attacked by ancient beasts. If this issue isn't resolved, going in recklessly is courting death!"

Tian Ce added, "In the past, the Human Race's Marquis Anbei lived there for some years, but was later discovered, leading to the death of seven Daofuse Realm experts from the myriad races... As long as a battle occurs there, ancient beasts will surely come. Unless this issue is resolved, we must clear all ancient beasts first!"

But doing so would consume a lot of power. Concentrating Heavenly Sovereigns to clear them isn't impossible. However, if Heavenly Sovereigns get entangled in a fight, consuming a lot of energy, and suddenly some strong individuals launch a surprise attack, it would be troublesome. Heavenly Sovereigns aren't invincible!

Thus, when a great battle erupts, weaker ones are sent first to probe and deal with weaker beings. The top-tier experts are the key to the later stages of the battle.

Marquis Yuan Sheng smiled, "There's news from the Land of Dao Source about this. They're working on a solution and have made progress. We might not be suppressed by Chaos Mountain's influence! We won't be attacked by ancient beasts as soon as we enter..."

"Really?"

Everyone was overjoyed. If true, it would solve a huge problem and save many lives.

Su Yu secretly grumbled. Damn it, I haven't even given you anything, and you're already spreading the news. Are you planning to cooperate with me? Using five Human Race experts to trade for these?

The key is... I don't even have them. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King had their arms and legs dismantled, leaving only eight formation symbols, one of which stayed at the base, leaving only seven.

But last time, when the Nether Heavenly Sovereign and others killed a few ancient beasts, perhaps I could ask for some to be made.

Su Yu also needed those formation symbols!

Marquis Yuan Sheng smiled, "It's true, but... it needs to remain confidential for now, and it's just a piece of news. We don't know the specifics yet!"

He looked at Su Yu again, "Friend May, even with the Dragon and Phoenix Races, the nine-race alliance, and nine vanguard armies, each race must sweep a thousand-mile radius of Chaos Mountain..."

Su Yu asked naively, "Sweep separately? Not concentrate together?"

Separating would be more dangerous!

Marquis Yuan Sheng nodded, "Separate. Otherwise, spanning ten thousand miles of Chaos Mountain with numerous peaks, sweeping would be very difficult! Our target isn't the ancient beasts but the Chaos lineage! There's no need to fight everywhere. Once we detect the Chaos lineage's traces, we'll focus our attack on one area rather than waging a full-scale war..."

He smiled again, "The thousand-mile interval allows for quick support! Of course, that requires everyone to progress at a similar pace. If the distances become too great, there's nothing we can do... So everyone must be cautious and try to stay aligned!"

"And for the deeper, inner areas, don't venture recklessly."

Su Yu asked again, "But I'm worried about being picked off by the Chaos lineage one by one. This disperses our forces. If they launch a surprise attack... isn't it too dangerous?"

He wasn't too clear about these people's plans. Why disperse the forces? Concentrate and sweep!

Marquis Yuan Sheng chuckled, "It is somewhat dangerous, but... with so many people, how would the Chaos lineage dare to come out?"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless. Damn it, you're using people as targets!

Marquis Yuan Sheng smiled, "So everyone must be cautious. In critical moments, if there's danger, we'll rush to the rescue. We're concerned that if all the strong ones are together, the other side will keep setting traps... Including the recent phenomenon of ancient beasts gathering in Chaos Mountain, which isn't good!"

"We'll disperse and sweep each peak. Ancient beasts have territorial instincts. This way, we can force some gathered ancient beasts to return, preventing them from concentrating and causing large-scale Daofuse Realm battles, resulting in massive losses!"

He said solemnly, "A single or a couple of Daofuse Realm ancient beasts aren't much! But twenty or thirty, even a Heavenly Sovereign could be besieged! That's the real danger! Even if we reach the quasi-king realm, five or six Daofuse Realm experts could besiege us... So, preventing ancient beasts from gathering is a must!"

Su Yu asked again, "So each of the nine families recruits their own people?"

"Correct!"

Su Yu was speechless, "Our Iron Devourer Race doesn't have many friends..."

"Forced conscription!"

Marquis Yuan Sheng said indifferently, "The Immortal, Demon, and God Races won't recruit outsiders. Other races' experts will be incorporated into each vanguard army. Of course, how many you can recruit depends on your ability! If there aren't enough people, we won't let anyone send them to their deaths. Some unwilling troublemakers will be incorporated, forcibly, and won't be given the chance to shirk their duties! They'll supplement those vanguard armies lacking manpower!"

"We don't intend to send anyone to their deaths. Each team will have at least two quasi-kings, with no fewer than ten Daofuse Realm experts. This way, even if ambushed by a Heavenly Sovereign-level expert, they can still fight!"

Su Yu thought for a moment. This arrangement seemed quite reasonable. With nine such teams, even if ambushed by a Heavenly Sovereign, they could resist and wait for reinforcements.

The distance between two teams was only about a thousand miles. A true expert might be able to reach them instantly, provided there were no obstacles in between, given the numerous peaks here.

Chaos Mountain had too many peaks!

Su Yu grinned naively, "Aren't the teams on the sides more dangerous? Because even if reinforcements come, it's only from one side. Why not have the Dragon and Phoenix Races each take a side?"

"......"

Everyone looked at him, each with a meaningful expression. May, you seem naive, but your ideas are quite cunning.

Indeed, the sides were more dangerous. The middle had people from both sides ready to assist, but the sides only had one. The third team would be at least three thousand miles away, taking time to arrive!

Marquis Yuan Sheng chuckled, "The sides are actually safer, with fewer ancient beasts. I was thinking of having the Iron Devourer Race take one side. May, think it over. The central area has more ancient beasts!"

That made sense. Without an ambush, the sides were indeed safer.

Su Yu grinned, "Let's discuss it further. The main goal now is to form the vanguard armies, right? Can we freely recruit experts from various races?"

"Start with voluntary recruitment, then see!"

Alright. Su Yu considered whether to gather some experts himself, to avoid becoming a target for the Control King's lineage. The Control King's lineage would almost certainly launch a surprise attack! It would be strange if they didn't, and the three major races might want just that!

Finally, Marquis Yuan Sheng added, "Additionally... if any vanguard army suffers too many losses..."

He looked at Su Yu and the others, speaking in a somber tone, "The races you form must bear certain responsibilities! It's not acceptable for you to lead many out, only for them all to perish while you alone survive. If the gains and sacrifices are not proportional, then a price must be paid!"

"I'm not targeting any of you specifically. I just hope that everyone can unite as one, rather than harboring personal agendas. If you end up ambushing and killing some of the strong ones you usually don't get along with at Chaos Mountain, that's not an outcome the council wishes to see!"

Clearly, these individuals had already guessed some people's intentions. 

Conflicts among the myriad races were not new. Everyone knew each other well by now. 

Su Yu and the others remained silent, deciding to wait and see. Currently, the Chaos lineage was the main focus. Even Su Yu shared this mindset; it wasn't necessary to kill a few strong ones from the myriad races.

After finishing his speech, Marquis Yuan Sheng quickly smiled and said, "That's all for now. Once everyone is prepared, the Heavenly Sovereigns will likely return. By then, there might be even more powerful individuals. In the various dangerous lands, there might still be strong ones present. Perhaps we can even sweep out some Heavenly Sovereigns and quasi-kings!"

...

Everyone dispersed.

Tiance walked beside Su Yu, smiling as he transmitted a message, "Friend May, our two races can be neighbors and look out for each other!"

Su Yu grinned foolishly, "Sure, I'll report this to Marquis Giant Bamboo!"

Tiance chuckled and said no more. After walking a bit further, he suddenly transmitted again, "Little friend Changhe mentioned he has a friend named September. Does friend May know him?"

"September?" 

Su Yu looked puzzled, "I only know August from my race... Who is September?"

Tiance watched him for a moment, then smiled, nodded, and left gracefully.

Su Yu cursed inwardly, realizing that Changhe had indeed been taken by them! These old foxes were still testing him. What was there to test?
