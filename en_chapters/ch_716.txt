Chapter 716: A Different Outcome

At this moment, countless thoughts raced through the mind of General Yingwu. She was also on high alert. Staring at Su Yu, she asked in a deep voice, "Who are you?"

"Su Yu," he replied with a smile. "Or you could call me the Human Lord."

"Human Lord..." General Yingwu naturally sensed his aura but still spoke in a low voice, "Are you from the lower realm?"

"Yes," Su Yu said, quietly observing her. General Yingwu felt a bit uneasy and took a step back. "Why are you looking for me? And how have you been tracking me?"

Su Yu gazed at her for a long time before speaking softly, "Do I really need to explain why I'm looking for you?"

Calmly, Su Yu continued, "Or do you just want to be a lone wolf? If that's the case, I won't bother you."

General Yingwu frowned. "You want me to join you? Or help you?"

"No need to help me," Su Yu replied calmly. "Just don't cause trouble. You people could potentially create problems for me!"

General Yingwu frowned at him, then glanced at the Great Zhou King. After a moment, she asked, "Then why are you here?"

Su Yu sighed inwardly. "No particular reason. You seem smart. Smarter than Marquis Dingjun. I'll give you two choices: join me and serve for a few years, or stay in your old lair for three years without stepping out of the First Line Gorge. But I'll set up some formations there. If you leave, I'll consider it a betrayal of the Human Race."

"Why should I?" General Yingwu's face was cold.

"Because I am the Human Lord of this era, the leader of the Human Race!" Su Yu said calmly. "Because I have the power to kill you at any time, yet I haven't. Don't force me to make you take the third option, or you'll regret it."

General Yingwu looked at him, cursing inwardly. What an arrogant guy! He came here, said nothing, and the so-called third option was nothing more than killing her.

...

Beside them, the Great Zhou King remained silent, sighing inwardly. Su Yu had a deep-seated prejudice against these ancient humans. He had said multiple times that he would rather seek help from other races than rely on the Human Race, as it wasn't solely his but belonged to everyone. He didn't force these strong individuals to contribute; as long as they didn't interfere, it was fine. However, this time, they were interfering with his plans, prompting Su Yu to take action against these ancient powerhouses.

The Great Zhou King finally spoke, "General Yingwu, Marquis Dingjun has already joined Emperor Yu! Emperor Yu's ascent to the upper realm is for an important mission. Are you aware of the Dragon Clan incident? That was our doing."

He looked at her earnestly. "We mean no harm. We just don't want too much trouble and conflict while consolidating the Human Race's forces."

General Yingwu frowned. "The Dragon Clan incident was your doing?"

"Indeed."

General Yingwu was slightly shaken. She had heard about it. Although the news wasn't very clear, such a significant event was being discussed in the upper realm, and she had caught some wind of it. It turned out to be the work of these people from the lower realm!

She looked at the white-haired Human Lord before her for a long time, then asked in a deep voice, "What if the Hundred Battle King isn't dead and returns?"

Su Yu frowned slightly. The Great Zhou King also spoke softly, "That has nothing to do with us."

The Great Zhou King was helpless. Once again, it was about the Hundred Battle King... At this moment, the Hundred Battle King had become an obstacle.

Unexpectedly, General Yingwu suddenly burst out angrily, "Nothing to do with us? How can it have nothing to do with us! If he returns, that idiot, that fool, if he seizes power again and sends us to our deaths, are we supposed to listen to him?"

She seemed very angry. "That fool, stubborn and arrogant, thinks he's invincible. In reality, he's just a moron! I said Zhou Tiansheng had issues, he didn't believe me! I said that woman had issues, he didn't believe me! I said we shouldn't sacrifice our allies lightly, he still didn't listen! I said we should first clear out some minor races, he didn't listen! I said we should take down the strong ones outside the Three Clans first, he still didn't listen!"

"Such a stubborn guy, apart from being strong, is useless! If he gets unsealed again and you can't defeat him, and he seizes power, do you expect me to continue working for this fool?"

"......"

Su Yu was stunned. The Great Zhou King was also stunned. What... does this mean?

Su Yu was a bit dazed, looking at her in surprise. "You... you don't like the Hundred Battle King?"

General Yingwu angrily replied, "He's just an idiot! Stubborn, arrogant, thinks he's the best, invincible in battle, but in reality, he's just a fool! I said Zhou Tiansheng had issues, he didn't believe me! I said that woman had issues, he didn't believe me! I said we shouldn't sacrifice our allies lightly, he still didn't listen! I said we should first clear out some minor races, he didn't listen! I said we should take down the strong ones outside the Three Clans first, he still didn't listen!"

"Such a stubborn guy, apart from being strong, is useless! If he gets unsealed again and you can't defeat him, and he seizes power, do you expect me to continue working for this fool?"

"......"

Su Yu's mouth hung open, genuinely shocked. This was the first ancient human powerhouse he had encountered who openly criticized the Hundred Battle King.

General Yingwu, after venting her anger, looked at them warily. "You came to find me, or rather, came to the upper realm, not to unseal the Hundred Battle King, right? If so, count me out! You can go yourselves! I don't want to lead my subordinates to their deaths! Unless you kill me... otherwise, let him unseal himself. If he can, he can. If not, I won't care!"

She took a few steps back, filled with anger and despair. She didn't want to do this at all.

Marquis Minshan, Marquis Zhennan, they all approached her, asking her to help rescue the Hundred Battle King... She refused them all, even if not openly, she stalled and ignored them.

Rescue the Hundred Battle King? Forget it! Not only would she lose herself, but if the Hundred Battle King got unsealed and gathered the remnants of the Human Race again, they'd be wiped out in no time!

It's better to remain scattered; maybe some could survive.

Su Yu looked at her for a long while, then chuckled. "You're the first I've met who doesn't support rescuing the Hundred Battle King!"

General Yingwu coldly replied, "He won't die. If the myriad races could kill him, they would have done so long ago! They haven't, which means they're waiting for him to unseal himself so they can kill him, or they have other plans! Since he won't die, he can unseal himself eventually. Why should we risk our lives to save him? Is it worth it? Even if we save him, what then? He couldn't win back then, let alone now!"

In any case, she didn't see the Hundred Battle King as a savior.

"I'm hiding in the First Line Gorge now, and it's fine. I don't need the Hundred Battle King to save me!"

General Yingwu looked at the two of them, then at Su Yu, coldly saying, "Even if you save him, he won't listen to you. Don't overthink it! The Hundred Battle King is stubborn, arrogant, and respects only martial strength! He values bloodlines and status the most. Since I'm a titled general and not an ancient marquis, I have no status under him! The same goes for you. Your so-called Human Lord is just child's play in his eyes. Do you think he'll give you anything if he comes out?"

"Unless you have the Human Emperor's bloodline, the Four Kings' bloodline, or are a direct descendant of the Human King, otherwise... if you're not at the quasi-king realm, you're nothing in his eyes, not even as noble as any ancient marquis!"

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King. Is that true? Why hadn't he heard this before?

The Great Zhou King, seeing Su Yu's gaze, coughed lightly and said, "The Hundred Battle King does indeed value bloodlines, status, and martial strength."

Su Yu chuckled. "What bloodline does he have?"

"It's said he might have the Battle King's bloodline."

Su Yu laughed. "Isn't he related to the Ancient Giant Race?"

The Great Zhou King was silent for a moment before saying, "The Ancient Giant Race is considered a dominant race of the ancient times, even rumored to be a branch of the Human Race. In the eyes of the Hundred Battle King, their bloodline is not low."

Su Yu nodded, understanding. Just an old-fashioned guy. Only now did he realize how little he knew about the Hundred Battle King. A stubborn conservative! No wonder so many ancient relics liked this guy; he fit their interests and ideals.

Opposite, General Yingwu continued to frown at the two of them. When they mentioned the Hundred Battle King, the Great Zhou King seemed fine, but Su Yu's tone carried a hint of disdain.

General Yingwu looked at Su Yu, silent for a while, then asked, "Your strength doesn't seem too strong, but you can deal with the Dragon Clan. Do you have a quasi-king backing you?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled. "Yes."

"Does the current Human Race operate in a council format?"

General Yingwu looked at him, her voice low. "In this council, how much say do you have?"

Su Yu was speechless. How much say do I have? Where's this council?

Seeing his reaction, General Yingwu's expression changed slightly. "As expected! You don't even have control over your voice, yet you want to subdue me. It will inevitably lead to another chaotic struggle. I hate such struggles! Those people always speak of unrealistic fantasies! The ancient times have perished, and the glory of the past cannot be restored... You will eventually destroy the Human Race!"

A puppet! At this moment, she understood that this Human Lord was even worse than the Hundred Battle King. At least the Hundred Battle King had the strength to suppress some things. This one was a complete puppet, controlled by others, unable to make decisions on his own!

Su Yu, at this moment, felt a bit strange. After a while, he said, "The quasi-kings under me also listen to me."

General Yingwu sneered. "You can suppress those people? You look young, with decent talent and strength, but you probably only control a few people. Can you even control this Zhou Tiansheng? Maybe... he's here to monitor you!"

General Yingwu sneered. "This guy is also an old relic. He seems obedient, but he's just lulling you into a false sense of security. Such a sinister person didn't reveal his strength even when the great war failed. Now he's following you, isn't it to monitor you?"

A pitiful child! She coldly laughed. "Dingjun has joined you? Indeed, they are about to completely sideline you, waiting for the Hundred Battle King's return. Once he returns, you are nothing. Even if you're not killed, you'll just be a pathetic discarded pawn! If I'm not mistaken, you might be heading to the Dao Source Land soon!"

Su Yu's eyes were peculiar as he nodded. "Yes."

"As expected!"

General Yingwu laughed, "You're too naive, pitiful, and pathetic! Perhaps you went to the Source of the Dao to rescue Hundred Battle, and you don't even know what fate awaits you if you do. And yet, you still want to subdue me?"

"......"

There was no response to that!

Su Yu looked at the Great Zhou King and chuckled, "What she said... makes some sense, don't you think?"

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, "This... I've never encountered such a situation before."

General Yingwu had concocted an entire drama in her mind!

It was reasonable!

It wasn't entirely fabricated but rather a judgment based on Su Yu's age and strength.

It was quite in line with reality!

The Great Zhou King, following along, seemed to be monitoring, which perfectly fit the image of a puppet.

Seeing them converse, General Yingwu added, "Su Yu, you seem young and talented, but don't foolishly fantasize about everything. Don't dream that when Hundred Battle returns, you can subdue him or make him your henchman... that's impossible! Young people always think they're invincible, but it's all just a joke!"

"If I were you, I would delay until the last moment and never actively rescue Hundred Battle!"

Su Yu nodded, "Makes sense!"

Seeing him nod, General Yingwu breathed a slight sigh of relief, then looked warily at the Great Zhou King, "This person is not a good man!"

Su Yu nodded, "Indeed, he's not exactly a good person!"

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, "I... I'm loyal, how am I not a good person?"

What was supposed to be a journey of subjugation had turned into a critique session against himself and Hundred Battle.

Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled, "Maybe you're right. So, right now, I need support. Otherwise, I can't defy those people, can I? General Yingwu, why not come out and assist me once, to prevent the Human Race from falling into Hundred Battle's hands again."

Different strategies were needed for different people.

General Yingwu looked at him, then at the Great Zhou King, and said solemnly, "With this person by your side, harboring ill intentions, you can't possibly develop your own forces!"

Su Yu smiled, "That's why I need General Yingwu to assist me! Of course, the Great Zhou King may have ulterior motives, but he's been bought off by me for now, so he turns a blind eye to some things."

Su Yu chuckled, "Besides, isn't Hundred Battle still sealed?"

General Yingwu frowned, "Then how many strong individuals do you have under your command now? How many quasi-kings?"

"Quasi-kings..."

Su Yu calculated. Fat Ball, South King, and Lantian were all quasi-kings. Wan Tiansheng, Old Turtle, and the Great Zhou King were close, with Old Turtle almost there.

Su Yu smiled, "For now, three."

"Do you have any supporters?"

General Yingwu asked solemnly, "Three is quite a few, more than I expected! Are any of them your supporters? Who are they? Do I know them?"

Three quasi-kings couldn't have appeared out of nowhere.

She might even know them!

To see if there were any staunch supporters of Hundred Battle!

"Of course, I have supporters."

Su Yu smiled, "Otherwise, how could I be the Human Lord, right? There are two you might not know, but there's one you should recognize, the South Heavenly King from the Death Realm. Do you know her?"

"South Heavenly King?"

General Yingwu was slightly taken aback. Another Death Heavenly King?

She said curiously, "Your supporter isn't just this South Heavenly King, is it? If it's her, it makes sense. After all, she lives in the Death Realm and has little to do with the Realm of Living Beings. But her support is limited; she can't leave the Death Realm..."

Su Yu smiled, "At least she's a quasi-king, isn't she?"

That's true.

Su Yu continued, "Besides you, is there anyone else who doesn't support Hundred Battle continuing to unify the Human Race? Only with your help can I have hope... After all, I don't want to be a puppet. General Yingwu, right now, I'm the leader of hundreds of billions of humans, holding the moral high ground, and I have a chance. If I don't fight for it, there won't be any chance left. Once Hundred Battle emerges... and unifies the Human Race again, it'll be troublesome."

General Yingwu frowned, then said solemnly, "These things still depend on your own strength. If you're not strong enough, no matter how much you fight or struggle, it's useless!"

Su Yu smiled, "I'm also close to stepping into the quasi-king realm. Maybe in a few months, when Hundred Battle is unsealed, I think I can still compete!"

General Yingwu was conflicted and torn.

Su Yu added, "Otherwise, I can only hand over the hundreds of billions of humans to Hundred Battle..."

"Impossible!"

General Yingwu said solemnly, "Hundred Battle can be a general, but never a commander! Handing over hundreds of billions of humans to him might lead to another disastrous defeat!"

She struggled for a while, then gritted her teeth, "I can help you, but... I can't take my people away. Let them continue to survive in Yixian Gorge! Also, Marquis Zhennan, Marquis Dingjun, Marquis of Shadows, and Marquis Huoyun, these foolish men, are all staunch supporters of Hundred Battle. They only know how to speak with their fists! Only Marquis Yunshui, I can try to persuade. Marquis Yunshui also looks down on Hundred Battle, who only knows how to use his fists... She's a follower of the Culture King!"

"......"

Su Yu's expression was strange as he looked at the Great Zhou King.

You foolish men only support Hundred Battle.

Look, General Yingwu says that women don't support Hundred Battle.

Speaking of which, I might need to recruit a batch of female generals soon.

South King, Marquis Lanshan, they're also followers of the Culture King.

There are quite a few fangirls of the Culture King.

Those who admire the Culture King seem to look down on someone like Hundred Battle. Actually, Hundred Battle isn't that bad. At this moment, Su Yu even felt sorry for Hundred Battle. Why do these women dislike you so much?

Is a brute not worthy of loyalty?

Originally, General Yingwu was unwilling to come out of seclusion. But upon hearing it was to stop Hundred Battle, she was moved, motivated, and even willing to help persuade Marquis Yunshui to come out and assist...

Is this a buy-one-get-one-free deal?

The reason is that Hundred Battle is about to be unsealed, and they don't want to see the Human Race fall under his control again.

The Great Zhou King was also exhausted.

After a long while, he transmitted to Su Yu, "Emperor Yu... women are incomprehensible. In this regard, Emperor Yu's understanding is not wrong."

Su Yu laughed and transmitted back, "No, I think women are great now. At critical moments, they're more reliable than you guys."

Go to hell!

The Great Zhou King inwardly complained. It's just that these people are willing to listen to you. If these women were stubborn and insisted on supporting Hundred Battle, you'd probably curse them too!

Meanwhile, General Yingwu, seeing the two of them communicating, warily said, "You two..."

Su Yu smiled, "He's advising me not to create divisions, that Hundred Battle isn't the enemy, and that I shouldn't trust you too much, General Yingwu..."

General Yingwu coldly said, "As expected, he's starting to interfere with you! And precisely because of this... Hundred Battle must not regain power! Su Yu, I can come out of seclusion to help you, but I have a condition!"

"Please, go ahead!"

"Once Hundred Battle returns, if you can't compete with him and can't control the Human Race... then I'll leave!"

She coldly said, "I don't want to die in vain! Hundred Battle only knows one move, to punch the enemy to death... If he can't, he'll die. But now, how many can he kill? If he controls the Human Race, he'll eventually lose!"

Su Yu nodded and smiled, "Alright, once Hundred Battle is out, if I can't compete with him and he seizes power, you're free to leave."

General Yingwu sighed in relief, "You're quite sensible!"

She said, then quickly added, "At least you still have the title of Human Lord now, so there's still a chance. Before Hundred Battle is unsealed, build your forces and suppress opposing voices. Only then do you have a chance to win!"

Su Yu nodded and smiled, "Indeed, I agree with that!"

General Yingwu smiled at this moment. She felt that this new Human Lord was much better than Hundred Battle, at least willing to listen to opinions.

Hundred Battle was just a stubborn brute, a warrior, a martial artist!

He wouldn't listen to anything, of course, that's because he wouldn't listen to her. But when those old men spoke, Hundred Battle took it seriously. Hundred Battle was just an idiot!

She cursed him again in her heart.

Human Lord...

She looked at Su Yu again, hoping this generation's Human Lord wasn't just an empty shell.

Coming out of seclusion was inevitable.

It wasn't possible to stay in Yixian Gorge forever. Actually, since the other party was the Human Lord, she should have come out of seclusion. However, she still hoped to secure some favorable conditions for herself. Now, it seemed the results were satisfactory!

If this generation's Human Lord couldn't listen to opinions, she wouldn't want to come out.

Since he could listen... then it was negotiable.

"Then I'll settle my subordinates, and you two wait for me outside. I'll come to find you in an hour!"

General Yingwu quickly said, "Once outside, I can take you to find Marquis Yunshui... As for the other few, I suggest not looking for them. They're all trouble. If you find them, these guys will definitely drag you to rescue Hundred Battle, which is a death sentence!"

Su Yu smiled, "Let's play it by ear. Having more people means more strength. Maybe we can use them for now. With you, General Yingwu, you can restrain them a bit, so they won't cause trouble, right?"

"Maybe!"

General Yingwu was noncommittal. Who knew?

Using them temporarily might be possible.

Su Yu smiled, "Then I'll head out first."

He didn't linger. Not taking subordinates might be a good thing. Yixian Gorge was relatively safe, and ordinary people wouldn't dare to intrude.

...

Soon, Su Yu and the Great Zhou King left Yixian Gorge.

Once outside, the Great Zhou King couldn't help but laugh, "What is this?"

Su Yu smiled, "What, can't Hundred Battle have opponents? I think it's normal. I was wondering before, after Hundred Battle lost such a big battle, how come none of you thought he was inappropriate? Now it seems there are some, but the other opponents might all be dead."

The Great Zhou King nodded, somewhat emotional, "Once General Yingwu knows we're all supporting Emperor Yu, she probably won't have any more concerns! Words alone won't convince her. Over time, she'll naturally understand."

Talking wouldn't work.

The more you explain, the more people think Su Yu is too stupid to see that everyone is trying to sideline him, waiting for Hundred Battle to return.

Su Yu couldn't help but chuckle, nodding in agreement. "In time, she'll naturally understand. It's a good thing!"

His mood was quite good. He had initially thought that every person he encountered would be a staunch supporter of the Hundred Battle King, but finally, there was someone different. Of course, that was a relief.

...

After more than an hour, General Yingwu emerged. She cast a glance at the Great Zhou King, not bothering to acknowledge him, and quickly turned to Su Yu. "I'll take you to find Marquis Yunshui, but... it's best if you don't go in. Let me talk to her first! Especially that Zhou Tiansheng, it's best if he doesn't show his face!"

"I've known Marquis Yunshui for many years. Convincing her to come out of seclusion shouldn't be a problem... but..."

She looked at Su Yu, warning him, "You mustn't appear too weak or timid. Marquis Yunshui won't respect that! Only if you show strength and determination can we help you. Otherwise, expecting me and Marquis Yunshui to resist the Hundred Battle King is unrealistic!"

Su Yu smiled, flicking his robe as his demeanor suddenly transformed from gentle to domineering. In that instant, even General Yingwu was momentarily taken aback by how quickly his aura changed.

A person's aura usually requires years of experience to evolve. Yet, Su Yu, who seemed so gentle just moments ago, had become overwhelmingly domineering in the blink of an eye. This...

After a brief moment of surprise, General Yingwu quickly nodded. "Yes, just like that! As the Human Lord, a king of the Human Race, how can you lack any sense of authority? If you were too weak, that would be a problem!"

She felt reassured. Perhaps this new Human Lord wasn't as frail as she had imagined, which was a good thing. She had been worried he might be too weak, which would complicate matters.

Su Yu smiled, saying nothing more. Securing the support of General Yingwu and Marquis Yunshui was a good thing. With that, only Marquis Zhennan, Marquis Huoyun, and Marquis Shadow remained.

As for Marquis Shadow, Su Yu believed that if the other party was wise, they would know what choice to make. Unlike the more isolated General Yingwu, Marquis Shadow was more informed.

That left Marquis Zhennan and Marquis Huoyun. Marquis Huoyun owed him a life! Yes, Su Yu remembered that it was because of him that the Divine Fire Mountain was saved.

As for Marquis Zhennan, he would see how things unfolded.

...

Marquis Yunshui resided in the Fuchen River, a perilous location. The Fuchen River was vast and interconnected, making it one of the hardest places to besiege. Moreover, Marquis Yunshui didn't dwell on the river's surface but somewhere at the bottom.

As a result, during every siege by the myriad races, they might not even catch a glimpse of her before she vanished.

At this moment, the water's surface was calm and serene.

General Yingwu cautioned, "Don't be fooled by the tranquility here. The Fuchen River is no safer than the Yixian Gorge, perhaps even more dangerous! The greatest danger of the Fuchen River lies in its waters, which cannot be penetrated by willpower! Unless you're familiar with the Water Path, fighting Marquis Yunshui here could suppress even a quasi-king!"

"Marquis Yunshui excels in the Water Path, while Marquis Huoyun excels in the Fire Path. In the past, there were several other marquises who excelled in other Five Elemental Paths, but they have since fallen."

General Yingwu sighed, then quickly added, "Wait here for me, and don't wander off. I'll go find Marquis Yunshui!"

"Can you find her?"

Su Yu asked, and General Yingwu nodded confidently. Of course! Even if few survived from the Upper Realm, they still had their own circles.

As the only two female Daofuse cultivators, they had maintained contact in private.

Su Yu smiled and nodded. "Alright, I'll wait here for you."

Without further ado, General Yingwu dove into the water.

The Great Zhou King, ever vigilant, transmitted his voice, "Be cautious. In this place, the opponent's combat strength will be enhanced. If Marquis Yunshui harbors ill intentions and teams up with General Yingwu..."

Su Yu chuckled, "Am I not adept in the Water Path?"

The Great Zhou King was taken aback. Indeed.

Su Yu continued, "Besides, how many in this world can truly deceive me?"

In his eyes, a small Heaven Gate appeared, constantly observing the water's surface. The rippling water revealed nothing, but with the Heaven Gate open, Su Yu saw clearly.

Beneath the water, there were numerous water beasts, possibly a type of ancient beast. At this moment, he followed the power of General Yingwu's path, watching as she navigated through the water, seemingly avoiding danger.

As he observed, Su Yu pointed in a direction, "Over there!"

"Hmm?"

The Great Zhou King was puzzled. "That's land!"

That area was beyond the Fuchen River.

Su Yu nodded. "Reality is illusion, and illusion is reality! Everyone assumes Marquis Yunshui hides in the water. Why can't she hide on land?"

The Great Zhou King laughed, "These women, they lie without batting an eye. Marquis Shadow and Marquis Dingjun both believed Marquis Yunshui was in the Fuchen River, but it seems the river is just a decoy!"

Su Yu nodded. "It's a decoy. However, if a crisis arises, entering the Fuchen River would be easy for her. Fighting in the water would enhance her combat strength, so she usually hides on land."

Su Yu pointed to a depression by the riverbank, not entirely land, but likely where Marquis Yunshui was hiding.

General Yingwu might know, or she might not. Su Yu observed as General Yingwu lingered underwater for a while, seemingly guided by someone to meet Marquis Yunshui. Upon closer inspection, he chuckled, "There should be an underwater passage leading directly to Marquis Yunshui's location!"

The Great Zhou King sighed, "Indeed, those who survive have their skills! Marquis Dingjun, surviving is no easy feat!"

Su Yu laughed, "Marquis Dingjun's survival was partly due to luck. Previously, Marquis Minshan and others were still alive, and killing Marquis Dingjun would have alerted them. You see, once Marquis Minshan died, Marquis Dingjun became a target, ready to be besieged. If we hadn't come, he would likely be the next to fall!"

"That's true!"

The two chatted leisurely.

After a few exchanges, Su Yu asked, "Can you reach the Heavenly King Realm?"

The Great Zhou King had always been at the peak.

Su Yu pondered whether he could reach the Heavenly King Realm.

The Great Zhou King became more serious, exhaling, "It's difficult! The Heavenly King Realm... let's put it this way, because each Great Dao varies in strength, everyone is essentially in a state of Daofuse. A Heavenly King is simply someone whose fused Great Dao is stronger, hence the concept of a quasi-king..."

"The Path of Endurance isn't particularly strong. I'm already at the peak, but my peak doesn't reach the level of others' Heavenly King status!"

It's not that he lacked deep understanding or Daofuse, but his Path of Endurance was only so strong. Even at its peak, without mastering a Great Dao, he might not reach the so-called Heavenly King Realm.

Su Yu frowned, looking at him. "Do you have a way?"

The Great Zhou King thought for a moment, nodding. "I do!"

He took a deep breath, "If Emperor Yu hadn't asked, I wouldn't have mentioned it. But since you did... I want your advice."

"Go ahead."

The Great Zhou King spoke solemnly, "Currently, mastering the rules of the Great Dao is incredibly difficult! My Path of Endurance has reached its end! Advancing further... seems hopeless! But over the years, I haven't been without gains! Endurance isn't just one type; there are many!"

He looked at Su Yu. "Making others endure is one form of endurance! Self-restraint is another! Learning from Hongmeng, being immovable as a mountain, is also a form of endurance!"

Su Yu nodded.

The Great Zhou King continued, "I served as a scribe under the Human Emperor, gaining considerable knowledge and hearing much..."

"No more hiding?"

Su Yu teased, and the Great Zhou King smiled wryly, "It's not hiding, just... some things aren't necessary to mention."

He didn't dwell on it and continued, "Back then, the Culture King and the Human Emperor once discussed the Great Dao. I was present. They mentioned that similar types of paths could actually be combined!"

"For example, the Path of the Blade: long blade, short blade, broadsword, dagger... these paths can ultimately merge! Essentially, they're the same, and the Great Daos opened are close together, as this area is most suitable for opening the Path of the Blade!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

The Great Zhou King went on, "The Path of Endurance is similar. I've been comprehending other forms of endurance and have made some progress! So, I want to try comprehending another Path of Endurance, merging the two. This way, I can quickly enter Daofuse on another Path of Endurance. If I can connect the two paths, it would strengthen the Great Dao, allowing me to enter the quasi-king realm!"

"Opening a Great Dao on the River of Time is beyond my reach... but if I can establish a small river between the Paths of Endurance, I believe I can do it!"

He looked at Su Yu. "Emperor Yu, you... haven't taken me through the River of Time. If you could show me the splendor of the Great Dao, I believe... I still have hope!"

Su Yu smirked, "You're not honest. I don't find you reliable, so I'm reluctant to take you."

The Great Zhou King smiled wryly, "I'm not a bad person. I just uphold the Torchbearer's philosophy, which is also the Human Emperor's philosophy. My goal is to pass on the flame, not to serve any particular Human Lord..."

"And now?"

Su Yu looked at him, and the Great Zhou King sighed, "Now... I'm wavering. Perhaps this tide is the last chance, so I hope to become stronger and contribute more to Emperor Yu."

Su Yu chuckled, "Is that the truth?"

"The truth!"

Su Yu laughed, "Well, regardless of truth or falsehood, you've helped me a lot. Once we find the River of Time, or descend to the lower realm, I'll help you examine the Great Dao. Merging two paths and establishing a connection between them is something I've never seen or heard of before. Perhaps... it will give me some insights."

The essence of similar Daos can be unified. This was something Su Yu was learning for the first time. The Great Zhou King's path of endurance was unique, but evidently, the original creator of this path might not have been powerful enough, resulting in a rather weak Dao. As such, reaching only the peak of the Daofuse Realm, he had not yet attained the Heavenly King Realm. Unless the Great Zhou King could directly master the Great Dao and become the master of the laws!

"Thank you, Emperor Yu!" The Great Zhou King expressed his gratitude, feeling a sense of relief. In this era, he realized that merely being at the peak of the Daofuse Realm was no longer sufficient. If he didn't step into the Heavenly King Realm soon, he might gradually be left behind. The potential of the path of endurance seemed limited, and from the current perspective, if he didn't attempt something new, he might remain at the peak of the Daofuse Realm for the rest of his life.

As the two conversed, there was a ripple in the water. Soon, two women emerged. The valiant General Yingwu exuded an imposing aura, while the woman beside her appeared much gentler, as soft as water. At this moment, General Yingwu quickly addressed the woman beside her, "Yun Shui, this is the Human Lord of this generation, Su Yu! He's quite pitiable, being used as a puppet by others! However, he's still young and has the heart to restore the human race's situation. It's just that he has too few people supporting him. If you and I come out to assist him, we might not be able to completely overpower Hundred Battle's forces, but at least we can increase his authority and give him more hope of becoming a true Human Lord!"

There was a sense of setting things right and clearing the court of traitors. General Yingwu introduced Yun Shui Marquis to Su Yu, then quickly turned to Su Yu and said, "Human Lord, this is Yun Shui Marquis! With the help of Yun Shui Marquis and me, you will have a bit more hope!"

General Yingwu sighed, "However, planning is up to humans, but success is up to the heavens! Whether the Human Lord can truly shed the puppet identity... that depends on you!"

There was a touch of regret. With just her and Yun Shui Marquis, the difficulty was still significant. They could only do their best and leave the rest to fate.

Yun Shui Marquis glanced at Su Yu, then at the Great Zhou King, a faint doubt flickering in her eyes. Yingwu had told her that this Human Lord Su Yu was in a pitiful state. Too young, he was coerced by Zhou Tiansheng and others, used as a puppet. Yet, just a moment ago, when they appeared, she clearly saw Zhou Tiansheng showing respect to Su Yu, with a sense of reverence.

With these thoughts in mind, Yun Shui Marquis slightly bowed and said, "Yun Shui greets the Human Lord!"

Su Yu smiled, "You're too kind! With Yun Shui Marquis willing to come out and assist, our hope increases by threefold!"

Yun Shui Marquis gently replied, "The Human Lord praises too much. The human race is in decline, and we should be united against external threats. Yingwu and I are not opposing Hundred Battle for the sake of opposition. Hundred Battle is also a fierce general. If he is willing to fight for the human race, it would be a blessing for us. However, Hundred Battle is not good at planning and strategizing, yet he is immensely powerful and unwilling to heed our advice..."

She sighed lightly, "Six thousand years ago, we suffered a great defeat, with only one-tenth of the human race surviving. We just don't want the human race to be annihilated like this! If Hundred Battle is unsealed and emerges, we are still willing to resist the myriad races, but we are not keen on being commanded by Hundred Battle."

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Of course!"

A trivial matter! These two thought they couldn't manage, fine, let them think that way. In a few days, they would naturally understand who truly held sway over the human race. Saying too much now was pointless. Women, they only believe what they want to believe. Saying too much now might make them think he was just putting on airs!

Meanwhile, the Great Zhou King also felt a deep sense of emotion. Hundred Battle, you really have no luck with women! The two female generals who survived are both against you, how pitiful!

Su Yu quickly smiled and said, "Let's not dwell on this. Let's go find Fire Cloud Marquis and South Suppression Marquis. Once we deal with these two, the troubles will be completely eliminated!"

With a satisfied expression, Su Yu swiftly led the group away.
