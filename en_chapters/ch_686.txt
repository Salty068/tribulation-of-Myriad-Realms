Chapter 686: Three Marquises Fall

Tiangu relaxed, overjoyed.

*Good!*

*No big deal!*

He let out a furious roar, “Charge into the Human Realm!”

Yes, the Great Zhou King was gone.

At this moment, charging into the Human Realm offered many benefits. If Su Yu and his group returned to reinforce, their surprise attack would fail, and the three Ancient Marquises might even backstab them.

If they didn’t return, the human race had no Daofuse experts. They could eliminate the human race’s Eternal experts and destroy their foundation!

*Did Su Yu think there was only one Marquis in the Life Realm?*

*That you could kill them instantly?*

*What a beautiful dream!*

At this moment, the myriad races also had a tacit understanding. Following Tiangu’s furious roar, Divine Emperor, Phoenix Emperor, Nether Emperor, Ape Emperor, and Heavenly Dragon Marquis all charged out of their realms, heading towards the Human Realm!

*You want to destroy the Life Realm? Let’s see if you can even do it.*

Everyone knew that the Life Realm now had two more Ancient Marquises, and they were top-tier Daofuse experts capable of fighting two, or even three, opponents at once!

Perhaps Su Yu and his group, in their surprise attack, would be counter-killed instead!

*This was truly seeking death by delivering themselves to their doorstep!*

Just then, Su Yu let out a furious roar, bursting from the void, “Primordial Giant King, stop Jiwu!”

Su Yu hadn’t invited the Primordial Giant Race.

Because the situation with this race was peculiar; they had reached some agreement with the Great Zhou King. Su Yu hadn’t asked, and the Great Zhou King hadn’t said, so it was likely related to Hundred Battle King. Thus, Su Yu hadn’t bothered with this race.

But now, if he could borrow their strength, that was best. If not, it didn’t matter; it depended on the Primordial Giant Race’s choice.

Su Yu had contacted various races, and they had all been quite proactive. Only the Primordial Giant Race, ever since their last battle, had kept their realm tightly shut and hadn’t proactively sought out the human race. The Great Zhou King also hadn’t mentioned an alliance with the Primordial Giant Race again.

Based on this, Su Yu could only temporarily consider this race to be neutral.

Su Yu merely shouted; it didn’t matter whether they intercepted or not.

He instantly charged out, pointing his pen towards the Life Realm, striking from afar, the power of the Great Dao reverberating!

At the entrance to the Life Realm, Meteor Marquis and Demonwave Marquis were both startled, then relieved. *Fortunately, we are at the entrance, not inside the realm, otherwise, with the suppressive force, if Su Yu had charged in, it would have been troublesome.*

*Now, it’s great; we can leave the realm at any time!*

The two exchanged glances, both revealing a hint of eagerness.

*Kill Su Yu!*

*Our luck is truly good; Su Yu actually came to us proactively. No wonder Wuming ran; perhaps he sensed something earlier. Of course, it’s normal for the Life Race not to say anything; that race is just like that.*

“Kill!”

With a low roar, the two powerful experts, believing Su Yu was unaware of their presence, instantly charged out of the realm passage!

From afar, Su Yu pointed his pen, but Demonwave Marquis shattered the pen’s phantom with a single punch.

Su Yu’s expression changed drastically!

At this moment, Demonwave Marquis and Meteor Marquis both saw his change in expression.

Clearly, Su Yu seemed unaware of their existence.

“Impossible!”

Su Yu let out a furious roar. The next moment, a ruthless glint flashed in his eyes, “Everyone, hurry! Quick!”

“Too late!”

Demonwave Marquis sneered, crossing the void and instantly charging towards Su Yu!

His aura erupted, immensely powerful!

On the other side, Meteor Marquis also floated like an immortal, a smile on his face, instantly breaking through the void and attacking Su Yu.

At the same time, Abyss Marquis also roared, “Meteor Marquis and Demonwave Marquis have descended! Many powerful experts have already descended from the Upper Realm! Life Race, Kunpeng Race, Golden Crow Race, Three-Headed Demonic Wolf Race, why aren’t you acting to purge the human race?”

*Seize this opportunity to flatten the human race!*

*People from the Upper Realm have arrived.*

*And they are top-tier Ancient Marquises! Older experts, who doesn’t know the power of these two?*

…

At this moment.

Illusory figures appeared in the realms of several ancient races.

In the Three-Headed Demonic Wolf Race, a powerful entity with three heads emerged, showing some surprise and shock. *Demonwave Marquis and Meteor Marquis descended early?*

*Su Yu… he’s going to fall!*

*He had to choose to attack the Life Realm, of all places. The key is that Tiangu and these people are insidious enough to secretly bring down two Ancient Marquises!*

In the myriad races’ confrontation, this tide required taking a side.

Neutrality was impossible.

The Three-Headed Demonic Wolf had actually had ideas for a long time, but had wanted to drag it out. However, upon reflection, if the human race were destroyed and Su Yu killed this time, it would be too late to take a side!

The next moment, a furious roar, and the Three-Headed Demonic Wolf flew out of its realm, shouting, “I come to assist the Ancient Marquises!”

He declared his stance to prevent accidental injury.

At this moment, the most taboo thing was unclear friend-or-foe status.

The Three-Headed Demonic Wolf was the first to fly out of its ancient realm, choosing to join the battle now. He worried there wouldn’t be another chance to act, and then, in the future struggle for dominance among the myriad races, life would be difficult!

He chose to fly towards the Life Realm!

Several powerful experts had already gone to destroy the Human Realm; he didn’t need to get involved there.

At the same time, a Golden Crow covering the heavens and earth with burning flames appeared. An ancient roar came, “Intercept Su Yu’s retreat! Seal the void! Catch them all in one net!”

*Buzz!*

Heaven-burning flames appeared.

A powerful expert of the Golden Crow Race had appeared.

Another moment later, surging waves filled the sky. In the Sea of Stars, the great sea churned. A massive demonic beast, transforming from a Kun to a Peng, spread its wings and soared high, blotting out the sky and sun. It let out a sharp cry, “The Kunpeng Race assists everyone in slaying Su Yu!”

They had all taken sides!

When Meteor Marquis and Demonwave Marquis suddenly appeared, the three ancient races chose to take sides, fearing there wouldn’t be another chance.

At this moment, all parties smiled.

Their retreat was cut off, and powerful enemies were at their front.

Three Ancient Marquises in front, three Half-Emperors of ancient races behind.

*Could Su Yu’s side still turn the tables?*

The Great Zhou King, Su Yu, Hou Pseudo Emperor, Iron-Eating Ancient Emperor, and Space Ancient Emperor—even if the Great Zhou King’s side seemed to have more than one person, bringing the Book Spirit and Tea Plant, they were still only seven.

It seemed like a lot, but their combat power wasn’t strong enough!

The three Ancient Marquises were far more powerful than the several Emperors of the ancient races.

*The human race is finished.*

At this moment, Tiangu and the others all smiled.

Their retreat was blocked!

The appearance of the two Ancient Marquises triggered a chain reaction, instantly leading to the three ancient races taking sides.

And this, in fact, was within expectations.

Su Yu probably hadn’t expected that this surprise attack wouldn’t just add two Ancient Marquises, but also three powerful experts from ancient races—a total of five Daofuse experts. Not only were the previous losses completely replenished, but they were even stronger!

…

Su Yu’s expression changed!

Demonwave Marquis and Meteor Marquis both saw his change in expression and smiled.

*Are you dumbfounded?*

*Too young!*

*Is the Life Realm so easy to raid?*

*Also, the three ancient races would take sides sooner or later, and nine out of ten would side with the myriad races. Did you humans really think you won?*

*It’s just that there hadn’t been a battle before.*

“Meteor, Abyss, go stop the others. I will kill this brat!”

Demonwave Marquis let out a hearty laugh. *Boom!* His fist shadow covered the heavens and earth, unleashing ten thousand illusory punches, striking Su Yu’s pen dao from afar. Su Yu also waved his pen, piercing through the void!

On the other side, the Space Ancient Beast Half-Emperor was the first to arrive. Abyss Marquis instantly left his realm and charged towards him.

Close behind, June wielded a large bamboo staff, shattering the void with a single strike, joining forces with the Space Beast Emperor to fight him.

Abyss Marquis was a bit weaker, but he was still an Ancient Marquis.

Seeing this situation, Meteor Marquis went to meet the Great Zhou King and his group. The Great Zhou King’s side felt like more than one person, but Meteor Marquis was confident that even if he couldn’t defeat their combined forces, these few wouldn’t be able to do anything to him for a while!

On the last side, Hou Pseudo Emperor flew towards Su Yu, preparing to help Su Yu fight Demonwave Marquis!

At this moment, throughout the entire Allheaven Battlefield, powerful auras connected one after another.

Dozens of Daofuse auras blotted out the sky!

On the Dragon Realm side, Heavenly Dragon Marquis had originally intended to go to the Human Realm. Now, seeing this situation, he also quickly flew towards the Life Realm!

Killing Su Yu and his group was the core objective!

*Su Yu and his group probably can’t escape now!*

…

Heavendoom Ancient City.

At this moment, the ancient city trembled. All living beings within the ancient city were shaken, fearful, terrified, and panicked.

*Another great battle has begun!*

Su Yu had proactively launched an attack on the Life Realm, but… the outcome didn’t seem too favorable.

In an old house within the ancient city.

The four Mountain Sea experts, seemingly from the Upper Realm, were all incredibly solemn, “Su Yu started a war, but… it’s simply… simply foolish. It’s over. Once the Lower Realm is destroyed, the Upper Realm… this…”

Su Yu starting a war was a good thing.

As the Great Zhou King said, the few of them had indeed come to connect with the Lower Realm, to create pressure in the Lower Realm, kill some Eternal experts, and tie down some powerful experts in the Upper Realm.

However, they hadn’t asked the human race to go all out and fight a war of annihilation!

“Foolish!”

“The disparity in strength is too great; he’s squandered the previous advantage!”

“Too arrogant, too young!”

The few of them were both angry and sorrowful, their emotions complex.

On one hand, they didn’t want the human race to lose. On the other hand, they were angry at Su Yu’s foolish decision to go all out and fight. On yet another hand, they had some hope: *Don’t be annihilated; kill a few Daofuse experts of the myriad races, and the Upper Realm will be in turmoil, perhaps shifting the encirclement of the human race in the Upper Realm.*

In short, at this moment, the few of them both hoped the human race could win, and also thought, *Su Yu is so foolish, he deserves to die!*

*It’s infuriating!*

They had descended to observe and gather intelligence on Su Yu, and also had the duty to collect information on this generation’s Human Lord and relay it back to the Upper Realm for the old fogeys there to make a judgment.

Now, there was no need for judgment; Su Yu had brought about his own demise!

“Alas, the Great Zhou King actually didn’t stop him. He should be a Torchbearer, right??”

“Perhaps!”

“We can’t stay in the ancient city any longer. Once they lose, the ancient city will probably be destroyed. We must evacuate quickly!”

“…”

The few of them spoke for a while, preparing to evacuate quickly!

But at this moment, the ancient city’s barrier rose. Heavendoom roared, “Everyone return to the old houses! No entry or exit! Lord Heavendoom is ready to fight at any time! If you think you can match Lord Heavendoom, feel free to create chaos!”

Upon hearing this, the four frowned; they couldn’t leave.

Within the ancient city was Heavendoom.

A ninth-stage Eternal, a top-tier Eternal.

*Let’s just avoid it for now. If the battle truly reaches the ancient city, we’ll act according to the situation.*

…

All sides were making decisions.

They had even prepared for this to be the last great battle of the Lower Realm.

Su Yu had given them a chance!

*Boom!*

*Crack!* The void was shattered, making a sound like breaking glass. With powerful enemies ahead and several powerful experts closing in from behind, though slower than the Hou Race and other races, they were rapidly converging.

*One wrong step, every step wrong!*

Su Yu had taken the wrong path!

*He sought his own death!*

Otherwise, the myriad races wouldn’t have wanted a great battle to erupt now; they would have preferred to drag it out until the Upper Realm opened.

Demonwave Marquis’s sinister smile was already close at hand. His fist shadow shattered the void, covering the heavens and earth. The Great Dao of laws transformed into a fist, striking Su Yu’s pen dao. Although these Daofuse experts couldn’t pinpoint the exact location of the Great Dao, years of combat experience taught them how to contend with the power of the Great Dao.

In the void, a pen and a fist quickly intertwined.

The pen was like a blade!

From behind, Hou Pseudo Emperor came, devouring the heavens, his power of the Great Dao sweeping towards Demonwave Marquis.

Demonwave Marquis sneered, “You’re courting death! I was an Ancient Marquis; the Devil Race has many Daofuse experts. How could you trash understand how I became a Marquis?!”

In an instant, thousands of fist shadows erupted.

Demonic qi surged into the sky!

Su Yu let out a low roar, using his hand as a pen, inscribing characters one by one.

Seal, Suppress, Crush, Break, Destroy…

Explosions resounded continuously. Countless inscribed characters shattered, and in the void, fist shadows also constantly exploded.

The next moment, all three seemed to have stepped into the River of Time!

This was the scene of Daofuse experts fighting at their peak.

All three seemed to be within the River of Time, with surging waves. Countless waves transformed into fist imprints, and Su Yu also raised a hand, summoning countless pen blades that clashed fiercely in the long river!

Pen blades shattered, and fist shadows exploded.

To outsiders, it seemed as if none of the three moved, but beneath them, corpses constantly fell. Those were the consumed power of the Great Dao, just like the Old Turtle’s battle with Sky-Gazing Marquis in the past.

The fallen figures were all their rule avatars.

This was more perilous than close combat; a slight misstep meant the collapse of one’s Great Dao.

All sides moved at extreme speed.

At this moment, Su Yu’s side seemed to have completely fallen into a disadvantage.

Feiqiu and Doubao were repeatedly forced back by Tiangu and Talisman King. On the Devil Realm side, although Demonic Halberd and Demonic Leap were no match for the Old Turtle, Ape Emperor, who was near the Devil Realm, quickly arrived to assist in the battle instead of going to the Human Realm!

The three powerful experts joining forces could barely hold back the Old Turtle!

*Su Yu is finished!*

At this moment, the Primordial Giant King did not act.

Su Yu’s side was short one Daofuse expert, while the myriad races had five more Daofuse experts. Sky-Gazing Marquis and Duobao hadn’t appeared yet, but they had also sensed the turmoil in the endless void. Those two were far away, but they probably sensed the commotion and were rushing over!

…

“Su Yu, you’ve lost!”

Demonwave Marquis let out a hearty laugh. *Tiangu overestimated this guy!*

Su Yu’s expression was grim; he didn’t speak.

He was thinking, *How long would it take the Great Zhou King and his group to kill Meteor Marquis?*

Of the five powerful experts, the Great Zhou King was ranked second-tier by Su Yu, Great Qin King and Great Xia King third-tier, and Book Spirit and Tea Plant fourth-tier. As for Meteor Marquis, at most, he was on the edge of second-tier, or third-tier.

*Would it take long to kill him?*

*These five could even contend with a Heavenly King!*

“Lost?”

Su Yu snorted coldly. Pen blades flew out from the River of Time. Countless pen blades charged out, “I still have Feiqiu! How could I lose?”

He sounded somewhat hysterical.

Demonwave Marquis sneered. He had heard of it, a dog, right?

The key was, Divine Emperor and the others were all charging towards the Human Realm. Many Daofuse experts had gone. Could one dog stop them all?

*Today, we’ll wipe you all out!*

*Boom!*

In the long river, battle erupted again. Hou Pseudo Emperor continuously supported Su Yu, allowing Su Yu to fight Demonwave Marquis. The three of them fought, causing massive waves in the long river!

Demonwave Marquis wasn’t worried.

Reinforcements from behind were coming.

…

Meteor Marquis had the same thought.

*Just hold them back!*

*The Great Zhou King has arrived, no problem. I also sensed several Daofuse auras. It’s fine; these guys won’t be able to do anything to me for a while. What am I afraid of?*

*Behind me are all our people!*

When the Great Zhou King arrived, he didn’t do anything else. He instantly set up a large array, with array plates covering the void. It had no other function; its only purpose was to interfere with everyone’s vision.

Meteor Marquis swept his sword, shattering the nearby void. He felt it was inappropriate and didn’t want the Great Zhou King to set up this array.

The Great Zhou King said nothing, continuing to set up the array.

After a period of entanglement, the Great Zhou King finally revealed a character.

On the character, four figures appeared.

Meteor Marquis was slightly stunned. *Who were the other two?*

Stunned or not, it didn’t hinder his combat. He primarily defended, not intending to clash head-on with these few.

However, at this moment, all four erupted simultaneously.

Far more powerful than Meteor Marquis had imagined!

Especially Great Xia King and Great Qin King. Under their combined attack, a primordial giant beast seemed to appear in the void, opening its massive mouth and biting down on the long sword!

*Crunch!*

The long sword snapped, completely broken.

“Pfft!”

A mouthful of golden blood spurted out. Meteor Marquis’s face changed. *This… impossible!*

*Where did these two top-tier Daofuse experts come from?!*

Their combined strength was unimaginably powerful. Just these two together, he would likely lose, let alone with the Book Spirit and the others.

“In the early days of Yong’an, the long river was turbulent. I locked it with iron chains. It was originally an ancient Dao that gained sentience, becoming an evil spirit, harming all living beings. Destroy its evil spirit, capture its Great Dao…”

At this moment, the Book Spirit recited some text that had not been read before.

Just then, a figure appeared in the void, an illusion, holding chains. Only its back was visible. A chain locked the Great Dao—Meteor Marquis’s Great Dao. The Book Spirit’s body trembled. Meteor Marquis roared, shaking his Great Dao, unwilling to be locked!

And at this moment, the Great Zhou King’s Great Dao activated, the Dao of Endurance.

“Everything can be endured. Let him kill me; I remain as still as a mountain…”

He muttered, but it wasn’t for himself to endure. Instead, his Great Dao influenced Meteor Marquis. A thought suddenly arose in Meteor Marquis’s mind: *I endure!*

*I’ll let them kill me!*

*I’ll endure and not move!*

*If I don’t move, if I endure, they can’t kill me.*

Such a thought was so strong, so intense, that his boiling Great Dao power paused for a moment.

Soon, he frantically shook his head, his eyes filled with horror. He seemed to have been interfered with.

The next moment, the Great Zhou King muttered again, “A calm heart brings peace. Kill me, slander me; the physical body is but a skin. What harm is there in enduring for a moment?”

*Boom!*

A loud bang. A desolate beast bit off Meteor Marquis’s arm. In intense pain, Meteor Marquis’s Great Dao trembled, and he instantly sobered up, just about to retaliate.

The Great Zhou King then murmured, “I shall become a saint, offering my body to demons. Endure him!”

*Crunch!*

His other hand was bitten off. Meteor Marquis frantically shook his head. *No, this isn’t right, I can’t endure!*

*Both my hands have been eaten, how can I still endure?*

*I can’t endure this!*

*I must retaliate, I must counterattack, I must kill the enemy before me.* His eyes were somewhat frantic, somewhat muddled.

The Great Zhou King’s power of the Great Dao was also incredibly strong. At this moment, sweat dripped from his forehead as he muttered, “Endure him! Let him be strong; I will endure him…”

“No… I can’t endure…”

Meteor Marquis’s eyes flickered intensely. He struggled frantically, but lost his composure, retaliating wildly.

And Great Qin King and Great Xia King, with their centuries of combat experience, were also inwardly shocked. Great Qin King couldn’t help but curse inwardly, *Damn!*

*This old Zhou fellow is sinister!*

*Endure?*

*They’re almost cutting off his head, and he’s still telling him to endure. The key is, Meteor Marquis was first locked by the Book Spirit’s Great Dao,
