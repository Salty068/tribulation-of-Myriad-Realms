Chapter 686: The Fall of Three Marquises

Tiangu relaxed, feeling a sense of joy. Fortunately, the situation wasn't as dire as it seemed. With a loud shout, he commanded, "Charge into the Human Realm!"

Indeed, the Great Zhou King had left. Now was the perfect time to invade the Human Realm. If Su Yu and his allies returned to defend, their surprise attack would fail, and perhaps the three ancient marquises could even launch a counterattack. If they didn't return, the humans, without any Daofuse experts, would be vulnerable, and their Eternal foundation could be destroyed.

Did Su Yu really think there was only one marquis in the Fate Realm? Did he believe they could be so easily defeated? What a naive thought!

At that moment, the various races seemed to reach a consensus. Following Tiangu's shout, the God Emperor, Phoenix Emperor, Nether Emperor, Ape Emperor, and Heavenly Dragon Marquis all charged out of their realms, heading towards the Human Realm.

"You think you can destroy the Fate Realm? Let's see if you can even manage that."

Everyone knew that the Fate Realm had gained two more ancient marquises, top-tier Daofuse experts capable of taking on two or even three opponents at once. Perhaps Su Yu and his group, in their surprise attack, would end up being counter-killed instead. This was truly a suicidal move!

At this critical moment, Su Yu's voice boomed as he emerged from the void, "Ancient Giant King, stop Jiwu!"

Su Yu hadn't invited the Ancient Giant Race. There was something off about them, and they seemed to have reached some agreement with the Great Zhou King. Su Yu hadn't inquired, and the Great Zhou King hadn't mentioned it either. It likely had something to do with the Hundred Battle King, so Su Yu left them alone. However, if he could leverage their strength now, it would be ideal. If not, it didn't matter. It was up to the Ancient Giant Race to decide.

Su Yu had reached out to various races, and most were proactive, except for the Ancient Giant Race. Since their last battle, they had closed their realm and hadn't sought out the humans. The Great Zhou King hadn't mentioned an alliance with them either. Thus, Su Yu considered them neutral for the time being. He merely called out, leaving it up to them whether to intercept or not.

In an instant, he charged forward, his pen striking towards the Fate Realm, shaking the power of the Great Dao from afar!

At the entrance of the Fate Realm, Marquis Falling Star and Marquis Demon Wave were startled but then relieved. Fortunately, they were at the entrance and not inside the realm, where suppression would be an issue. If Su Yu had managed to break in, it would have been troublesome. Now, they could exit at any time!

The two exchanged glances, a hint of excitement in their eyes. Kill Su Yu! What luck that Su Yu had come to them. No wonder Wuming fled; perhaps he sensed something beforehand. Of course, it was typical for the Fate Race not to mention it. That's just how they were.

"Kill!"

With a low shout, the two powerful beings, thinking Su Yu was unaware of their presence, charged out of the realm passage!

In the distance, Su Yu's pen strike was shattered by a punch from Marquis Demon Wave. Su Yu's expression changed dramatically!

At this moment, both Marquis Demon Wave and Marquis Falling Star saw his change in expression. Clearly, Su Yu seemed unaware of their presence.

"Impossible!"

Su Yu roared furiously, his eyes flashing with determination. "Hurry, someone come, quickly!"

"Too late!"

Marquis Demon Wave sneered, crossing the void to attack Su Yu with overwhelming power!

Meanwhile, Marquis Falling Star, with a smile and ethereal aura, also broke through the void to attack Su Yu.

Simultaneously, Marquis Abyss roared, "Marquis Falling Star, Marquis Demon Wave have descended. Many strong beings from the Upper Realm have descended. Fate Race, Kunpeng, Golden Crow, Three-headed Demon Wolf, why aren't you taking action to cleanse the humans?"

Take this opportunity to flatten the humans!

The Upper Realm had sent reinforcements. And they were top-tier ancient marquises, ancient powerhouses known for their strength.

...

At this moment, several ancient race realms showed projections.

In the Three-headed Demon Wolf Race, a formidable being with three heads appeared, showing a look of surprise and shock. Marquis Demon Wave and Marquis Falling Star had descended early?

Su Yu... was about to fall!

What bad luck, to attack the Fate Realm, and Tiangu and the others had sneakily brought down two ancient marquises!

In this battle of the myriad races, one must choose a side. Neutrality was not an option.

The Three-headed Demon Wolf Race had long considered this, but they had delayed as much as possible. However, realizing that if the humans were annihilated and Su Yu killed, it would be too late to choose a side later. In the next moment, with a fierce howl, the Three-headed Demon Wolf flew out of their realm, declaring, "I come to assist the ancient marquises!"

They made their stance clear to avoid friendly fire. At this moment, the greatest fear was not knowing friend from foe.

The Three-headed Demon Wolf was the first to fly out of the ancient realm, choosing to join the battle now, fearing there might not be another chance. If the myriad races fought for supremacy later, life would be difficult!

He chose to fly towards the Fate Realm! The major powerhouses had gone to the Human Realm, so he didn't need to get involved there.

Simultaneously, a blazing Golden Crow covered the sky, an ancient voice commanding, "Intercept Su Yu and his group, seal the void, and capture them all!"

"Buzz!"

The burning flames appeared. The Golden Crow Race's powerhouses had arrived.

In another moment, the sea roared, and in the Sea of Stars, the ocean trembled. A massive beast transformed from Kun to Peng, soaring high and blocking out the sky, letting out a fierce cry, "The Kunpeng Race assists in slaying Su Yu!"

They had all chosen sides!

With the sudden appearance of Marquis Falling Star and Marquis Demon Wave, three ancient races chose sides, fearing there might not be another chance.

At this moment, powerhouses from all sides smiled.

Their retreat was cut off, and powerful enemies lay ahead.

Three ancient marquises in front, three ancient race half-emperors behind.

Could Su Yu's side still turn the tide?

The Great Zhou King, Su Yu, Hou Pseudo Emperor, Iron Devourer Ancient Emperor, Space Ancient Emperor—even if the Great Zhou King seemed to have more than one person with him, including the Book Spirit and Tea Plant, there were only seven of them.

It seemed like a lot, but their combat strength wasn't strong enough!

The three ancient marquises were far stronger than the ancient race emperors.

The humans were finished.

At this moment, Tiangu and the others smiled.

Their retreat was blocked!

The appearance of the two ancient marquises triggered a chain reaction, leading to three ancient races choosing sides.

And this was actually expected.

Su Yu probably didn't anticipate that this surprise attack would involve not just two ancient marquises, but also three ancient race powerhouses, making a total of five Daofuse experts. The losses from last time were not only compensated but even stronger!

...

Su Yu's expression changed!

Both Marquis Demon Wave and Marquis Falling Star saw his change in expression and laughed.

Caught off guard, weren't you?

Too young!

Did you think the Fate Realm was so easy to attack?

Moreover, the three ancient races were bound to choose sides eventually, and ninety percent of the time, they would side with the myriad races. Did you humans really think you had won?

It was just that the battle hadn't erupted yet.

"Falling Star, Abyss, go block the others. I'll kill this brat!"

Marquis Demon Wave laughed heartily, his fist covering the sky, unleashing countless shadows, striking towards Su Yu from afar, while Su Yu also wielded his pen to pierce through the void!

Over there, the Space Ancient Beast Half-Emperor was the first to arrive, and Marquis Abyss immediately exited the realm to attack him.

Following closely, June wielded a large bamboo, breaking through the void to join the Space Beast Emperor in battle.

Marquis Abyss was weaker, but still an ancient marquis.

Marquis Falling Star, seeing the situation, prepared to confront the Great Zhou King and his group. The Great Zhou King's side seemed to have more than one person, but Marquis Falling Star was confident that even if he couldn't defeat them, they wouldn't be able to easily defeat him either!

On the other side, Hou Pseudo Emperor flew towards Su Yu's side, ready to help Su Yu fight Marquis Demon Wave!

At this moment, the entire Allheaven Battlefield was filled with powerful auras, one after another.

In the Dragon Realm, originally, the Heavenly Dragon Marquis intended to go to the Human Realm. Seeing the situation, he quickly flew towards the Fate Realm!

Killing Su Yu and his group was the core objective!

Su Yu and his group, it seemed, couldn't escape!

...

Heavendoom Ancient City.

At this moment, the ancient city trembled, and all the living beings within the ancient city were shaken, filled with fear, dread, and panic.

Another great battle was coming!

Su Yu had initiated the attack on the Fate Realm, but... the outcome didn't seem favorable.

In an ancient house within the city.

Four Mountain and Sea experts, suspected to be from the Upper Realm, were extremely heavy-hearted. "Su Yu initiated the war, but... it's simply... simply foolish. It's over. If the lower realm is destroyed, the Upper Realm... this..."

Su Yu initiating the war was a good thing.

As the Great Zhou King said, they were indeed here to connect with the lower realm, to create pressure, kill some Eternals, and restrain some Upper Realm powerhouses.

But they hadn't intended for the humans to go all out in a war of annihilation!

"Foolish!"

"The power gap is too large, squandering the previous advantage!"

"Too arrogant, too young!"

They were both angry and sorrowful, their emotions complex.

On one hand, they didn't want the humans to lose, but on the other hand, they were angry at Su Yu's foolishness in going all out. Yet, they also hoped that if they weren't annihilated, killing a few myriad race Daofuse experts might cause turmoil in the Upper Realm, potentially diverting the siege on the Upper Realm humans.

In short, at this moment, they hoped the humans could win, but also thought that Su Yu was so foolish that he deserved to die!

It was infuriating!

They had descended to observe and gather intelligence on Su Yu, tasked with collecting information on this generation's Human Lord and reporting back to the Upper Realm for the ancient elders to make judgments.

Now there was no need for judgment; Su Yu had brought about his own demise!

"Sigh, the Great Zhou King didn't stop him. Isn't he the Torchbearer?"

"Perhaps!"

"The ancient city can't stay. If we lose, the ancient city might be destroyed. We must evacuate quickly!"

"..."

They discussed for a while, preparing to evacuate quickly!

At that moment, the ancient city's barrier rose, and Heavendoom's voice boomed, "Everyone return to the ancient houses, no entry or exit allowed. Lord Heavendoom is ready to fight at any moment! If you think you can match Lord Heavendoom, feel free to cause chaos!"

Upon hearing this, the four frowned, unable to leave.

In the ancient city, there was Heavendoom.

An Eternal Nine-Dawn, a top-tier Eternal.

They decided to avoid it for now. If the battle reached the ancient city, they would act accordingly.

...

All sides were making decisions.

Some were even preparing for what they thought might be the last battle in the lower realm.

Su Yu had given them the opportunity!

Boom!

Creak, the void shattered, making a sound like breaking glass. There were powerful enemies ahead, and behind, several powerhouses, though slower than the Hou Race and others, were quickly closing in!

One wrong step, every step wrong!

Su Yu had taken the wrong path!

He was seeking his own death!

The myriad races were reluctant to engage in a full-scale war at this moment, preferring to wait until the Upper Realm opened. Marquis Modang's sinister smile was close at hand, his fist breaking through the void, covering the heavens and the earth. The power of laws transformed into a fist aimed at Su Yu's pen dao. Although these Daofuse cultivators couldn't see the specific location of the dao, years of combat experience had taught them how to fight against the power of the dao.

In the void, a pen and a fist quickly entangled.

The pen was like a blade!

Behind them, the Hou Pseudo Emperor came devouring the heavens, his power of laws swallowing towards Marquis Modang.

Marquis Modang sneered coldly, "Ignorant fool, I am an ancient marquis of the Demon Race, among many Daofuse cultivators. How could you trash understand why I was conferred the title of marquis?"

In an instant, countless fist shadows erupted.

Demonic energy surged into the sky!

Su Yu shouted, using his hand as a pen to inscribe character after character.

Seal, Suppress, Crush, Break, Annihilate...

Explosions rang out continuously as countless inscribed characters shattered, while in the void, the fist shadows also shattered continuously.

The next moment, it seemed as if the three of them had stepped into the River of Time!

This was the pinnacle of Daofuse combat.

The three seemed to be in the River of Time, waves surging, countless waves transforming into fist imprints. Su Yu also raised his hand, countless pen blades appearing, slaughtering each other in the river!

Pen blades shattered, fist shadows exploded.

To outsiders, it seemed as if the three hadn't moved, but corpses kept falling beneath them, representing the consumption of their power of laws, much like the old turtle's past battle with the Heavenly Overseer Marquis.

The fallen figures were their incarnations of rules.

This was more perilous than physical combat; a slight misstep could lead to the shattering of one's dao.

Both sides moved at extreme speeds.

At this moment, it seemed as if Su Yu's side was at a complete disadvantage.

The God-Eating Two Balls were being pushed back repeatedly by Tiangu and the Symbol King. On the demon side, although Demon Halberd and Demon Leap were no match for the old turtle, the nearby Ape Emperor from the Demon Realm quickly arrived, choosing to assist in the battle instead of heading to the Human Realm!

The three powerful beings joined forces, barely managing to hold off the old turtle!

Su Yu was finished!

At this moment, the Ancient Giant King did not make a move.

Su Yu's side was short one Daofuse cultivator, while the myriad races had five more. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao hadn't appeared yet, but they could feel the turbulence in the endless void. Those two, sensing the commotion, were likely on their way!

...

"Su Yu, you've lost!" Marquis Modang laughed heartily, Tiangu had overestimated this guy!

Su Yu's face was grim, but he said nothing.

He was thinking, how long would it take for the Great Zhou King and the others to kill Marquis Meteor Star?

Five powerful beings, with the Great Zhou King ranked as second-tier by Su Yu, the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King as third-tier, the Book Spirit and Tea Plant as fourth-tier, while the opposing Marquis Meteor Star was at most on the edge of second-tier or third-tier.

Would it take long to kill him?

These five could even hold off a Heavenly King!

"Lost?"

Su Yu snorted coldly, pen blades flew out from the River of Time, countless pen blades slashing, "I still have Fat Ball, how could I lose?"

He seemed somewhat hysterical.

Marquis Modang sneered, he had heard about a dog, right?

The key was, the God Emperor and the others were all attacking the Human Realm, with multiple Daofuse cultivators going there. Could a single dog stop them all?

Today, they would annihilate them all!

Boom!

In the river, the battle erupted once more, the Hou Pseudo Emperor continuously supporting Su Yu, allowing him to fight Marquis Modang, the three of them causing the river to surge with massive waves!

Marquis Modang wasn't worried.

Reinforcements were on their way.

...

Marquis Meteor Star had the same thought.

Just entangle the opponent!

The Great Zhou King had arrived, but it didn't matter, he could also sense several Daofuse auras, no problem, these guys couldn't kill him in a short time, what was there to fear?

The rest were our people!

As soon as the Great Zhou King arrived, he didn't do anything else but immediately set up a large formation, the formation disk covering the void, with no other purpose than to interfere with the surrounding vision.

Marquis Meteor Star swung a sword, shattering the nearby void, feeling something was amiss, not wanting the Great Zhou King to set up this formation disk.

The Great Zhou King said nothing, continuing to set up the formation.

After a while of entanglement, the Great Zhou King finally revealed a character.

On the character, four figures appeared.

Marquis Meteor Star was slightly stunned, who were the other two?

Stunned as he was, it didn't delay his combat, he mainly defended, not intending to fight these people head-on.

However, at this moment, the four of them erupted simultaneously.

Far stronger than Marquis Meteor Star had imagined!

Especially the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King, under their joint attack, a primordial beast seemed to appear in the void, opening its mouth wide, biting towards the long sword!

Crunch!

The long sword broke, completely shattered.

"Poof!"

A mouthful of golden blood spurted out, Marquis Meteor Star's face changed, this... impossible!

Where did these two top-tier Daofuse cultivators come from!

Under their joint attack, they were unimaginably strong, just the two of them could likely defeat him, let alone with the Book Spirit and others present.

"At the beginning of Yong'an, the river is turbulent, I use iron chains to lock it, originally an ancient dao turned spirit, became an evil spirit, harming all beings, destroy the evil spirit, capture its dao..."

At this moment, the Book Spirit recited some previously unread articles.

At this time, a figure appeared in the void, a phantom, holding chains, only the back was visible, a chain locking the dao, that was Marquis Meteor Star's dao, the Book Spirit's body trembled, Marquis Meteor Star roared, shaking the dao, unwilling to be locked!

And at this moment, the Great Zhou King's dao activated, the Dao of Endurance.

"Everything can be endured, let him kill me, I remain unmoved like a mountain..."

He chanted, but it wasn't himself enduring, rather the dao affecting Marquis Meteor Star, suddenly a thought arose in Marquis Meteor Star's mind, I endure!

I let them kill!

I endure without moving!

I don't move, endure, they can't kill me.

Such thoughts, so strong, strong to the point that his boiling power of laws paused for a moment.

Quickly, he shook his head frantically, eyes showing horror, he seemed to be interfered with.

The next moment, the Great Zhou King chanted again, "A calm heart brings peace, let them kill me, slander me, the flesh is but a shell, endure for a moment, what harm?"

Boom!

A loud noise, a wild beast bit off Marquis Meteor Star's arm, under the intense pain, his dao trembled, instantly awakening, just about to counterattack.

The Great Zhou King murmured again, "I shall become a saint, feed the demon with my body, endure!"

Crunch!

Another hand was bitten off, Marquis Meteor Star shook his head frantically, no, wrong, can't endure!

Both my hands are gone, how can I endure?

Can't endure!

Must counterattack, must fight back, must kill the enemy in front of me, his eyes showed madness, some confusion.

The Great Zhou King's power of laws was also extremely strong, at this moment, sweat dripped from his forehead, chanting, "Endure! Let him be strong, I endure him..."

"No... can't endure..."

Marquis Meteor Star's eyes fluctuated violently, struggling madly, yet somewhat lost his composure, randomly counterattacking.

And the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, with their rich combat experience from hundreds of years of battle, were also shocked in their hearts, the Great Qin King couldn't help but curse inwardly, damn!

Old Zhou, this guy, is sinister!

Endurance?

Almost cut off the guy's head, yet he's still making him endure, the key is, Marquis Meteor Star was first locked by the Book Spirit's dao, then ambushed by them, now interfered by the Great Zhou King, already somewhat confused!

This powerful ancient marquis was almost played to death.

And the Tea Plant, also in a daze, how fun.

She also transformed into countless branches, stealthily binding Marquis Meteor Star's legs, then began to spread to his head, Marquis Meteor Star only roared madly, seemingly unaware of being bound.

And the Great Zhou King, at this moment, couldn't chant too long, continuously shouting, "Endure! Endure him! Endure for a moment, the wind and waves will calm!"

"Must endure!"

"Endure to win!"

"Endure!"

...

Crunch, both legs were shattered, bones broken, blood spilled into the void, Marquis Meteor Star's eyes were confused, yet somewhat clear, opening his eyes, looking at the Great Zhou King, roaring, "No, can't endure..."

"Endure!"

"No..."

The power of laws from both sides continuously entangled.

The next moment, the Great Xia King and the Great Qin King exchanged a glance, at this moment, neither was in a hurry, both gathering strength, preparing to kill the opponent in one strike!

It felt... very easy to fight!

Both showed smiles, the next moment, a blade and a spear, continuously gathering strength, continuously growing stronger, right in front of Marquis Meteor Star, gathering strength, growing stronger.

In the void, the wild beast also grew stronger, its massive limbs continuously trampling the void, preparing to crush the opponent's dao with one stomp!

Gathering strength!

The Great Zhou King cursed inwardly, I'm consuming a lot.

These two bastards, so relaxed!

"Endure him!"

"No..."

Both sides repeated this scene, and the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, also completed gathering strength, at this moment, in their hands, a spear and a blade, both incomparably powerful.

The next moment, the two exchanged a glance, simultaneously shouting, "Kill!"

Buzz!

The blade and spear descended!

Boom!

A massive sound, shaking the heavens and earth, the dao was locked, at this moment, a wild beast stomped down, with a rumble, crushing the dao!

The blade and spear fell, Marquis Meteor Star's body instantly turned to ash.

His sea of will just appeared, then completely shattered.

"Endure him!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King was still shouting, the others all turned to look at him, the Great Zhou King's face was pale, seeing everyone looking, he took a breath, too lazy to respond.

"Let him endure without crying out in pain!"

The few were speechless.

It felt... very easy to kill.

The next moment, the heavens collapsed, blood clouds gathered, blood rain fell, Marquis Meteor Star, until death, was enduring.

Yes, enduring!

Enduring without crying!

Enduring without shouting!

At the moment of death, he was still thinking, he could endure a little longer, he could, he could hold on.

And then... there was no more.

He was instantly killed by two powerful beings working together.

...

In a distant direction.

The Immortal Realm.

Suddenly shook violently, Tiangu, who was fighting Doubao, was slightly stunned, momentarily dazed.

Really dazed for a moment, a finger was bitten off by Doubao, he didn't even care, instantly retreating, looking back at the Immortal Realm, at this moment, above the Immortal Realm, a massive figure suddenly crashed into the Immortal Realm, collapsing!

The Immortal Realm shook, a natural disaster erupted instantly, countless Immortal Race members perished.

Tiangu instinctively glanced towards the Talisman King. In the distance, the Talisman King was entangled with the Flatbread. Tiangu's gaze was still somewhat dazed; the Talisman King was alive. He wasn't dead! If the Talisman King wasn't dead, then...

Tiangu looked towards the distant Fate Realm. He couldn't see much, but he saw the blood clouds, the blood rain, the rising source qi, the pillar of blood and qi, and the signs of a powerful being's fall...

At this moment, Tiangu was completely stunned. He couldn't help but be dumbfounded. The battle had just erupted. Although it felt like a long time, in reality, some hadn't even reached the battlefield yet. It had been less than 20 seconds. And then, it seemed... the top-tier marquis of his Immortal Race, Marquis Falling Star, seemed to have fallen.

Yes, it wasn't the Talisman King, nor himself, so naturally, it had to be another Immortal Race Daofuse cultivator. Apart from Marquis Falling Star, there was no one else. But he died without any commotion? Without a single shout? Without any warning? No Daofuse cultivator dies so silently. No, the Golden-winged Roc died silently too, but Tiangu remembered that at least he roared once before his death. Yet Marquis Falling Star, this peerless powerhouse, seemed to have died gritting his teeth, without making a sound.

"Impossible!"

At this moment, Tiangu snapped out of it, slapping the Bean Bun back with a roar, "Impossible!" How could it be! There must be a mistake! The celestial phenomena must have been wrong. How could it be possible that Marquis Falling Star died silently just as the battle began? If not for the celestial phenomena, no one would have known!

"It must be the chaos of the rules... it must be!"

He muttered to himself, unable to accept this reality. Marquis Falling Star wasn't like the King of Soldiers, who was heavily injured. He was a Daofuse cultivator from the ancient times, not a weakling among the ancient marquises. If he had been killed in a shocking battle, Tiangu could accept it. But to die so inexplicably, he couldn't accept it as fact!

...

He wasn't the only one. Near Marquis Falling Star, Marquis Devil Dance and Marquis Abyss were also unaware of his death. Until the celestial phenomena appeared, Marquis Devil Dance instinctively looked up at the sky. Was it raining? He hadn't felt that desperate burst of energy from Marquis Falling Star! Just like that, suddenly, a top-tier marquis was gone.

Marquis Devil Dance was slightly dazed, and his next thought was, who died? Until now, he hadn't thought of Marquis Falling Star. It was simply too absurd. The Great Zhou King's "Endure" Dao, combined with several top-tier powerhouses, killed Marquis Falling Star, and everyone found it incredibly absurd. Not just him, even Su Yu found it absurd. I thought you hadn't even started! He hadn't felt it either because the battle over there wasn't intense. The Great Zhou King had set up an array disk upon arrival and sealed it with the Dao of Silence. If not for the celestial phenomena, perhaps no one would have known someone had died.

And soon, Su Yu snapped out of it! Dead! Who cares, as long as it wasn't one of ours, it was fine. The pen knife slashed through the air! It slashed towards Marquis Devil Dance, specifically targeting his Dao, and Marquis Devil Dance hesitated for a moment. This slash couldn't be avoided, and with a creaking sound, his Dao trembled, and he took a step back, countless thoughts flashing through his mind instantly.

He couldn't fight anymore! Something seemed to have happened! Just as he was thinking this, five strong figures suddenly appeared beside him.

"Kill!"

A loud shout, and Su Yu and the Hou Pseudo Emperor also attacked with all their might! They were here! The five great powerhouses who killed Marquis Falling Star had arrived, seven Daofuse combatants joining forces to kill one person. At this moment, Marquis Devil Dance had no more smiles, only despair! He looked into the distance and saw Marquis Abyss, who was entangled with the Space Ancient Beast Emperor and the Iron Devourer Emperor, looking equally dazed. He looked further away, and Marquis Tianlong was leading three newly joined ancient race powerhouses towards them, not far away. Very close! Give them seven or eight more seconds, and they would probably reach the battlefield.

A battle between powerhouses, no matter how fast, shouldn't be blocked in just a few seconds, right? But the fact was, Marquis Devil Dance knew he... probably couldn't hold on. Seven powerhouses, several of whom felt stronger than him, and the others, only slightly weaker, not by much, including Su Yu. Even if he was weaker, it wouldn't be easy for Marquis Devil Dance to kill him!

"Impossible... why are there two more top-tier Daofuse cultivators?"

He couldn't understand. Why? Where did they come from? Completely unexpected! But it was too late.

"Endure him!"

The Great Zhou King shouted. "Lock the Dao!" The Book Spirit roared. "Open Heaven Blade!" "Slash!" "Stab you to death!" "Devour the heavens!" "..."

Seven great powerhouses roared, going all out. Having killed one, there was no point in hiding anything. They needed to end this quickly, kill Marquis Devil Dance, and then talk. With such a combination, even a Heavenly King would have to consider whether they could withstand it.

At this moment, Marquis Devil Dance showed despair and bitterness. Damn! I'm going to die. Having lived countless years, he never thought he would die like this. Endure? Endure and not cry? Not shout? Such thoughts flashed through his mind. No, I want to be stubborn for once. I'm a peerless powerhouse. How can I be influenced by someone's Dao?

At this moment, Marquis Devil Dance still erupted, demonic energy soaring to the sky, roaring, "I won't endure! It hurts so much! I'm not willing!"

Boom!

Seven great powerhouses struck down! The sky shattered! The earth crumbled, the Dao broke. The Mark of Civilization covered the void, devouring everything, leaving nothing but a massive dark cloud, pouring blood rain. Two ancient powerhouses, powerful marquises, just died like that. Not to mention others, even the seven present were momentarily dazed and bewildered. Wasn't the killing a bit too fast?

In the distance, Marquis Abyss's expression completely changed. Without a word, he fled towards the Fate Realm. It was over! Even if reinforcements were coming, what use were they! Two incredibly powerful marquises were suddenly killed, catching everyone off guard. If he didn't run, was he waiting to die?

At the entrance of the Fate Realm passage, an old man with white hair appeared, looking at Su Yu and the others, then at Marquis Abyss, with some shock and peculiarity. They just killed Marquis Falling Star and the others like that? Even he hadn't expected it! Fine, I want to live a few more years. Whether I die or not, let's talk after the Upper Realm opens. Now, the morale of the Human Race is soaring. I... might as well lend a hand.

The Fate Realm passage was suddenly blocked. The Fate Emperor's palm oozed drops of blood, sealing the entire passage tightly. He spoke, "I'll go check the Upper Realm passage for you, reinforce it a bit, to prevent more people from coming. Two Daofuse cultivators died, there will definitely be a commotion. You're welcome!"

Without waiting for Su Yu to speak, he quickly disappeared! Don't come to my Fate Realm to fight, I'm afraid the Fate Realm will be blown up. You just block Marquis Abyss outside and kill him. I'll help you seal the Upper Realm passage, temporarily preventing more people from coming.

The Fate Emperor flew towards the Upper Realm passage, his heart pounding. Scared to death! He was strong, stronger than Marquis Falling Star, but those two weren't weak either, and they just died like that. How could he not be afraid?

At the same time, with a bang, Marquis Abyss crashed outside the passage. He showed some despair! Given time, he could break the seal. This seal wasn't too strong. But he didn't have time. He wasn't facing seven Daofuse cultivators, but nine! More than Marquis Devil Dance! Nine! And his strength wasn't even as good as Marquis Devil Dance's.

At this moment, Marquis Abyss suddenly said, "I surrender, I admit defeat, don't kill me!"

"Kill!"

Su Yu shouted, and the nine great powerhouses attacked again! Surrender for what, what use are you? Three ancient marquises? All go to hell!

"Endure him!"

The Great Zhou King's voice rose again, and everyone felt their scalps tingling, experiencing for the first time the sinister and terrifying nature of this guy. Even when being killed, they had to endure. Be a human!

"Kill!"

Boom! The sky collapsed, and this time, the heavens were shattered again. Nine top-tier beings attacking Marquis Abyss, it was too easy. With a loud bang, Marquis Abyss didn't even have time to leave any last words. His body disappeared instantly, his Dao broke, dark clouds appeared, blood rain fell, the celestial phenomena were not small, but the person being killed didn't make much noise.

The Mark of Civilization swept through again! Only a black hole could be seen, piercing through the Fate Realm. They couldn't stop in time, even the entrance to the Fate Realm was rendered void. Three ancient marquises, the battle was resolved in less than a minute. All perished!

At this moment, all around, the battles stopped. Behind, Marquis Tianlong, with a few Daofuse cultivators, was less than a hundred miles away from them. In an instant, the powerhouses turned and fled! Their faces were filled with terror and horror! What was going on? Three ancient marquises, all died in battle, not surviving even a minute!

...

Further away, Tiangu was also in a daze, and the next moment, he let out a mournful howl, "Retreat! Everyone retreat! Quickly retreat!"

"Escape!"

"Quickly!"

"Attack the Human Realm!"

Attacking the Human Realm was a shout to others, forcing Su Yu and the others to return, all retreating! In the blink of an eye, three marquises were killed. If they didn't flee, he feared even the few with Marquis Tianlong would die! Without his reminder, the powerhouses from all sides, those who hadn't flown far, fled back to their realms. Those who flew quickly to the Human Realm gritted their teeth, with some trepidation, first attacking the Human Realm a bit, forcing Su Yu and the others to return, then preparing to escape.

And behind Marquis Tianlong, the three newly joined powerhouses, Kunpeng, Golden Crow, and Three-headed Demon Wolf, fled at the first opportunity, running swiftly, all in shock. All were horrified, three marquises, just died like that? The promised time to crush the Human Race! All liars! They must be fake marquises! They must be fake! Unable to accept such a reality! Even in ancient times, these three weren't weak, yet they died here, unable to accept such a reality.

...

In the endless void. The newly emerged Heavenly Overseer Marquis, without a word, turned and fled, continuing to escape into the void. In the distance, Duobao, who was peeking, grimaced, his face filled with horror, quickly fleeing, thinking, how do I contact the Human Race, I want to surrender! Really want to surrender, too fast, Su Yu took blitzkrieg to the extreme. With the fastest and most terrifying speed, he cut down three marquises. Otherwise, if they really gathered their forces, the battle might not have been so easy.

In truth, the difference wasn't significant. In fact, Su Yu's side wasn't at an advantage. The Myriad Races had five Daofuse Realm experts, while Su Yu's side only had the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King.

However, the result was the instant death of three marquises.

This was because Su Yu initiated the battle, having complete control over all the intelligence, exploiting the information gap.

The great battle came swiftly and ended even faster.

All the Daofuse Realm experts of the Myriad Races were in full retreat.
