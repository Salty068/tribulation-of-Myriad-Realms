Chapter 752: So What? (Ten Thousand Words for Subscription)

A grand melee swept across the world.

In the depths of Chaos Mountain, a magnificent and splendid spectacle of fireworks lingered for a long time. However, this was the result of the fall of dozens of Daofuse cultivators, more than ten Heavenly Kings, and one Heavenly Sovereign.

Deep within Chaos Mountain, the vast expanse stretched so wide that the gathering mountains blocked out the sky, making it impossible to see the true Upper Realm.

At the peak of the mountains, a figure appeared, hands clasped behind his back, overlooking the world below. In the distance, the fireworks brought back memories for him. The fierce winds howled, yet they did not affect him in the slightest. His golden robe fluttered in the wind, adding an air of elegance.

"Your Majesty!"

The few who had disappeared earlier suddenly reappeared behind him, gazing at his back with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy. Marquis Yunshui looked up, his face filled with tenderness and admiration, his voice trembling slightly, "Your Majesty, Shadow... they have sacrificed themselves!"

The one who had brought them here was an incredibly enchanting woman, who also looked at the man’s back with a smile. That back was as towering as a mountain, making people look up in awe.

"I know," the man said, his back still turned to them, looking into the distance. After a long while, he chuckled lightly, "No worries. When I have time, I'll take a trip to the Lower Realm, walk along the River of Time. Perhaps some remnants of the Great Dao have not yet fallen... let's see if we can retrieve them!"

Marquis Yunshui was instantly overjoyed, "Your Majesty... you..."

The man turned around, looking at everyone with a hint of melancholy and sentiment, yet he smiled, "I won't let my people die in vain! However..."

He looked at them and slowly asked, "Why did such a great battle suddenly erupt?"

"Your Majesty..." Marquis Yunshui quickly replied, "The current Human Lord reached an agreement with the myriad races. With General Xuelan and others returning, he wanted to attack the Chaos Race but underestimated their strength. They had an additional Heavenly Sovereign-level existence... Unwilling to accept defeat, he ordered a fight to the death..."

The man fell into contemplation. After a long while, he spoke, "What do you think of this current Human Lord?"

"His talent is strong, but his strength is average. He is domineering and arrogant..."

The man laughed, "Average strength? I think he's quite capable!"

With that, he turned again, looking towards the distance. After a long pause, he asked, "Yue Luo, does this scene look familiar?"

The enchanting woman, with a smile, looked into the distance at the clouds, and after a long while, she said charmingly, "Familiar! It seems... something similar happened in the past, but that time was even more splendid than now!"

Marquis Yunshui's expression changed slightly, "Your Majesty... do you mean?"

"Just a guess," the man said, looking over there with a smile, "Interesting!"

Very interesting.

It was as if he was seeing the past!

With that, the man chuckled lightly, "Let's go. The Upper Realm is not suitable for staying. Let's head to Soul Burying Mountain and watch the rise and fall of clouds in the Upper Realm! With both sides evenly matched, the fight will surely be interesting!"

Behind him, the enchanting woman softly asked, "What about me?"

"You stay!" The man turned, revealing a smile. On his dignified face, the smile appeared especially warm, "You can't leave. If you do, it will cause significant problems!"

With that, he looked at Marquis Yunshui and the others, smiling faintly, "Is Zhennan in the Lower Realm? I haven't sensed his presence."

"He should be in the Lower Realm... but last time, his physical body self-destructed..."

"No matter!" Hundred Battle said calmly, "The physical body exploded, but for others, recovery is difficult. For me, the path of the physical body belongs to me... rebuilding it is simple!"

"Your Majesty, but the Lower Realm is the territory of the new Human Lord. Are we going to..."

Marquis Yunshui had just spoken halfway when Hundred Battle raised his hand, interrupting her. Looking into the distance, he said solemnly, "Wrong, the Lower Realm is not anyone's territory! Even if it is, it is mine! Moreover... he might have... taken his people and left!"

Marquis Yunshui was shocked!

The enchanting Yue Luo chuckled softly, "What do you mean by that?"

"The ones you saved are all my people!" Hundred Battle said calmly, "What about his people? Are they all dead?"

Marquis Yunshui hurriedly said, "His people were very obedient and all self-destructed... The ones who didn't self-destruct, like Fat Ball, were taken away by him."

Hundred Battle fell into contemplation, and after a moment, he laughed. His tall figure looked exceptionally handsome when he smiled.

"Let's talk while we walk. Tell me more about him; I want to hear!"

"Understood!" Marquis Yunshui responded, quickly adding, "By the way, he took the Human Emperor's Great Dao Map and the Starry Sky Seal!"

Hundred Battle nodded slightly, "The Starry Sky Seal... I searched for it in the past but never found it. It seems this seal and I are not destined! No matter, if he took it, he took it. It doesn't affect anything."

"But..."

"No buts!" Hundred Battle interrupted her again, smiling faintly, "The Human Emperor was strong, but not the only one. If he inherits the Human Emperor's foundation, let him inherit it! This human race, this myriad races, ultimately do not belong to the Human Emperor alone! Besides, even the Human Emperor was only a successor of the Human Ancestor's legacy before becoming the Human Emperor! The Human Ancestor came first, the Human Emperor came after!"

Hundred Battle remained calm and composed, not feeling any discomfort or thinking it inappropriate that Su Yu had inherited the Starry Sky Seal and the Great Dao Map.

Marquis Yunshui quickly said, "He... he might have severed the pen dao. He previously inherited the pen dao."

"Pen dao?" Hundred Battle pondered for a moment, then laughed, "The pen dao is not so easily severed. That path is not weak. How could a quasi-king sever the pen dao? He merely burned his connection. If he wants, he can reconnect at any time, just not use it at the moment!"

A Great Dao is not so easily broken.

This is a true rule-based Great Dao, the one that once achieved the Culture King.

With that, he walked through the air, "Let's go. The Upper Realm is about to descend into chaos. If we stay here and are discovered, it will easily cause trouble!"

Behind him, Marquis Nanxi hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, the giant axe is still in their hands..."

"March is there, and with the current chaotic situation, March should find a way to save him!"

Hundred Battle didn't look back, "Besides, the giant axe... seems not to have fully pledged allegiance to me, so there's no need to worry about him for now!"

"Understood!" Marquis Nanxi obeyed, quickly falling silent.

Soon, the group of five walked through the air, disappearing in an instant.

...

At the same time.

In the Source of the Dao.

Su Yu returned to this place once more, his face pale, yet he wore a smile. He looked back towards the extreme west.

The Source of the Dao was almost deserted at this moment.

Fat Ball, however, was utterly dejected, its tail severed, its body covered in blood. It lamented, "Su Yu, I couldn't beat that guy. I told you, we lost!"

Lost!

This battle was a miserable defeat.

Even though they killed many, they still lost, utterly defeated. Su Yu's years of accumulated strength were completely exhausted in this battle!

"Lost?" Su Yu laughed, "The one who laughs last is the winner. Who can say we've lost now?"

"Still being stubborn!" Nearby, Marquis Tongtian muttered, "We really lost!"

So miserable!

When they came up, they were full of spirit, with talents aplenty. When they went down, they suffered heavy losses, not even one in ten survived!

Truly desolate!

We were defeated.

Su Yu looked at him, smiling, "Are you familiar with Hundred Battle?"

"Not familiar."

"Indeed." Su Yu nodded, "You've always been in the Luminous Domain Mansion, how could you be familiar? Hundred Battle probably rarely went there, or never went at all."

"I've never seen him," Marquis Tongtian nodded, then added, "But if he disguised himself and went in, I wouldn't know!"

Makes sense!

Su Yu laughed, "Perhaps!"

"You can still laugh?" Marquis Tongtian looked at him with a weathered face, "You can still laugh, I get it, you're forcing a smile!"

Too tragic!

A generation's Human Lord, just risen, was beaten down. It's already good that he can maintain his composure.

He lamented, "At the start, when we saw an extra Heavenly Sovereign, we could have run. That way, we wouldn't have ended up like this!"

So many Heavenly Kings and Daofuse cultivators, look, after one battle, they're gone!

Just one dog left!

As for himself, just a portal, what's the use of that!

His strength isn't even second-class!

Su Yu was also beaten to the point where he felt he could crush him now.

Truly desolate!

"A hero's end!" Marquis Tongtian lamented, too tragic. This battle probably shattered Su Yu's confidence completely.

Even if there are still Daofuse cultivators in the Lower Realm, but... there's no way to fight!

In the Upper Realm, there are plenty of Heavenly Sovereigns, even rulers of rules seem to exist!

Su Yu, apart from a dog, only has an old turtle left!

"You could say a few less words!" Su Yu looked at him, eyes unfriendly, "If you can't speak well, just shut up!"

Marquis Tongtian wanted to say more, thinking that Su Yu was so weak now, he wouldn't listen to him either. Just as he thought that, he saw Fat Ball and instantly shut up. Forget it, he still has a dog, and I can't beat it, forget it, forget it, I won't argue with him!

Fat Ball was also dejected, "Su Yu, what do we do now? Can we still save Master?"

We lost!

"Doubao and the others are all dead..." Su Yu laughed, "Who said they're dead? Alright, it's not a big deal! Good news, we won this battle, a great victory!"

It was a great victory!

This battle resolved many doubts and confirmed many suspicions!

Su Yu laughed, "Previously, the strength accumulated too quickly, somewhat superficial. Now, it's just about discarding the dross and retaining the essence! This is called shedding burdens and moving forward lightly, a good thing! Enough talk, let's head to the Lower Realm! Once there, we'll take everything we need, and the rest, leave it to others!"

Su Yu laughed again, "He wasn't wrong, and neither was I, but... he planted people in my ranks, that's his mistake! Making me take the fall, that's also a mistake! We'll settle this score later!"

With that, Su Yu sneered, "Everyone's playing, let's see who plays to the end! Although his strength is slightly stronger than mine, but... no matter how strong, it's not to that extent, otherwise, he would have unified the world long ago! Still lacking a bit, at least can't contend with both sides joining forces!"

Fat Ball was confused, Marquis Tongtian blinked, who is he talking about?

Hundred Battle?

Feels like it!

The human race... is really complicated.

You've been beaten to this state, yet you seem like you've won.

Beside him, the White Dog curiously glanced at Marquis Tongtian and asked, "When you say 'beaten like a dog,' are you referring to me? I am a dog, after all!"

Marquis Tongtian was left speechless and awkward. Su Yu shot him a glance and said, "If you weren't somewhat useful, I'd have already put a muzzle on you to shut you up!"

Marquis Tongtian was taken aback, exclaiming, "The Culture King said the same thing back in the day!"

"I don't want a muzzle!" he hurriedly protested. "If I'm muzzled, how will I open doors freely? It would be such a hassle!"

"Enough with the nonsense!" Su Yu was exasperated. He thought to himself that he should have just put this guy away earlier.

Su Yu once again tore through the River of Time. It was becoming increasingly difficult, but he could still manage to enter. As he stepped onto the Human Emperor's path, he pondered for a moment and suddenly asked, "Fat Ball, who do you think among us bears the greatest responsibility for the Human Race?"

Fat Ball was bewildered. How would it know?

Su Yu seemed not to need an answer from it. He chuckled and mused to himself, "Perhaps... the one with the greatest sense of responsibility is that old fellow! He only cares about the Human Race, about passing on the torch! He doesn't care who the Human Lord is or who takes on the role; he only cares that the legacy of the Human Race endures!"

The Great Zhou King!

He was a unique existence, one whose very purpose was to pass on the torch. He didn't care whether the Human Lord was Su Yu or Hundred Battle King, nor did he care about past grievances. His sole concern was the unbroken inheritance of the Human Race.

However, inheriting this path wasn't simple! The Human Lord, the Starry Sky Seal, the Human Lord Seal, the Heaven Gate... perhaps many conditions were needed. If it were that easy, someone would have inherited it long ago.

Su Yu said no more and continued to walk through the void. At this moment, his pen dao had broken, severing the connection and weakening his strength considerably. Yet, even without merging his dao, Su Yu still possessed top-tier Eternal combat power. Moreover, with his numerous treasures, including a third-tier Daofuse demonic incarnation within his Mark of Civilization, he was confident he could take down a third-tier Daofuse opponent.

The pen dao was just a path; its severance was not the end. Restoring it wouldn't be too difficult. The pen dao was resilient, and with some time, he could regain quasi-king combat strength.

Su Yu soon laughed and said, "Let's take the Fate Clan's passage down. In my current state, I might not make it to the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion!"

The Fate Clan's passage could be suppressed instantly. He could also have a chat with the Fate Emperor along the way. The Myriad Realms were becoming increasingly interesting.

Su Yu felt no disappointment. He was still young; what was there to be disheartened about? No rush! If someone wanted to hold up the sky, it was a good thing—as long as they didn't interfere with him. If they did, even if they were from the Human Race, he wouldn't be polite!

...

Su Yu headed towards the Fate Clan's passage.

At the same time, in the endless void, in the land of endless darkness, a man in white murmured, "I feel... perhaps the flow of time in the Myriad Realms has gone awry. In the blink of an eye, millions of years have passed!"

"Impossible!" said a robust man beside him, covered in blood and disbelief. "Nonsense!"

Why would he think such a thing? A blink equating to millions of years... was he joking?

The man in white ignored him, turning his head to look in a direction and murmuring, "Really! Believe it or not!"

"Why say that?"

"Let me ask you, how long do you think it takes to inherit the pen dao and comprehend over eighty percent of it?"

"Comprehend the pen dao... ten thousand years?"

"Ten thousand years?"

The man in white laughed, "What about a peerless genius?"

"A hundred years?"

"Even if it's a hundred years, let me ask you, how long does it take from comprehending over eighty percent to suddenly severing the pen dao connection?"

"What?"

The robust man was shocked. "Dead? Did they get killed so quickly? Your inheritor got killed? That's too fast; your pen dao isn't weak. How could they be killed so easily..."

The man in white said nothing, only falling into confusion. Had something major happened in the Myriad Realms? Day by day, it hadn't felt long, just a blink, and then... nothing. The last inheritor who had shocked him seemed to have severed the connection with the pen dao in the blink of an eye.

Did they die? Or what?

Was his legacy so easily snuffed out? Having inherited over eighty percent of the pen dao, they should have had quasi-king combat strength, right? Even if they couldn't defeat a ruler of laws, they shouldn't have been killed so quickly, right? How tragic! It had only been a few days!

"Logically, someone inheriting my dao should have had great fortune. How could they be killed so quickly?"

The man in white continued to murmur, then suddenly said, "Do you think they might have severed the dao on purpose to open another path?"

"What?"

The robust man, in the midst of healing, replied in confusion.

The man in white frowned, looking at him with some disdain. "I always feel like talking to you is like a chicken talking to a duck. We can't communicate!"

"Then say less."

The robust man quickly stood up, "Let's go, time to fight!"

The man in white dusted off his robe, frowning slightly at the sight of the robust man's bare torso. "Such a disgrace to culture!"

"Idle nonsense!"

The robust man also showed disdain. "In the end, you'll be covered in blood. I think you should wear a red robe instead!"

"Martial brute's perspective!"

"Anyone who fights is a martial brute. You're cultured; if you're so cultured, don't fight!"

"This isn't fighting; it's a contest of dao..."

"Bah!"

The robust man ignored him, disappearing in an instant. The man in white still showed disdain. "Even the way you leave lacks grace. Sit like a bell, stand like a pine, and walk with elegance!"

"What's the point? No one's watching!"

Ahead, the robust man turned back with disdain, calling him a lunatic! In this ghostly place, there weren't even a few shadows to be seen. Why should he care about such things? Day in and day out, acting all mysterious! Forget it, he couldn't be bothered with him. This guy had been like this for countless years.

Behind him, the man in white shook his head. Just because no one was watching, did that mean he shouldn't care? Indeed, martial brutes would never understand what it meant to have grace!

Forget it, he couldn't manage the affairs of the Myriad Realms, nor did he care to. Day in and day out, it was all strange. In just a few days, one moment there was rapid comprehension, the next the dao was severed. Maybe there would be more changes in a few days. He couldn't manage it!

...

In the Fate Realm, the passage trembled!

The Fate Emperor instantly appeared atop Destiny Mountain, filled with some doubt and peculiarity. It hadn't been long since they went up! What happened? Did something go wrong so quickly? Was it Su Yu returning, or was someone from the Upper Realm coming down?

He watched the sky with some gravity. After a while, a figure appeared, surrounded by thunder, but it was quickly suppressed by a large seal.

At this moment, the Fate Emperor confirmed it was Su Yu! That was the Starry Sky Seal! It was impossible for anyone else to suppress the punitive power of the passage's rules so easily. Otherwise, people from the Upper Realm would have come down long ago.

Just as the Fate Emperor was pondering, a figure appeared. Soon, a door and a dog appeared beside him. The Fate Emperor's heart trembled violently!

Fat Ball had lost its tail. Su Yu's aura seemed to have diminished significantly, and he couldn't even sense the fluctuations of the dao rules!

What... what happened?

What had occurred?

Where were the others?

Countless thoughts flashed through the Fate Emperor's mind. Su Yu, seeing the Fate Emperor waiting there, looked pale and somewhat fatigued. He said calmly, "Fate Emperor, from now on, you don't need to listen to me anymore!"

The Fate Emperor's heart shook violently, and he hurriedly said, "Why does the Emperor Yu say this..."

Su Yu looked at him, his tone still calm, "Defeated! In the battle in the Upper Realm, those who survived... are all here!"

Su Yu smiled, "Well, you're free now! From now on, no one will boss you around! I'm giving up on the Lower Realm too. Perhaps soon, someone will come down to hunt us... I need to take people and retreat! From now on, we'll go our separate ways. Wuming, my friend, you won't stop me, will you?"

Wuming's heart was in turmoil. All the survivors had come down! How could it be! But Su Yu's dao seemed to have collapsed, Fat Ball was severely injured, and although Marquis Tongtian seemed fine, the portal bore traces of battle, slightly damaged.

Could it be... they really lost?

Su Yu, who had always been victorious, had just led a large group of powerful beings to the Upper Realm with great ambition, and in the blink of an eye... he was defeated?

He had retreated!

It was impossible!

Yet, the reality was before him.

His heart was in turmoil, but his face showed nothing. He quickly said, "Even if the Emperor Yu suffered a minor setback this time, I believe he will soon rise again..."

Su Yu smiled, "You're a smart man! Extremely smart! I'm not one to give up easily. I will naturally find a way to rise again! However, your Fate Clan is powerful, and Destiny Marquis is peerless. In my current state, I fear I cannot control your Fate Clan. In that case... let's part on good terms! I'm worried you won't submit, worried Destiny Marquis won't submit. In that case... why not part now and leave some ties? If I return, and you feel you can still ally with me, then come back!"

"With Destiny Marquis here, even if I lost this time in the Upper Realm, all races saw it, and they won't make things difficult for you... Even if they come down, they won't do anything to you!"

The Fate Emperor said heavily, "The Emperor Yu jests. My clan has been neutral for millions of years. Until this tide, I chose the Emperor Yu, not on impulse, but after careful consideration! Otherwise, I would have chosen Hundred Battle in the last tide..."

Su Yu also smiled, "Am I stronger than Hundred Battle? Not necessarily!"

Wuming said solemnly, "At least in one aspect, the Emperor Yu is definitely stronger than Hundred Battle! Racial views are not as distinct for the Emperor Yu! No matter how strong Hundred Battle is, in his eyes, there is only the Human Race! In his eyes, the Human Race is his race, his only... This is something that cannot be concealed, and it is what worries all allied races the most!"

Su Yu looked at him and smiled, "You mean, apart from this, I'm not as good as him?"

Wuming was embarrassed, "I didn't mean that."

"Forget it, maybe you're right."

Su Yu exhaled, "Has anything happened in the Myriad Realms recently?"

"The Emperor Yu hasn't been gone long, so nothing has happened for now. However, it seems there have been some changes in the Immortal, Demon, and God Realms. Perhaps someone has entered the Daofuse Realm!"

Su Yu nodded with a smile, "It doesn't matter! Soon, this lower realm won't be mine anymore! But before that, I'll take everything that belongs to me. As for what doesn't, I'll leave it behind."

The Fate Emperor's expression was heavy. "Emperor Yu... are you planning to retreat? Are you heading to the Death Realm?"

He seemed troubled, and after a moment, he gritted his teeth and said, "If Emperor Yu truly intends to retreat, I suggest not going directly to the Death Realm!"

Su Yu looked at him.

The Fate Emperor spoke solemnly, "Has Emperor Yu forgotten about the Abyssal Realm? The lurking undead! I have an idea. If Emperor Yu truly feels that the Myriad Realms are no longer habitable, you could break the barrier between the Abyssal Realm and the Death Realm! Sink the entire Abyssal Realm into the Death Realm! This way, it would form its own world within the Death Realm, accommodating living beings and shielding them from the interference of death energy!"

"Back then, when the Abyssal Realm sank, this was the idea—to merge into the Death Realm!"

The Fate Emperor quickly continued, "This way, the exit of the Abyssal Realm can be preserved, allowing a return to the realm of the living at any time!"

"No need to use the passageways, as they still have some rules!"

"As long as Emperor Yu can find a way to seal the gap after merging the Abyssal Realm, preventing discovery, hiding in the Abyssal Realm would be more suitable than anywhere else!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and he couldn't help but look at him, suddenly laughing, "You're... acting strange!"

The Fate Emperor was surprised, "What does Emperor Yu mean by this?"

Su Yu laughed, "I lost, you know? A crushing defeat! Maybe you didn't see it, but I'm telling you, apart from us, everyone else died in battle. In the Upper Realm, there are over a dozen Heavenly Sovereigns from the myriad races, and even two rulers of the Chaos Race. Countless Heavenly Sovereigns, and soon, Hundred Battle might descend, with unparalleled strength... Yet here you are, offering me advice. You're acting very strange!"

Wuming smiled, "No, Emperor Yu, I'm not blind! I saw it, but... I'm concerned about Emperor Yu himself, not others. You should know, before this, I was aware of the existence of the Heavenly Sovereigns. I could have informed the Upper Realm, bringing down more powerful beings from the myriad races... but I didn't!"

Wuming smiled, "Because I'm observing fate and fortune! Emperor Yu may not believe it, but if my Fate Clan were to truly ally with the Human Clan, it would only be with Emperor Yu. Unless the ancient Human Emperor returns, we won't ally with any other human!"

Su Yu was surprised, "I don't think I'm that impressive!"

Wuming slightly bowed, "Emperor Yu jests. In three years, you've stirred the winds and clouds of the Myriad Realms. No matter how strong Hundred Battle is, he's just another Martial Emperor, another Martial King... But Emperor Yu, you're different!"

Su Yu truly laughed, "Wuming, my friend... you really like to joke!"

"No!"

Wuming shook his head again, "This is no joke! The Fate Clan will await Emperor Yu's return. Apart from Emperor Yu, no one else shall step into the Fate Realm!"

"Are you sure?"

Su Yu chuckled, "When Hundred Battle arrives, how will you stop him?"

Wuming spoke softly, "Emperor Yu may not believe it, but... I must say, even if Hundred Battle comes, it won't be easy for him to take the Fate Realm! The Fate Clan has remained neutral for a hundred thousand years; it's not something a single Hundred Battle can easily break through!"

Su Yu was taken aback, thinking it was nonsense!

Even if the Destiny Marquis descended and fought Hundred Battle, it would likely end in disaster. Back then, Hundred Battle only hesitated to fight the Destiny Marquis to the death, giving others an advantage.

Seeing Su Yu's disbelief, Wuming smiled, revealing his teeth, "The Fate Realm is connected to the heavens, a race favored by destiny! Here, anything unexpected can happen, and Emperor Yu will thrive here."

"Is that so?"

Su Yu laughed, nodding, "Old man, you're quite interesting, all mysterious and whatnot. Fine, suit yourself!"

With that, Su Yu stepped outside, "The Abyssal Realm... merging with the Death Realm... that's a good idea. I was thinking of creating a realm suitable for living beings."

The Fate Emperor quickly followed, smiling, "I have even more interesting ideas!"

"Let's hear them!"

"Completely sever the connection between the realms of life and death!"

Su Yu was stunned, looking at him, and the Fate Emperor smiled, "Move the thirty-six cities into the Abyssal Realm! These ancient cities can move, as Emperor Yu knows! The entrances in the Death Realm are fixed, but in the realm of the living, they move randomly... As long as all thirty-six ancient cities are moved, apart from the seventh floor of the Xingyue Mansion, there will be no other connections between the realms of life and death!"

"Of course, there's a problem with this!"

The Fate Emperor quickly added, "Moving them all into the Abyssal Ancient Realm will accelerate the Abyssal Ancient Realm's absorption by the Death Realm. The realm of the living merging with the Death Realm will eventually be completely absorbed by the Death Realm over time!"

"Moving the thirty-six cities in will only speed up the process. Perhaps in a hundred years, the entire Abyssal Realm will become part of the Death Realm!"

Su Yu looked at him, "Your idea... seems pretty good!"

Su Yu laughed, "Did you come up with this on a whim?"

"No."

The Fate Emperor admitted, "My clan has long considered this, including the Abyssal Race. Their idea has always been this! The Abyssal Race... don't forget, Emperor Yu, they're also a branch of my Fate Clan! The reason they rebelled back then was due to differing philosophies. They wanted to merge with the Death Realm, creating a great world for the Fate Clan!"

Su Yu was surprised, "You mean... the Human Clan wants to make the Upper Realm their great world, while you want to merge with the Death Realm, claiming it as your territory?"

"That's the idea!"

The Fate Emperor didn't deny it, nodding, "Every race wants a backup plan... but later, my clan gave up."

"Why?"

The Fate Emperor sighed, "No confidence! The risk is too great. More likely, it would turn the Fate Clan into something neither human nor ghost. Short-term survival is possible, but long-term residence in the Death Realm is impossible. They would quickly become undead! We're considering long-term plans, not just temporary refuge. If it's just for refuge... there's no need to do this!"

"Also, Hongmeng and others are obstacles. They won't agree to seal the passageways, but Emperor Yu can... that's the difference."

Su Yu pondered.

He had originally thought of entering the Death Realm directly.

But now, it seemed there was a better choice!

Su Yu laughed, "So, if I merge the Abyssal Realm with the Death Realm, sealing the exit of the Abyssal Realm and hiding it, then the Death Realm would be entirely mine?"

"Not necessarily!"

The Fate Emperor added, "The regular passageways would be gone, but if there's enough death energy, a passageway can still be opened. Emperor Yu knows this."

Su Yu nodded, smiling, "That's true! But even so... if a passageway is opened, it might not be safe to leave!"

Overall, it seemed quite promising!

The thirty-six ancient cities are actually quite large.

Each city can accommodate hundreds of thousands of people.

So, if he really wanted to take people with him, he could take millions.

And the Abyssal Realm also has giant cities, though many places were destroyed by the Great Zhou King and others, now lying in ruins. Moving the ancient cities in would save the time of rebuilding the ruins!

This was something Su Yu hadn't considered before, but the Fate Emperor's suggestion moved him.

It made sense!

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Even if that bastard Hundred Battle returns, he won't make a big fuss. If he makes too much noise, the Upper Realm will trouble him! So, if he returns, he'll be cautious, quiet, and won't do anything too ostentatious!"

Su Yu stroked his chin, quickly saying, "Alright, I know what to do. I'll go back and prepare, see how I can merge the Abyssal Realm with the Death Realm!"

The Fate Emperor hurriedly said, "If Emperor Yu needs help, I can lend a hand."

"Forget it, you should keep a low profile!"

Su Yu laughed, "At this time, it's best not to get involved with me!"

With that, Su Yu flew out of the realm.

With the White Dog and Marquis Tongtian, Su Yu considered for a moment, then suddenly changed direction, flying towards the Immortal Realm.

...

Immortal Realm.

There hadn't been much change for months. Now, the myriad races were at peace, though other realms were still in turmoil.

With Fat Ball, Su Yu wasn't afraid of anything.

Moments later, he reached the Immortal Realm and suddenly punched the sky!

Boom!

The Immortal Realm trembled slightly, and Su Yu's aura spread.

The next moment, a thin membrane in the Immortal Realm projected the shadow of the Symbol King, filled with anger and vigilance. Seeing Su Yu, his expression changed, and he coldly said, "Su Yu, what do you want?"

Is he going to start a war?

Su Yu, however, smiled, "I don't want anything! Tiangu, come out and chat!"

Silence.

"Come out, don't play dead!"

Su Yu shouted, "I just took down the Phoenix Emperor and the others, don't force me to take down your Immortal Clan now!"

"......"

The Symbol King was shaken. Moments later, a shadow appeared. Tiangu's expression was calm, seemingly more peaceful than before. The shadow looked at Su Yu, with a calm demeanor, "Are you initiating the final battle?"

Su Yu laughed, "Not interested! To be honest, I haven't been bothering you lately, not because I'm idle, but because I went to the Upper Realm and played with Dao Heavenly Sovereign and the others!"

Tiangu remained calm, "You've been quiet for some time, so I suspected you might have gone to the Upper Realm!"

Su Yu laughed, "Wise! Impressive! Tiangu, you're truly a genius. You've probably crossed into the Heavenly King Realm by now, right? Never mind, I don't care! Hand over all the council tokens, and I won't attack you. Otherwise... I'll attack your Immortal Realm now!"

Tiangu frowned slightly, "Su Yu, you seem... unconcerned about mutual destruction. Even if you can suppress me, if my clan perishes, the Upper Realm will open!"

Su Yu laughed, "Who cares! The lower realm is just for fun. Even if the Upper Realm opens now, it doesn't matter! Let me put it this way, over a dozen Heavenly Sovereigns from the myriad races are currently fighting the Control King's lineage... damn, they're strong, even have rulers of laws, fighting fiercely! Do you believe me if I say this?"

"Even if the Upper Realm opens, do you think Dao Heavenly Sovereign and the others have time to bother with you? Believe it or not, even if I kill ten Eternals now, the Upper Realm probably wouldn't care. They're fighting to the death over there, with many Heavenly Kings already fallen. If you could sense it, you should have felt something. Not long ago, I even killed some Heavenly Kings of the Immortal Clan, though they were pseudo-dao experts... you might not have sensed it!"

Tiangu was silent for a moment before speaking slowly, "Some of what you say is believable, some not. The lineage of the Control King... perhaps it's true, related to the past Moon Luo and Ziyan, isn't it?"

"Smart!" Su Yu chuckled. "That's right! So, do you think I dare to attack the Immortal Clan now?"

Tiangu exhaled lightly, "You dare, but since you haven't attacked directly... you must have some concerns, right?"

Su Yu laughed and nodded, "Of course, unless absolutely necessary, there's no need to attack you! Let the dogs of the Upper Realm fight among themselves! There are plenty of dogs up there! A bunch of Heavenly Sovereigns, fighting until their brains spill out! I don't need to open the realm passage now and invite those old things from the Upper Realm down to trouble me!"

Tiangu was silent for a while before asking, "What do you want the council token for? To seal the Upper Realm passage?"

"Not at all!" Su Yu laughed. "Let them open it as scheduled. I want to seal the passage to the Death Realm. In the future, if you want to visit the Death Realm, you can come find me! Tiangu, don't die too quickly. I promised Doubao and Little Furball that I'd feed you to them eventually! If you die too fast, I'll be very disappointed!"

Tiangu's eyes flickered, "You... seem to be preparing to turn the Death Realm into your fallback position. Su Yu, are you afraid?"

Su Yu laughed, "Just in case! There's no choice, there are too many powerful dogs in the Upper Realm. In these days, I've killed over 50 Daofuse experts up there! But... damn it, the more I kill, the more there are!"

Su Yu sighed, "I had no choice but to come back! I can't kill them all. You dogs have been fighting for a hundred thousand years, just playing around! Hardly anyone's been killed, what's the point?"

Su Yu laughed again, "Alright, enough chit-chat! The council token, just say if you're giving it or not! Fat Ball, give him a kick to see how it feels!"

In the next moment, a giant boot appeared, and a powerful aura shook the heavens and earth!

In the distant Divine and Devil Realms, it seemed someone was also spying. Su Yu wasn't polite, shouting, "Hand over the council tokens, stop wasting time. Those who should have heard, have heard. If you don't hand them over, it's war!"

At this moment, Tiangu sighed, "You're as domineering as ever. You don't even bother to hide anything. Fat Ball seems to be heavily injured..."

Su Yu nodded, "Just got beaten up in the Upper Realm! Not lying to you, just now up there, I took down a Heavenly Sovereign, four Heavenly Kings, and 30 Daofuse experts! Killing Daofuse is like killing grandsons... The problem is, there are too many, I can't fight anymore, so I had to flee!"

Su Yu laughed, "If you get a chance, you can ask your Heavenly Sovereign if your Emperor Yu grandpa is fierce or not! I can't beat the Upper Realm, I'm full of anger, don't force me to vent it on you!"

Tiangu chuckled lightly, "Fine, since you put it that way, my clan doesn't want to be your punching bag... The council token can be given to you, but..."

"No buts!" Su Yu said coldly, "But my ass! If I want it, you have to give it! If you don't, I'll take it myself! Even if I suffer heavy losses, I can still easily conquer the Lower Realm!"

At this moment, an ancient city appeared!

Hongmeng had arrived!

With Fat Ball and Marquis Tongtian, their combat power wasn't weak.

Hongmeng's aura was strong, carrying some doubt, but he didn't speak.

Su Yu had returned too quickly, and wasn't he afraid of the Immortal, Devil, and God Realms rebelling at this moment?

And Tiangu seemed to sense Hongmeng's aura, sighing, "Congratulations, Daoist Hongmeng!"

"Congratulations to you too!" Hongmeng smiled, not saying much.

Tiangu looked at the few people, then at Su Yu, who was exuding a murderous aura. After a long time, he reached out and grabbed, and seven council tokens flew out from the Immortal Realm, carrying some sentiment, "Perhaps... next time we meet, I would be willing to spar with Emperor Yu!"

Su Yu laughed, "Next time then! Even if you reach Heavenly King now, and soon Heavenly Sovereign, next time we meet, I'll still beat you up!"

He grabbed the seven council tokens with one hand, smiling.

His gaze turned to the other two realms, "Do I need to come personally to get the tokens from the God and Devil Realms, or will you hand them over yourselves?"

Even after being defeated in the Upper Realm, even with his Great Dao broken.

At this moment, facing the three realms, Su Yu was still domineering!

Somewhat reckless!

Yes, reckless!

I'm not afraid of anything, you open the Upper Realm, open it well!

At worst, I'll take my people and flee instantly, to the Death Realm!

Leave the mess in the Lower Realm for others to clean up!

I don't care about your lives!

At this moment, Su Yu seemed to have shed his shackles, reckless and relaxed, as if he had returned to the past, so arrogant and flamboyant!

Just like back in the ancient city, I wasn't afraid of you, what could you do to me?

Today, Tiangu and the others felt something.

If they didn't comply, there was a ninety percent chance Su Yu would really attack the three great realms!

The God and Devil Realms didn't say much. Soon, in the sky above the realms, blood-colored council tokens floated out, six from the God Realm, five from the Devil Realm, providing Su Yu with a total of 18 council tokens from the three realms.

And before this, Su Yu himself had 38 tokens.

By this point, Su Yu controlled a total of 56 council tokens.

Su Yu didn't stop, quickly flying with his people to the sky above the Ancient Giant Race, his voice cold, "Hand over the council tokens!"

Below, the voice of the Ancient Giant King came, "Last time, I at least helped the Human Clan once..."

"Stop the nonsense, you helped Hundred Battle, not me!" Su Yu said coldly, "Besides, I repaid the favor! Otherwise, do you think your clan could still be so at ease? Don't force me to break your realm and expose everything! You know your own situation!"

Below, there was silence for a moment, then a council token flew out.

Su Yu's face turned cold, "Four tokens, make it an even 60! If you can't produce four, I'll break your realm now. No matter how confident you are, without Hundred Battle, you won't dare to move! Hurry up, if you dawdle, don't blame me for being rude!"

In the realm, the Ancient Giant King's face changed repeatedly.

With some anger, he said in a low voice, "I don't understand Emperor Yu's intentions..."

"Kill!" A violent shout, Su Yu punched out, and White Dog stomped down with a boot!

Old Turtle's Grand Dream City directly suppressed!

At this moment, four council tokens floated out!

Su Yu snorted, then stopped, "Stubborn fool! You don't know what's good for you! Tell Hundred Battle, he owes me, Yunshui and the others owe me! If they don't repay me... just wait and see!"

Su Yu sneered, "Also, everything I left behind is mine. If I give it, he can take it. If I don't... if he takes it by force, then just wait and see!"

In the realm, the Ancient Giant King remained silent.

In his heart, however, waves were surging!

Su Yu, what do you mean?

"Let's go!" Su Yu ordered, and the group retreated. Su Yu laughed heartily, his laughter shaking the heavens and earth.

"Even if I lose, I can still be domineering, so what? Being a grandson for a few days is fine, but for six thousand years, be careful you really become a grandson!"

The voice echoed throughout the myriad realms, some understood, some didn't.

So what?
