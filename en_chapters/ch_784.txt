Chapter 784: Universal Revival (Request for Subscription)

Within the Death Path.

Taking advantage of the Lord of the Dead's disappearance, Su Yu swiftly began reviving everyone, with thunder rumbling all around!

The power of life and death was being massively extracted by Su Yu, causing the entire intersection of life and death to tremble.

The second to be revived was the South King!

The revival of the South King brought forth an unbelievably powerful thunder tribulation. The force of the lightning was so intense that it felt as if Su Yu's entire world was about to be shattered!

The South King endured!

From a charred state, she recovered.

The revived South King, like Marquis Lanshan, had changed her attire. No longer in her previous undead form, her face remained as cold as before, perhaps even more so, exuding an even more indifferent aura.

Her aura was turbulent, and her attire was simple—a plain long black silk dress without excessive adornments.

The South King didn't seem to be of the Human Race.

But what race she belonged to, Su Yu didn't know before, and the South King had never mentioned it.

Now, Su Yu had a vague sense.

The South King was indeed not of the Human Race, nor of the God, Demon, or Immortal races. After a brief perception, Su Yu speculated that the South King might be from an ancient humanoid race that had long been extinct.

Either a Soul Race or the long-vanished Celestial Race from the ancient and primordial eras, which had once dominated the world but had since disappeared into the dust of history. No wonder the South King never mentioned her race; it wasn't forgotten, just gone.

The South King also chose a path, directly extending upwards. Almost instantly, she gave the impression of being a Heavenly Sovereign!

It seemed she had mastered this path in her previous life and had reached the Heavenly Sovereign domain.

The South King had been a Heavenly King long ago!

She might have been a Heavenly King, or even a Heavenly Sovereign, before her death. Or perhaps... there were no Heavenly Sovereigns in that era, and she was a master of the rules. Of course, Su Yu had never heard of a master of the rules being revived, so the specifics might only be known to the South King herself.

At this moment, the South King merged with a path not chosen by Su Yu but by herself.

It was a rather rare path of power, the Whip Path.

Did the South King have such a preference?

Did she use a whip?

That couldn't be right!

In previous battles, the South King hadn't used a whip.

Well, Su Yu didn't have time to dwell on it.

At this moment, he was reviving the next person, not daring to delay too long. Prolonged delay might allow the Lord of the Dead to revive again, and he didn't have a second Dragonblood Marquis to use.

The third was finally Hetu.

This made Hetu excited; it was finally his turn.

However, this time, Hetu's revival was more challenging than the others. It wasn't that his revival was difficult or that there wasn't enough vitality, but the power of the thunder was unexpectedly strong. Although Marquis Lanshan and the South King had resisted it seemingly effortlessly, the thunder attacking Hetu was also formidable. Even after merging with the source, Hetu only possessed second-tier Daofuse power.

Yet, the thunder's power seemed to reach the level of a Heavenly King.

Previously, the thunder for Marquis Lanshan and the South King was also strong, but perhaps there was a boundary, not exceeding the Heavenly Sovereign level, so both managed to withstand it.

As for Hetu, his revival was quicker, with his physical body intact, and Su Yu didn't consume much life force.

However, the thunder almost struck him dead!

Hetu ultimately endured.

But he was left battered and bruised, unlike the South King and others who recovered gracefully.

Even after recovery, Hetu remained charred all over, and it would take some time to rid himself of it.

Su Yu shouted loudly, "Those who wish to be revived, consider carefully! This thunder is beyond my control; it's the final test before true revival. The thunder grants some special vitality for revival. If we help you resist it, we can, but... then you might face insufficient vitality, unable to revive, and be stripped from the Death Path's source... In that case, it would be a dead end!"

His keen eyes discerned that the thunder actually granted the undead some special vitality for revival. Blocking it might directly lead to revival failure, so it was best to face it themselves.

Those undead who had merged with the source didn't say they would withdraw.

At this point, seeing hope, withdrawing would be truly foolish.

Even if it meant death, they would try once.

A total of about 30 undead had merged with the source. Those who hadn't merged had no chance now, and Su Yu couldn't allow anyone else to merge. Further merging would surely cause the Lord of the Dead to reappear.

Previously, Dragonblood Marquis had barely filled this gap. Now, unless an Undead Emperor was used to fill it, no one could patch this gap!

...

Revival, continuous revival.

Su Yu extracted life force from his own path and from the depths of the Death Path. The revival of these powerful beings consumed a lot.

By the time he revived the Fire God Clan member, Su Yu had almost drained all the life force from his path, even drawing heavily from the source!

That Skyfire was quite powerful, consuming so much that Su Yu nearly failed in the revival.

Skyfire clearly sensed it too. After revival, he obediently merged into the Fire Path without saying anything.

Su Yu had only one Fire Path.

Originally, it should have been Marquis Huoyun or a strong Fire Spirit Clan member to merge, but Marquis Huoyun was a Heavenly King and hadn't merged into the path. The Fire Spirit Clan's choice surprised Su Yu because the Five Elemental Race members all chose to merge into the unified Five Elemental Path.

Just like Topsoil Spirit's choice!

According to them, their race had little hope of becoming a master of the rules, but by merging into a single path, they could strengthen it, allowing Topsoil Spirit to be the first to step into that domain!

Like the Human Race's Body Path, when Topsoil Spirit strengthens the Five Elemental Path, even if they can't become a master of the rules, they can be like the ancient Body Path Human King. Clearly, the Five Elemental Race wanted to merge the Five Elemental Path into the River of Time's Body Path.

This was indeed a path!

One had to admit, such a decision was wise. They might not have the insights of a master of the rules, but by collectively strengthening a path, they could progress faster than others.

The Five Elemental Race all merged into the Five Elemental Path, making the Five Elemental Path in Su Yu's world stronger than other paths. Topsoil Spirit was likely to become a pseudo-path Heavenly King soon.

Out of 32 undead strong beings, 6 were struck dead by the thunder.

Su Yu had tried letting others block it, but after a while, the undead themselves collapsed. The thunder striking them actually provided a chance for revival.

Once the thunder was gone and they weren't fully revived, it led to collapse instead.

The death of 6 undead didn't concern Su Yu much.

Among them, three were unfamiliar to him, clearly undead from other places. The remaining three included two Daofuse under the South King and one who had joined later from the Celestial River of Death.

Su Yu wasn't very familiar with them.

He wasn't hypocritical; if he wasn't familiar, death was just death.

Unable to withstand the thunder's power, there was nothing Su Yu could do.

...

After reviving these undead.

Quickly, Su Yu looked at Xingyue, who was still merging with the source.

At this moment, Xingyue's aura finally showed a breakthrough.

She quickly stepped into Daofuse!

Almost in the blink of an eye, she advanced from fourth-tier Daofuse to third-tier, then second-tier, and soon reached the aura of a Heavenly King, and then vaguely reached the aura of a Heavenly Sovereign.

After reaching the Heavenly Sovereign level, Su Yu actually sensed that Xingyue hadn't reached her limit. She could still improve, but the rules of the Myriad Realms were still in effect.

Xingyue might have been a master of the rules in her previous life!

But having died once, upon revival, she was still affected by the seal set by the Human Emperor, restricted.

Otherwise, Xingyue might have already reached the realm of a master of the rules.

Although she was only a Heavenly Sovereign, Xingyue's aura didn't rise much. At this time, her black and white, life and death forces rotated, and Su Yu observed for a while, understanding how she could be revived!

Moments later, two paths extended from the Ink Path.

One of life, one of death, intertwined.

Su Yu looked at Xingyue, and Xingyue also opened her eyes to look at Su Yu, her gaze somewhat complex. She suddenly spoke, "Are you sure you want to revive me?"

At this moment, within the Death Path, only Su Yu and Xingyue remained.

Su Yu smiled, "At this point, of course, I want to revive you!"

Xingyue looked at him, and after a long time, she said, "In the Death Realm, I've maintained the nature of an undead for over a hundred thousand years. I've always been an undead, not a living being! I had no sorrow, no joy, only calmness."

She had always been in this state, and due to her strength, she hadn't restored any of her true nature before.

The nature of the undead was coldness, slaughter, and anger.

Only these!

Upon reaching Daofuse, most undead would stabilize their true nature, restoring their true self, which was also related to the restoration of memories, and Xingyue's memory restoration was minimal.

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Xingyue continued, "It was you who made me feel alive, angry. You were always bullying me..."

Su Yu chuckled, "You're joking, my lady. I'm not that kind of person. How could I bully you?"

Xingyue ignored him and continued, "So, at this moment, I actually want to be revived. I want to be human again, to experience different feelings, different sensations..."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "That's how it should be!"

"Su Yu!"

Xingyue looked at Su Yu, her voice muffled, "So, after I revive, you'll be a stranger to me, right?"

Su Yu thought for a moment and nodded, "That's fine!"

Xingyue looked at him, seeing Su Yu's calm demeanor, and finally nodded, "Then... let me be revived!"

Su Yu said no more, and the two paths of life and death extended towards Xingyue.

One path extended to the gap in the River of Time, the other connecting to the Death Path.

Su Yu took out a pill and tossed it to Xingyue. "This is a Longevity Pill. Take it. You might have been a master of the power of laws in your previous life, but you're now in a state of half-life and half-death. Even though you've regained the strength of a Heavenly Sovereign, you might still age and die after recovery."

Xingyue wasn't entirely sure of the pill's effects, but she quickly consumed it.

"Devour the power of the Great Dao of Life and Death!" Su Yu instructed. "After devouring it, you'll still be in a state of half-life and half-death... the balance of life and death remains unbroken."

With that, the Heaven Gate appeared, and Su Yu looked at Xingyue. "After you devour the Great Dao of Life and Death, use the power of death to attack my Heaven Gate, converting death energy into life energy."

Xingyue looked at him. "Attack you?"

"Yes!"

Xingyue remained silent.

Su Yu frowned. "This is the only way to resurrect you. Your current strength even slightly surpasses mine. Even after taking the Longevity Pill, the life energy I can provide isn't enough for your resurrection!"

Not giving Xingyue a chance to speak, Su Yu continued sternly, "Also, after your resurrection, quickly enter the River of Time and grasp the power of the Great Dao you once mastered. This world no longer supports newcomers becoming masters of the power of laws. At best, you can maintain the status of a Heavenly Sovereign!"

Xingyue nodded slightly.

"Enough talk. Once your memories recover, these words might dissipate with the impact. Let's begin!"

Xingyue remained silent and began to devour the Great Dao of Life and Death. Her aura grew stronger, yet she couldn't break through that boundary.

Su Yu wasn't too concerned. It might be useless now, but once the seal is broken and the master of the power of laws is no longer a restriction, Xingyue will quickly advance further on the path of the master of the power of laws. The benefits will come eventually.

As the power of life and death was devoured, Xingyue's aura quickly surpassed Su Yu's!

Boom!

At this moment, the Death Path trembled again, and the Time Path at the connection point also shook.

Two forces clashed!

Su Yu observed silently. It wasn't enough. He shouted, "Swallow the Longevity Pill!"

Xingyue quickly swallowed the Longevity Pill. Her vitality increased slightly, but the Longevity Pill wasn't an instant-effect pill; it worked over time. The temporary burst of vitality was still insufficient.

Su Yu's Heaven Gate appeared, and he shouted, "Convert life and death, attack with all the power of death!"

Xingyue looked at Su Yu. Su Yu's expression changed, and he shouted, "Hurry! I've paid such a high price, not for you to hesitate. Quickly!"

Xingyue was a bit angry. "You..."

Su Yu was always so domineering!

Feeling frustrated, she quickly converted the power of life and death. A large amount of death energy overflowed, and in the next moment, a powerful force of death struck the Heaven Gate. The Heaven Gate trembled, and a burst of life energy erupted, instantly covering the death energy, transforming it into life energy.

Su Yu frowned and shouted again, "Are you weak? Useless! I said all the power of death, not just a small portion. Hurry up, or do you want the Lord of the Dead to revive again, or for someone in the Time Path to awaken? Is that what you want?"

Xingyue was furious. "Can't you stop ordering me around?"

Su Yu glared. "Shut up. Do as I say!"

Why so much nonsense?

Xingyue was exasperated but had no choice but to comply. She was worried that if she unleashed all her power, Su Yu might be seriously injured.

Fine, it would be better to beat this bastard to death!

In the next moment, a formidable force of death erupted from her body. Xingyue let out a low shout, and all the power of death surged towards the Heaven Gate!

On the Heaven Gate, some consciousness seemed to emerge, belonging to the Heaven Gate itself.

Did the Lord of the Dead want to attack from inside and outside to break the Heaven Gate?

Perhaps that was the Heaven Gate's intention.

In the next moment, an extremely dense force of life reversed the death energy. Xingyue's death energy was quickly transformed into life energy, which was a severe blow to the dead!

But for Xingyue, the rapid reversal of death energy meant that the life energy within her quickly gained the upper hand!

At this moment, from the opening of the River of Time, a force of the Great Dao extended, seemingly welcoming its master. The Great Dao she once controlled seemed to sense her revival!

Su Yu, too, was pushed back several kilometers by the powerful impact of life and death, coughing up blood. He frowned slightly, looking towards the intersection of life and death.

Over there, Xingyue's vitality erupted!

The opening dug by the Lord of the Dead now emitted a special wave of power, the specific Great Dao power of which Su Yu was unsure, but it should be the Great Dao power Xingyue mastered in her previous life.

At this moment, Xingyue's aura fluctuated several times, her black and white energies shifting, with the white energy suppressing the black.

From all directions, forces of the Great Dao, carrying some aggression, surged towards her!

The power of the Celestial River of Death also surged towards her!

It seemed to be trying to stop her resurrection!

However, at this moment, the Starry Sky Seal that Su Yu had given to Xingyue earlier suddenly erupted with a powerful force, suppressing the surrounding forces of the Great Dao.

Su Yu glanced at it and smiled.

It seemed that he didn't need to do anything. The Human Emperor might have arranged everything back then. All that was needed was a different force of life and death to stimulate Xingyue's revival, allowing life energy to overpower death energy.

And over there, Xingyue's memories seemed to be reviving, her face showing signs of pain!

She groaned softly, her aura growing stronger.

Yet, she remained within a boundary.

From the River of Time, a powerful force seemed to be pulling her back, trying to accept her return. Her own Great Dao power was also tugging at her, trying to pull her back from her undead state!

Seeing this, Su Yu shouted, "Go back!"

Xingyue suddenly opened her eyes, looking at Su Yu, her eyes filled with more life than death!

At this moment, from the opening behind her, a strong force of attraction emanated. Xingyue opened her eyes and looked at Su Yu, her gaze different from before, as if memories were constantly reviving. She looked at Su Yu, struggling, life energy spilling over, and said word by word, "My... memories... are being impacted..."

Su Yu nodded.

"I... might... forget you..."

Su Yu smiled. "That's fine!"

Xingyue looked at him, a trace of anger flashing in her eyes. "You... don't have... any regrets?"

Su Yu laughed. "Stop adding drama to yourself. Hurry up, will you?"

Xingyue felt a sense of loss and sighed. "Then I... have to go!"

She looked at Su Yu, her gaze complicated. "If I fully recover... I might have to go upstream!"

Su Yu frowned slightly.

Xingyue's expression was complex. At this moment, the intense impact of memories swept over her again. She knew she couldn't hold on much longer and quickly said, "My... my brother is upstream... in danger! He... seems to be injured! I... I must go... I control the power of healing, proficient in the path of life. Here, I can only maintain the status of a Heavenly Sovereign. If I go upstream, I can return to being a master of the power of laws!"

In Xingyue's memory, the memories related to the undead were once again impacted!

She had no choice but to accelerate, directly transmitting her willpower. "You said I liked planting flowers... teaching the Time Sage to plant flowers... but it wasn't about planting flowers... it was a way of utilizing life energy..."

"Upstream, others might also be injured. My brother hasn't returned, probably because he can't return now... so I must go to heal their injuries and buy more time... I'm not escaping... I just hope to delay longer... Su Yu... you must become stronger... otherwise, when they return... you won't have a chance!"

Su Yu frowned slightly. "You want to participate in the battle of the masters of the power of laws?"

Going upstream!

That's a battle of the masters of the power of laws, not just one or two, but dozens or even hundreds!

He originally thought that Xingyue's revival, even if she didn't remember much, wouldn't matter.

In this Myriad Realms, the danger wasn't great.

But if she went upstream, she could fall at any moment.

Xingyue's sea of will continued to roar, a large amount of memory impacting her. Her tone was urgent, and even her willpower became urgent. "I'm a healer, I must go... to heal them! It's been too many years, their injuries are probably severe..."

Su Yu frowned again. A healer?

He suddenly laughed. "You're a doctor who got yourself killed. Does that make you a quack?"

Xingyue was still thinking about what he would say, but upon hearing this, she couldn't help but get angry. "Did you listen to me? I'm not a quack. My death... was an accident, targeted by some who feared my mastery of the path of life... cough, cough, cough..."

She kept coughing, infuriated.

Su Yu's focus was always different from others!

Xingyue quickly turned to look behind her, hurriedly saying, "I must go now. If I leave now, I can still draw a large amount of life energy. If I delay, I might not be able to leave this place. I must use this newly revived power, suppress the fluctuations with the Starry Sky Seal, and head upstream..."

She was going to join the battle upstream!

Su Yu said nothing more. The Human Emperor... the Human Emperor was probably her brother.

In this Myriad Realms, it's always the brother saving the sister or the sister saving the brother. Indeed, being an only child is better. With many siblings, you always have to go save them. It's really pitiful. But, Su Yu thought, having a sister to save might be nice too.

At this moment, Su Yu also realized what the force from the River of Time was. It was actually the power of life!

The path of life!

This was interesting. The emperor of the Immortal Race seemed to also master a similar type of Great Dao, though it seemed different.

Xingyue said she was targeted back then.

So she was assassinated?

At that time, the Human Emperor might not have even become the Human Emperor, but was just the Human Lord?

Thoughts flickered in Su Yu's mind. He looked at her and quickly said, "So, you're leaving soon?"

"Yes... I... I can't stay. If I miss this opportunity, I won't be able to go upstream again. If they return defeated, it will be a disaster for the Myriad Realms, and for you as well..."

If the Human Emperor and the others were to be defeated and retreat, Su Yu, as a member of the human race, would likely face misfortune too. The logic was sound, yet Su Yu couldn't help but retort, "Don't bring me into this! You're going to save your brother, but from the way you say it, it sounds like you're going upstream to save me. How innocent am I!"

Xingyue felt exhausted. At this moment, countless memories began to resurface, flooding her sea of will. Moments later, Xingyue let out a roar, and boom! A unique aura emerged.

At this moment, the death aura around her almost completely dissipated. When she looked at Su Yu again, her gaze shifted slightly, carrying a hint of unfamiliarity. She hesitated slightly as she glanced at Su Yu.

Su Yu also looked at her and smiled, "Hi, Xingyue!"

Xingyue seemed to recall something, or perhaps she didn't remember at all. She frowned slightly, then suddenly turned to look at the mouth of the River of Time. Holding the Xingyu Imprint, this time, the Xingyu Imprint emitted a different glow. She stepped directly towards the gap without looking back!

The powerful Xingyue, carrying the Xingyu Imprint, crossed into the gap almost effortlessly. She turned back to look at Su Yu, her gaze somewhat cold, her voice changed, carrying a hint of indifference, "I still remember you, Su Yu! But what you owed me, you've repaid this time. Between us, no one owes the other anymore. I once saved you too!"

Su Yu smiled and nodded, "Of course!"

Xingyue gave him a cold look. At this moment, a path of life appeared beneath her feet. Xingyue stepped into the River of Time, across the boundary of life and death, and looked at Su Yu again. Her voice faintly echoed, "You have talent, but compared to some, you may not be stronger. Take care of yourself!"

With those words, her figure vanished from the gap, and a surge of vitality erupted in the River of Time.

Take care of yourself?

Su Yu pouted. Women, truly heartless. Just a moment ago, she seemed reluctant, and in the blink of an eye, she changed completely.

Su Yu chuckled. Let her change!

It's fine!

Since I've revived you this time, I no longer owe you anything.

...

In the River of Time.

A surge of intense vitality erupted. Xingyue seemed on the verge of breaking the seal. She even had hope of breaking the seal and could fight!

But at this moment, she frowned.

Break the seal?

Breaking the seal could make her a ruler of laws, but it might also trigger a chain reaction, allowing all Heavenly Sovereigns to seize the opportunity to advance together!

After hesitating for a moment, she looked back at the gap, now covered by the river. Xingyue suddenly snorted coldly, "Bastard!"

He didn't even say a single good word.

Serves you right to be single for life!

She looked upstream again, a trace of worry in her eyes. Upstream, she could already sense her brother's poor condition. Blood ties allowed her to feel that the distance wasn't too far, but her brother might be seriously injured.

At this moment, the erupting vitality was spreading upstream. She could take this opportunity to go upstream.

She glanced downward, unable to see Su Yu anymore.

Yet, she seemed to see Su Yu's expression, his indifference, his nonchalance.

"Bastard!"

She cursed again. The next moment, she intended to go directly upstream, but suddenly, as if recalling something, she turned her body and forcibly rushed downstream at an incredible speed.

In the blink of an eye, she reached a nearby tributary, which was incredibly powerful.

At this moment, someone seemed to be in the tributary. Suddenly, a person opened their eyes and quickly flew out of the tributary.

Hundred Battle was somewhat shocked. Who was this?

Boom!

Before he could speak, an incomparably powerful force erupted instantly. With a single palm strike, it sent Hundred Battle staggering, almost causing him to fall.

Xingyue reached out, and a figure appeared. The Heavenly Overseer Marquis looked dazed, but the next moment, his mouth opened wide. He was suddenly grabbed by Xingyue, transforming into countless threads that instantly surrounded Hundred Battle.

Xingyue's voice was cold, "You are the fortune of my dynasty, my subject. Suppress him for a moment, or I'll sever your fortune!"

With a clear shout, the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, unable to control himself, was transformed into a large net by her, enveloping Hundred Battle.

Hundred Battle frowned.

He was about to erupt, but suddenly hesitated slightly, choosing not to fight to the death, not to destroy the Heavenly Overseer Marquis, and not to battle this mysterious woman.

At this moment, figures emerged from the tributary below.

Changqing and the others were all somewhat shocked. Who was this?

"Traitors!"

Xingyue snorted coldly, reaching out to grab them. Just as they were about to resist, a suppressive force appeared. The next moment, the Xingyu Imprint appeared, and with a rumble, it suppressed those ancient court ministers!

This was entirely different from when it was in Su Yu's hands!

When Su Yu held the Xingyu Imprint, it didn't have the effect of suppressing these ministers.

But in Xingyue's hands, it did.

Changqing and the others suddenly changed colors, their expressions shifting dramatically. This... this is... one of the rulers of the imperial court!

Who is she?

What does she want to do?

Xingyue didn't do anything else. She reached out to grab those people again. At this moment, everyone knew what she was doing!

At this moment, the bodies of the powerful figures were being drained of a large amount of vitality and physical strength!

In the distance, Hundred Battle's expression changed, and he shouted, "How dare you!"

Boom!

Hundred Battle's aura instantly grew stronger by three points, breaking through the Heavenly Overseer Marquis's blockade. At this moment, Xingyue's aura changed again, grabbing the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and transforming him into a long sword, pointing it at Hundred Battle, "Don't come closer! Do you want me to break the seal now and let all parties advance to become rulers of laws?"

Hundred Battle frowned slightly, "You are of the human race! What do you want? Even if everyone advances, though it may cause changes, it's not unbearable for me!"

Xingyue thought for a moment, perhaps that's true.

She no longer spoke of this, instead pointing at Changqing and the others, "They are my household ministers, traitors to my imperial court! I will extract half of their physical strength and vitality, and the crime of betrayal will be written off! Hundred Battle, you don't want your people to bear the name of traitors forever, do you?"

Hundred Battle's expression changed slightly, "Who can you represent?"

"I represent the Human Emperor!"

Xingyue held the Xingyu Imprint, suppressing those people, and wielded the Heavenly Overseer sword coldly, "I represent the imperial court!"

"Allow me to extract, and the crime of treason, I will pardon them!"

Hundred Battle's expression shifted. He was strong, and if he truly erupted with full force, he wouldn't fear the woman before him. The earlier stumble was simply because he hadn't expected her to strike immediately.

He looked at Changqing and the others, who now had complex expressions.

The crime of treason!

Does it count?

Perhaps... it does!

Xingyue said coldly, "Don't waste my time, hurry up!"

Among the crowd, Blood Shadow and the others sighed, lowering their heads, "Extract it. After the extraction... our relationship with the ancient imperial court will be completely severed!"

Xingyue said calmly, "In the past, you served the imperial court, and now you've betrayed it. I extract your vitality and physical strength, pardoning you on behalf of the imperial court! The Human Emperor has not abandoned you; he is holding back powerful enemies on the front lines for you! This is not the Human Emperor abandoning you; it is you who have betrayed the Human Emperor!"

The Human Emperor has not abandoned them, nor have the other Human Kings. They have always been fighting on the front lines!

Therefore, these people are traitors!

This is not because the emperors do not fight; the emperors are defending against enemies outside, always!

Xingyue no longer explained, quickly extracting a large amount of vitality and physical strength. Soon, she took away the Xingyu Imprint that suppressed them, tossed the Heavenly Overseer Marquis aside, and quickly disappeared from the scene.

Hundred Battle's expression changed slightly, and he asked in a low voice, "May I ask, what is your relationship with the Human Emperor?"

The distant Xingyue did not respond.

She was busy!

No time to deal with Hundred Battle. As for the strong under Hundred Battle, she had extracted half of their vitality and physical strength, but they wouldn't die. Vitality couldn't be restored, but physical strength could be.

Hundred Battle, who controlled the path of physical strength, could eventually restore them.

Xingyue moved quickly, soon leaving Hundred Battle and the others behind.

A portal appeared on her forehead.

She explored around, quickly crossing several great paths, and moments later, arrived at a tributary.

"Is this the path of the Desolate Beast?"

She sensed it, judged it, and it seemed to be.

The next moment, she integrated the large amount of vitality and physical strength she had just extracted into the path of the Desolate Beast, quickly sealing the great path.

After doing this, she looked ahead. There was no time left; she had to leave.

She hurried forward, following the path of vitality, all the way forward, returning to the previous gap. She looked down, and at this moment, the river had already covered that gap.

She thought for a moment. Su Yu, that fool, might not use the path of the Desolate Beast in the short term.

Although she had heard several times that this guy wanted to sever the path of the Desolate Beast to help others restore their physical bodies, he seemed to often forget.

The Xingyu Imprint erupted again, instantly suppressing the river. Xingyue struck the river with a palm, revealing the gap below, faintly seeing Su Yu again.

At this moment, Su Yu seemed busy with something, about to leave the Death Path.

Suddenly, Su Yu looked forward, somewhat puzzled. Why are you back again?

Xingyue looked across the distance, coldly saying, "The path of the Desolate Beast!"

What?

Su Yu was confused, "Speak human language!"

Xingyue was a bit annoyed, snorted, and thought, go to hell!

She quickly sealed the gap, and Xingyue disappeared in an instant.

This time, Su Yu touched his chin, smiled, and suddenly slipped out from the gap, just in time to see Xingyue flying upstream rapidly.

He wasn't unable to slip through; it was just that without the Xingyu Imprint, it was much more difficult to get out.

Watching Xingyue swiftly reverse upstream, Su Yu looked on and shouted, "Remember, brothers are meant to be used, not saved! Don't get yourself killed. If I have time, I'll go play with your brother!"

Xingyue didn't look back, but her steps were somewhat stiff. This guy, it seemed, would never be serious.

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Take care! Just don't hold a grudge! Xingyue, when you reach the upper stream, tell your brother you have a powerful subordinate who will soon shock him to his core, haha!"

"Remember, don't reveal my whereabouts. Otherwise, if we really meet the Human Emperor and I can't see his jaw drop, I'll be very disappointed!"

What a mischievous sense of humor!

Xingyue didn't turn back and quickly left. Su Yu, that rascal, was always so unserious!

As for Su Yu, he waved his hand with a smile, then quickly sighed.

What nonsense, there's no way I can reach there anytime soon!

Just boasting, don't take it seriously!

With that, everyone had fully awakened. As for whether Xingyue retained any memories, Su Yu couldn't be bothered to ask. In truth, he suspected she retained quite a bit. Oh well, he'd check the situation in the Desolate Beast's Great Dao later.

(End of Chapter)
