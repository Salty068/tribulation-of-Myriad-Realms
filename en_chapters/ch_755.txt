Chapter 755: A Fractured Mind (Requesting Subscriptions)

Rescue the old Wan.

Su Yu knew where Old Wan's Great Dao was opened. As long as he could bring him back, he could save him. With that, everyone would be together!

As for those who had left, let them go. Who cared?

Of course, the current group was in a pitiful state, each one floating in the sea of will. If you saw them at night, you might mistake them for ghostly flames. Ghostly flames or not, it didn't matter!

Su Yu gave a final reminder, "Everyone stay here, don't wander off. I'll be back soon! Senior Hongmeng, Wuming, you two keep watch. If that Hundred Battle guy suddenly returns and catches us all in one go... we'd be doomed!"

Everyone shivered.

Marquis Tongtian couldn't help but say, "Good things don't work, bad things do. Emperor Yu, I'll go with you to preserve the fire!"

At this moment, he realized that everyone was actually alive. No wonder Su Yu, despite being beaten to such a state, remained calm and untroubled. Marquis Tongtian now felt that nowhere was safe; the Human Race was too treacherous. It was better to stick with Su Yu.

"You?"

Su Yu was taken aback. Why would you follow me?

But after thinking it over, he smiled, "Alright! I was just thinking that my Great Dao is fractured, which might be a bit troublesome. It's great that you're coming!"

Marquis Tongtian suddenly felt a chill. Did I say something wrong? Should I not have told Su Yu that I wanted to go with him?

"Let's go!"

The Abyssal Realm could also open the River of Time, so it didn't matter. It hadn't sunk into the Death Realm yet, so opening it here was the same. Anyway, they had to move forward, all the way to Old Wan's Human Dao.

...

The River of Time opened, and Su Yu disappeared in an instant.

Once he was gone, a group of ghostly flames floated around.

Among the crowd, there were still living people.

Qi Rong suddenly said, "He's gone. If I leave now, Wuming, Hongmeng, will you stop me?"

The two looked at her.

Hongmeng frowned slightly, "Does Consort Qi wish to leave?"

As he spoke, Hongmeng hesitated for a moment but still said, "Consort Qi, why not wait until he returns? You can talk to him. He probably won't stop you..."

Qi Rong was speechless, "I told him, and he said I owe him a life. I have to repay it before I can leave!"

"......"

This... there's nothing to be done about it.

Hongmeng coughed lightly and said, "Consort... why do you want to leave? Now, others might not accept you either. As the consort of the third generation Human Lord, Hundred Battle might not welcome you. Apart from staying here, it seems you have nowhere else to go."

Consort Qi was silent for a while before speaking, "I don't have to leave, but I want to see if some things I left behind are still there."

"What things?"

Hongmeng smiled, "If Consort Qi doesn't mind, I can do it for you and bring them back."

Consort Qi looked at Hongmeng, and after a long pause, she said, "Old Turtle, back then I asked you to help Yue Gang, but you refused several times, saying it was your ancient duty and you couldn't leave your post! Now, you're eagerly following him. Is Yue Gang not as good as him?"

Hongmeng fell into contemplation, and after a long time, he nodded slightly, "Probably not. Yue Gang... is still lacking."

"Why do you say that?"

Hongmeng smiled, "Yue Gang is not weak in talent. Among the nine generations of Human Lords, no, ten generations, none were weak! But Yue Gang isn't as ruthless as Su Yu, nor as strong as Hundred Battle. He's not decisive enough. In the end, he's still domesticated, not wild!"

Qi Rong frowned.

The Old Turtle sighed, "If it were Su Yu in the third tide, he might have had many choices! When Consort Qi was executed, if it were Su Yu, he might have taken you away, fled, or even defected from the Human Race! If it were Hundred Battle, even if he faked your death like Yue Gang, he would have found a way to kill those old guys, rather than fighting to the death with the myriad races at the last moment..."

The Old Turtle shook his head, "Yue Gang, at every critical moment, is somewhat indecisive! He always misses the best opportunities! Yue Gang likes to plan before acting, but at the slightest disturbance, he stops all plans, lacking the spirit of adventure..."

The Old Turtle evaluated Yue Gang and finally said, "So if Consort Qi is thinking of finding Yue Gang or his undead form to support him in conquering the heavens again, forget it!"

He lamented, "With Hundred Battle and Su Yu around, to put it bluntly, there are many choices. Why choose Yue Gang? Among the ten generations of Human Lords, even if you don't choose these two, choosing the son of the Martial King is better than Yue Gang!"

"So, even if Consort Qi finds Yue Gang's undead form, I advise you to give up those unrealistic ideas! However, Consort Qi, Emperor Yu can use you now. If he can't... Consort Qi, if you keep hesitating, you might soon end up like Shadow Marquis and the others, abandoned by Emperor Yu!"

Consort Qi's somewhat thin face showed a hint of surprise. She looked at him, then at the Fate Emperor and others, and finally sighed, "So, in your eyes, Yue Gang is so worthless?"

"No!"

The Old Turtle shook his head, "All Human Lords are outstanding heroes of their time! They are the elites of an era. In a short time, they all stepped into the Heavenly King realm, even the Heavenly Sovereign realm. This is not something those ancient marquises can compare to! Those who can stand out and become the Human Lord, how can they be worthless? However, precisely because they are all geniuses, there are differences, and there are even more monstrous existences that overshadow their brilliance!"

All Human Lords are not worthless.

They are all the elite among humans!

Qi Rong was speechless, not speaking for a long time. Finally, she still looked up at him, "Let me go out once. I will come back. I really need to retrieve some things."

Hongmeng frowned.

You didn't say this when Su Yu was here, and now that he's not, you say this. How am I supposed to decide?

If I let you go and you betray us or bring people to attack... there are a lot of strong ones here who haven't recovered yet. If they all get captured, Su Yu might really cry and say it's over, and it would really be over!

"What does Consort Qi want to retrieve?"

Consort Qi was silent for a while, feeling a bit exhausted, but still spoke, "Some pseudo-daos."

"Hmm?"

Hongmeng frowned, what does that mean?

Consort Qi said solemnly, "Some pseudo-daos I collected back then. I want to retrieve them to prevent them from being lost. Whether they are still there is uncertain. If they are, they can be used to create some pseudo-dao experts. These pseudo-daos have been nurtured by me and are quite powerful."

These are not comparable to the pseudo-daos Su Yu collected. Su Yu's are in their initial state and haven't been nurtured postnatally, so they are not strong. The Great Dao also needs people to nurture it.

But Hongmeng really couldn't decide.

If Su Yu were here, he would trust Wan Tiansheng a lot. If Wan Tiansheng were here, he could make some decisions. The key is, Wan Tiansheng isn't here either.

Hongmeng's eyes turned, and suddenly, he looked at Fat Ball. Fat Ball was pressing Doubao, a light ball, under its paw, ready to take a bite. Hearing this, it looked up, its dog eyes filled with confusion, and after a while, it said, "What?"

"Consort Qi wants to go out to get something. What do you think, Fat Ball?"

"......"

Fat Ball was dumbfounded. I don't know.

Why are you asking me?

Alright, even though I don't know the situation, Fat Ball thought for a moment and still said, "Okay, then I'll go with her!"

"......"

Consort Qi glanced at Fat Ball, then at Hongmeng, cursing inwardly!

A bunch of bastards!

Hongmeng laughed, gave some instructions through voice transmission, and soon, Fat Ball, wagging its not fully grown tail, left with Consort Qi.

After they left, Wuming chuckled, "Is Consort Qi leaving some backup? Saying she's retrieving pseudo-daos, I think it's more likely she's looking for her own Great Dao, or perhaps... King Gong's Dao?"

Su Yu mentioned that Consort Qi is now practicing petrification.

And King Gong's true Dao is this path.

Of course, King Gong's Return to Origin Blade is also exceptional. It's unknown if Consort Qi has any arrangements.

Hongmeng didn't care much, but said softly, "I wonder if Director Wan can return... If not, the enmity will be great!"

As for who the enmity was with, Hundred Battle and the Chaos Race had plenty of grudges!

The others remained silent, turning into halos, wandering around.

Their true bodies hadn't recovered, so they were too lazy to say anything.

...

At the same time.

Su Yu, with Marquis Tongtian, quickly moved deeper into the River of Time.

Marquis Tongtian was chattering, somewhat unwilling, but Su Yu ignored him.

They walked for a long time until they reached the pen dao area. Su Yu glanced at the pen dao. The part he had previously fused had now exploded, and 80% of the pen dao area was in chaos.

Su Yu could actually fuse the dao again, provided he could sort out this chaotic power of laws!

It would take some time, but with the Starry Sky Seal, he could stabilize the Great Dao first, then sort it out. It wasn't too difficult.

After all, he had fused it once before, and the understanding of the Great Dao was there.

"Maybe in half a month, I can sort it out and become a strong person with quasi-king combat power again!"

Fusing 80% actually just made him Eternal, but the pen dao was still very strong. Su Yu wasn't a true quasi-king. Generally, quasi-kings fused over 95%, or even 99%.

He fused just over 80% and had quasi-king combat power, showing that the pen dao was indeed powerful.

At 90%, he would definitely have Heavenly Sovereign combat power.

Over 95%, he might have combat power like Hundred Battle, comparable to a weak master of laws.

Su Yu had many paths, but he was unwilling to take them.

"Pen dao..."

Su Yu smiled. He could still control this path, and the Mark of Civilization was missing a pen!

Without looking further, Su Yu continued forward.

After walking for a while, he finally saw the path Old Wan had opened.

The Heaven Gate opened, and looking at it, Old Wan's Great Dao was like a living person. Other paths were tributaries, but Old Wan's path was like a gourd hanging on a vine.

Su Yu quickly arrived and looked at the tributary of the Great Dao, a smile appearing on his face. He turned to the panting Marquis Tongtian and said, "Your time has come, old Tongtian. Come, lie down and let me step on you to enter the Great Dao of Director Wan..."

Yes, as a bridge!

After all, Director Wan's Great Dao wasn't his own, and Su Yu wasn't very familiar with the Human Dao. He might not be able to cross it on his own. With Marquis Tongtian here, he could serve as a stepping stone.

Marquis Tongtian's face turned unsightly. "Does Emperor Yu intend to step on my face to cross?"

This was too much!

Su Yu cleared his throat. "You could turn your backside up..."

"Then how would I be any different from the Martial Emperor?"

Marquis Tongtian was furious. "No way, this is humiliating!"

"......"

Su Yu was speechless. Was it really that embarrassing?

Not bothering to argue, Su Yu took out the Mark of Civilization, considering using it to bridge the gap. Just as he was about to do so, Marquis Tongtian suddenly exclaimed in anger, "Why isn't Emperor Yu saying anything?"

"Aren't you going to name a price?"

"......"

Su Yu was taken aback.

He turned to look at Marquis Tongtian, who seemed even more surprised. "Why isn't Emperor Yu naming a price?"

"......"

What price?

Marquis Tongtian felt exhausted. "Emperor Yu, I've been diligently opening doors for you. Even if there's no merit, there's hard work! Now, if you want to step on me to cross, if you offer me a kingship... I might consider it!"

Don't you understand?

I'm currently a marquis. If you promise me a kingship, I'll agree to let you step over me! But you just said one sentence and then decided to do it yourself without any negotiation. I feel shortchanged.

Marquis Tongtian earnestly said, "The Luminous Domain Mansion will surely need a facade in the future, so I was thinking, why not promise me the title of King Tongtian? That way, I'll have the motivation to do anything!"

Su Yu chuckled. "What do you need a kingship for? You're the only one of your race. Does it matter if you're a marquis or a king?"

"Of course!"

Marquis Tongtian was speechless. "Emperor Yu, look at me now. I'm a marquis, and I was conferred by the Culture King! So, my status is quite high. Do you see me giving face to Marquis Dingjun and the others? Do I respect them? Their status isn't as high as mine! Years later, if the Luminous Domain Mansion is also destroyed, as an immortal existence, maybe there will be another era after the ancient times... By then, I'll be King Tongtian! When future generations see me, I won't need to give them face. I'll be a king from the New Yu Era..."

Jinx!

"At that time, I can say I'm a king conferred by the Emperor of the Myriad Races in the New Yu Era, and you are all inferior beings... Doesn't Emperor Yu think that sounds more prestigious?"

He was delighted. "Just like now, if I say I'm a king conferred by the Human Emperor, wouldn't that sound more prestigious?"

Su Yu thought about it and nodded. It made sense!

If you were a king, indeed, your status would be higher.

The key is... you're already considering the demise of my New Yu Era. Isn't that thinking too far ahead?

As Su Yu pondered these thoughts, Marquis Tongtian suddenly sighed. "Actually, I want to be like the Heaven Gate and the Gate of Hell, each sealing an era! Becoming the symbol of that era!"

Su Yu was stunned for a moment, suddenly feeling a splitting headache!

His hair stood on end!

What nonsense?

He abruptly looked at Marquis Tongtian, whose expression also changed. Suddenly transforming into a gateway, he lay down on the tributary, hurriedly saying, "Emperor Yu, quickly cross..."

Su Yu's face turned ashen as he looked at him, speaking in a low voice, "What nonsense did you just say? Repeat it!"

"Nothing..."

"Tongtian!"

Su Yu coldly said, "I heard it!"

"No, Emperor Yu heard wrong!"

He hurriedly said, "Really heard wrong!"

Su Yu's scalp tingled as he looked at him, gritting his teeth. "The Gate of Hell... the Heaven Gate... the Gate of Hell exists, and the Heaven Gate is cultivated by humans. But you said the Heaven Gate sealed an era. What do you mean?"

"Nothing, Emperor Yu heard wrong!"

Marquis Tongtian was almost wailing in grievance. "Really, it means nothing!"

Su Yu's expression changed repeatedly, gritting his teeth. "If the Gate of Hell and the Heaven Gate truly exist! The Gate of Hell sealed the Chaos Era! Then the Heaven Gate, if it exists, I ask you, what era did it seal?"

Su Yu took a deep breath. "If, after the Gate of Hell, it's a reflection of the Chaos Era, then there was the Era of Opening the Heavens, the Primordial Era, the Ancient Era... The Ancient Era hasn't ended! The Primordial Era hasn't been sealed but still has traces, like the Ancient Giant Race and the Martial Emperor, all belonging to the Primordial Era. Only the Era of Opening the Heavens seems almost non-existent..."

"The master of the Time Great Dao sealed the Chaos Era. Who ended the Era of Opening the Heavens? Where is the master of the River of Time? Where is the master of the Death Path?"

Su Yu kept inhaling. "Legend has it that the Human Ancestor ended the Era of Opening the Heavens. Then where is the Human Ancestor? Why is there no legend left from the Era of Opening the Heavens? Only a few traces remain... When did the Heaven Gate appear?"

Marquis Tongtian's one sentence led Su Yu to instantly connect countless dots!

And Marquis Tongtian, at this moment, felt like dying, lamenting, "No, really no, it's a misunderstanding, Emperor Yu heard wrong!"

"You said you wanted to become the third gate sealing an era, becoming a symbol and reflection of an era!"

Su Yu coldly said, "I heard it! I'm thinking, years later, can someone open the Tongtian Gate? Just like I opened the Heaven Gate, and the Chaos Race seems to be opening the Gate of Hell! The gates we open, what exactly are they? Just simple gates?"

"......"

Marquis Tongtian was about to go mad, hurriedly saying, "Emperor Yu, we can't talk about this anymore!"

"Hmph!"

Su Yu snorted coldly. "Legend has it that when the Heaven Gate appears, sages emerge, great men emerge! What exactly is this Heaven Gate? Is it the Heaven Gate we outline, or something else? The Gate of Hell connects to chaos, so where is the Heaven Gate? What does it connect to?"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. "No, where exactly are the Culture King and the others?"

Su Yu suddenly thought of something!

He was shocked. "The Human Emperor is in the River of Time, that I know. Behind the Gate of Hell are Chaos Beasts, that I suspect. I previously thought, could the Culture King and the others be behind that gate?"

"After all, the Myriad Realms is only so big!"

"But you mentioned the Heaven Gate... The Culture King, Martial King, and Time Sage must have all opened the Heaven Gate. Opening the Heaven Gate... What exactly were they pursuing, searching for, encountering what enemies? The Heaven Gate... Could they be pursuing the Era of Opening the Heavens behind the Heaven Gate?"

"......"

Marquis Tongtian was nearly collapsing. It was just a sentence.

I just spoke on a whim!

And this generation's Human Emperor is crazy, instantly connecting countless things. Is he a madman?

How is his brain wired?

Marquis Tongtian lamented, "Stop guessing, if you keep guessing... I'll be in big trouble, huge trouble!"

Su Yu coldly asked, "Why?"

Why would you be in trouble?

Marquis Tongtian was collapsing. "Emperor Yu, gates... also have races! The Gate Race! My status in the Gate Race isn't high, there are big shots above me! If I speak carelessly, I'm doomed!"

"Unless I can also seal a powerful era, turning this era into the Tongtian Gate, only then would I have the qualifications to stand on equal footing with the big shots... Emperor Yu, don't drag me into this, I can't say anymore!"

Marquis Tongtian lamented, "Really can't say anymore!"

Su Yu took a deep breath, then smiled. "Interesting! If my guess is correct, the Heaven Gate truly exists and indeed sealed an era, the Era of Opening the Heavens! The Gate of Hell sealed the Chaos Era! Then the Primordial Era, Ancient Era, including now, are actually one whole, with unbroken inheritance, at least from the Primordial to now, there are still races existing... So, does that mean your existence, Marquis Tongtian, is actually to seal this era, to end this era, right?"

Marquis Tongtian wanted to cry, pitifully saying, "I need a doorstop!"

No filter on his mouth!

And he encountered a genius like Su Yu, who just spoke on a whim, a sentence, and many people would easily overlook it, but Su Yu instantly deduced countless things!

I'm convinced!

I was wrong!

I'll never speak carelessly again!

Su Yu sneered, "Enough nonsense! I'll ask you one question, just answer yes or no! I ask you, did the Culture King and the others enter the real Heaven Gate, yes or no?"

Marquis Tongtian wanted to cry, remaining silent.

"Fine, not answering is an admission, I understand!"

Su Yu nodded, then asked, "Then did the Control King enter the Gate of Hell?"

He still didn't speak.

Su Yu nodded. "This is hard to judge, maybe he's with the Human Emperor..."

Marquis Tongtian was going crazy. I didn't say anything, why did you come to two conclusions?

What's the logic behind your guesses?

"Gates..."

At this moment, Su Yu's smile was radiant, no longer tense, but rather meaningful. "Unintentionally, I actually know where the Culture King and the others are!"

I didn't say anything!

Marquis Tongtian felt dead inside. I really didn't say anything.

I just said one sentence, didn't even mention the Culture King!

And Su Yu, once again looking down at him, smiled, "You don't speak because you're worried the Heaven Gate will trouble you? Or did the Culture King tell you not to speak? Strange... Are you arranged by the Culture King, or by the Heaven Gate? Or are you an accomplice of the Gate of Hell?"

Marquis Tongtian looked utterly desolate, this time not with his backside up, but with his face on the lying gateway, miserably saying, "The Culture King found me back then, saying he wanted me to become a symbol of an era. He said, at the end of an era, there's always a gate, and within that gate, countless stories, countless legends!"

"He said he and his companions opened a new era, and if this era ends, I could seal this era, turning it into a legend!"

Marquis Tongtian wore a sorrowful expression. "Yet, it hasn't ended. I'm quite disheartened. It seems I won't become the emblem of this era. I thought perhaps Emperor Yu could seal this era, bring it to a close, and usher in a new one... then maybe I could become a gateway to a new age!"

Su Yu exhaled, smiling. "Why are you willing to talk now?"

Marquis Tongtian replied with frustration, "I'm afraid you'll shatter me!"

"At least you have some self-awareness!"

Su Yu chuckled. "Does the end of an era mean everyone dies?"

"Not necessarily!" Marquis Tongtian said dejectedly. "I don't really know what constitutes the end of an era. Maybe something significant happens, or something else... I only know that from the ancient times until now, it hasn't ended!"

Su Yu's smile grew brighter. "This is getting more interesting! This world is truly mysterious! The Heaven Gate... it might really exist. There might actually be a gate. Perhaps I should explore other functions of the Heaven Gate. Right now, it seems to only allow one to observe the Great Dao, which feels less powerful than the Gate of Hell. Look at that one; it can even seal the Culture King's boots."

Marquis Tongtian's old face drooped. Life was becoming unbearable.

I didn't say anything! It's all Su Yu's imagination, nothing to do with me. Oh heavens, strike down this over-imaginative monster!

Su Yu ignored him, stepping on his old face. In reality, the face was just a projection; this guy was merely a gate, without a real face. Yet, at this moment, Marquis Tongtian's old face twisted, as if telling Su Yu, "Look, you're stepping on my face, and I'm not even saying anything. Step away, and don't cause me trouble!"

Su Yu chuckled. "Let's take it slow. Don't worry, if we truly end the ancient era, I'll make you the emblem of the ancient times, becoming the Tongtian Gate! In the next era, people won't open the Heaven Gate or the Gate of Hell anymore; they'll open the Tongtian Gate!"

Marquis Tongtian suddenly found himself daydreaming, while Su Yu squinted and smiled. "Not on the forehead, but on the buttocks. How about that?"

"......"

Marquis Tongtian was speechless for a long time. This... felt very wrong!

Su Yu snorted, ignoring him. The Starry Sky Seal appeared, suppressing the power of laws from the Human Dao that was attacking Su Yu.

As he stepped into the Human Dao, Su Yu seemed to see many things. This path was opened by Wan Tiansheng. It was opened not long ago and was still in use. At this moment, Su Yu saw many things in an instant. He saw Wan Tiansheng reading, teaching, conducting experiments...

Which one was the remnant thought left by Wan Tiansheng?

Su Yu looked around, just about to shout when he suddenly froze. He saw an angry Wan Tiansheng, a sorrowful Wan Tiansheng, a crying Wan Tiansheng, and... Wan Tiansheng doing something inappropriate with a woman!

Su Yu's eyes widened!

What the heck?

Old Wan isn't a virgin!

Pah, Old Wan actually hooked up with a woman. This guy is beyond saving, no wonder he's getting worse!

"Eye-burning!"

Su Yu spat, quickly muttering, "I hope that woman wasn't Blue Sky in disguise? Too terrifying! Gives me the chills!"

Shivering, Su Yu hurriedly turned to look at other versions of Wan Tiansheng.

Soon, he saw a demonic Wan Tiansheng and a benevolent Wan Tiansheng.

What the heck!

Old Wan's Human Dao was actually like this!

"Faces of All Beings?"

The term suddenly popped into Su Yu's mind!

Blue Sky was the Path of All Living Beings, and Old Wan was the Faces of All Beings. As for me... I seem to be similar. If I consider the Mark of Civilization as my avatar, then I am also the Faces of All Beings, the Path of All Living Beings, and the myriad paths are complete.

There are demons and saints!

"Indeed, all paths lead to the same destination!"

After a brief glance at the Human Dao, Su Yu suddenly gained a deeper understanding of the Great Dao.

Humans have many faces: there are evil people, good people, kind people, and bad people...

Humans are born this way; it's just a matter of whether there's more evil or good.

No one is born a saint!

Even Old Wan has evil in his heart. At this moment, Su Yu saw an evil Wan Tiansheng, a fierce and malicious Wan Tiansheng, killing and bullying the weak!

Soon, he saw a benevolent Wan Tiansheng, saving all beings.

Then, he saw a warrior Wan Tiansheng, charging into battle...

What the heck!

The more Su Yu looked, the more speechless he became. Was this imagined, or did it really happen?

Old Wan said his path was his understanding, his experience, his life.

So, Old Wan might have really done these things!

Truly terrifying!

Indeed, you can't judge a book by its cover!

Soon, Su Yu saw a lifeless Wan Tiansheng. This seemed to be an evolution of the Death Dao. Wan Tiansheng hadn't truly comprehended death.

But this time, he truly died!

Su Yu looked at the lifeless Wan Tiansheng, suddenly having an epiphany. This... might be Wan Tiansheng's true self!

He died!

But he left behind his lifeless form, reborn from death!

Su Yu stroked his chin, looking at the dazed lifeless form. Suddenly, he shouted, his voice like a great bell, "Awaken!"

This shout was filled with the rhythm of the Great Dao!

Even though Su Yu had severed his external Dao, this shout was still full of Dao charm.

His Dao had never been severed; only the external Dao was severed. His Dao was within the Mark of Civilization!

The lifeless Wan Tiansheng suddenly opened his eyes!

Filled with death energy!

At this moment, within the Human Dao, an angry Wan Tiansheng suddenly charged at Su Yu!

A sorrowful Wan Tiansheng also looked at Su Yu with resentment, a joyful Wan Tiansheng clapped, and a greedy Wan Tiansheng looked at Su Yu as if he wanted to eat him!

The next moment, the lifeless Wan Tiansheng opened his eyes, and suddenly, all the Wan Tianshengs merged, converging towards him!

Vitality began to flourish!

Gradually, life replaced death.

And the entire Human Dao began to tremble, seemingly extending further. In the passage, gradually, only one Wan Tiansheng remained, no different from the one seen in daily life.

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng's eyes still held some confusion, quickly clearing up. He looked at Su Yu, speaking indifferently, "Leave now!"

Su Yu glanced at him, feeling unfamiliar, then quickly sneered, "Keep pretending! I saw everything! You have the Faces of All Beings, and that's fine, but you also have lust! Principal, your character has collapsed, and there's no saving it!"

Wan Tiansheng's cold face suddenly showed a hint of anger, gritting his teeth. "If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute! Shut up! Even if you say it, who would believe you?"

Wan Tiansheng could no longer hold back. Damn, Su Yu actually entered his Great Dao, peeking into it. That was bad enough, but this bastard... what did he see?

He angrily said, "Do you think everyone is like you, seeing a woman and thinking it's Blue Sky? The heavens created men and women, and they are distinct, meant to be together... Of course, you're quite pitiful!"

Wan Tiansheng grumbled, "Go ahead and be jealous. You've been traumatized by Blue Sky, but don't think of me. I'm not afraid! When I was finding women, Blue Sky wasn't even born. I'm 30 years older than him. Sorry, after 30, I focused on cultivation and stopped playing around!"

"You pitiful guy, I curse you to meet only women who are Blue Sky in disguise!"

"In my time, there was no Blue Sky!"

"......"

Su Yu's face turned green!

Those words... seemed to make sense!

Wan Tiansheng was furious. Ha, little guy, trying to mess with me!

Usually, I can't be bothered with you!

Daring to provoke me?

Come on, who provokes who?

Who's afraid of who?

You, destined to be single!

Soon, Wan Tiansheng flicked his robe, looking suave. "Alright, let's go! Staying here too long isn't good. Once we're out, you don't speak of me, and I won't speak of you. It's all trivial. Let's forget what just happened!"

Su Yu was frustrated, feeling down. Suddenly, the gossip he saw didn't seem appealing anymore!

"Principal, does this mean you're dead?"

Wan Tiansheng saw he wasn't mentioning it anymore, sighed in relief, and smiled. "I suppose so. It's an understanding of the Death Dao, reborn from death! Last time Blue Sky opened the Dao, I noticed the Death Dao was missing. Later, I realized I was the same!"

"You speak of the Faces of All Beings, I speak of the Dao of Emotions. Life and death are emotions, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are all emotions... Without death, the Great Dao is incomplete!"

He looked at Su Yu. "The master of the Death Dao extracted the Death Dao. In truth, the myriad paths are now fragmented, but within the River of Time, I believe the Death Dao is still present!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Forget it, no more gossip about Old Wan. Let's get to the point. He quickly said, "So, Principal, are you now in a state of willpower sea?"

"No."

Wan Tiansheng shook his head, smiling. "I'm now in the state of the Iron Devourer Race. I transform the Great Dao, and the Great Dao becomes me! I've shed my physical body, reborn from death. I was preparing for this, but your plan made me comprehend death a bit earlier... Death is a good way to break free from the shackles of the physical body. Of course, the physical body has its advantages. My current state is somewhat special!"

Su Yu frowned. "Is it good or bad?"

"Hard to judge!"

Wan Tiansheng smiled. "Having a physical body, I think, has more benefits. In my current state, my strength isn't weak, but if I encounter a place that targets the Great Dao, I'll be in trouble! For example, in a place that seals the Great Dao, if you have a physical body, you're still a top expert. But for me, if the Great Dao is sealed, it means I'm sealed, and I'll have no combat power... So, I should find an opportunity to restore my physical body!"

Su Yu nodded. "I noticed the understanding of the Death Dao seems to have brought the Human Dao closer. Does that mean you've reached the Heavenly Sovereign realm?"

"No, I haven't!"

Wan Tiansheng shook his head, smiling. "Previously, I was only at the initial quasi-king realm, a weak Heavenly King at best. Now, I've gained more understanding, slightly stronger, but not as strong as a Heavenly Sovereign, that's for sure! Now, I might not lose to those old Heavenly Kings... but becoming a Heavenly Sovereign isn't that simple!"

Su Yu chuckled, "Not bad at all. It seems that death is also a form of rebirth... This gives me some ideas for reviving certain spirits!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "Among the spirits, I think Hetu is the easiest to revive! He still has a physical body, so we can use him as a test subject. I believe reviving Hetu will be quite simple!"

When Hetu transformed into a spirit, Old Turtle had opened a backdoor for him. After killing him, his body directly turned into a spirit!

Hetu never went to the Celestial River of Death; he went straight to the Death Realm!

Wan Tiansheng laughed, "In my opinion, Hetu's state is more like that of a half-dead person! If Hetu successfully revives, we can gain more experience! Both you, Lantian, and I are walking this path of merging life and death... However, I suggest you open your dao first before reviving! Without opening your dao, your comprehension is still lacking, making revival quite difficult!"

Su Yu pondered for a moment and nodded, "Indeed, perhaps I should open my dao! Previously, I had placed the virtual dao into various great daos for nurturing. If Hundred Battle returns and sees it, it wouldn't be good... Maybe I should retrieve it and prepare to open my dao!"

As Su Yu spoke, he suddenly laughed, "I've thought of a good idea: to steal more power of the daos! Principal, I'll first repair the pen dao, spend some time on it, then merge with it. After merging, I'll extract all the power of the pen dao and infuse it into the Mark of Civilization... This way, the pen dao page will become extremely powerful... Yes, that's the plan!"

Wan Tiansheng also nodded, "Good idea, but I'm worried you might collapse the pen dao, truly collapse it!"

"That's fine. Anyway, the Culture King doesn't want it anymore. I'll give it a try..."

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng stepped out of the Human Realm, stepping onto Marquis Tongtian.

Marquis Tongtian looked at Wan Tiansheng, then at Su Yu, bewildered.

What the hell!

What's going on?

Weren't they supposed to be dead?

How could such a big living person hide within the great dao?

This was beyond belief!

Today, Marquis Tongtian's worldview was shattered.

He had truly seen all sorts of bizarre situations.

It was one thing for Su Yu to be abnormal, but Wan Tiansheng wasn't normal either!

Are there no normal people among the humans?

The next moment, the two of them walked through the air, and Marquis Tongtian hurriedly followed, shouting, "Take me with you, don't go so fast..."

Su Yu ignored him. He wanted to see if he could stabilize the fluctuations of the pen dao, then try merging with it, and finally extract the power of the pen dao and infuse it into his Mark of Civilization. Yes, that's the plan!

...

Moments later, they arrived at the pen dao.

Then, Su Yu used the Starry Sky Seal to suppress it, once again organizing the power of the pen dao, and began merging from the very beginning!

...

At this moment.

In the endless darkness, a man in white, who was fleeing, paused, "Hmm?"

How many years have passed?

It felt like it just happened, my successor's dao was severed.

And now... someone is merging with the dao again?

Is it the previous one, or has a new era begun with new people arriving?

Strange!

He was a bit puzzled. The next moment, his expression changed, "Huh!"

The dao was severed again?

What the hell!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu merged a little, controlled a bit of the power of laws, and then frantically extracted the power of the pen dao, sealing it into the Mark of Civilization.

Soon, a page of the book displayed an arrow!

Su Yu was overjoyed!

It actually worked!

Wow, this means I can completely extract the power of the pen dao!

As for collapsing it, what does that have to do with me!

...

In the endless darkness.

The man in white was stunned again. How many years have passed?

Someone merged with the dao again!

After a while, the dao was severed again, did my successor die again?

Died again!

Died again!

"Ahhh!"

The man in white suddenly went mad, damn, what the hell is going on?

Did I sense it wrong?

Impossible!

One moment merging with the dao, the next severing it, damn your ancestors, what's happening!

Could it be that in an instant, millions of years have passed outside?

"I'm going to collapse, how many successors have I lost?"

He roared, truly going a bit mad, what exactly is happening?

How much is the time flow rate different, has the outside world passed millions of years?
