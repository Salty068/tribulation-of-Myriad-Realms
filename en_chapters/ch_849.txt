Chapter 849: I'm Back Again (Please Subscribe)

Should I seek out the Culture King? It's a tough decision because it seems like the Culture King isn't having the best time. Moreover, if I leave now, I'm worried something might go wrong. Fortunately, the Human Emperor hasn't completely fallen. If he were to die, I wouldn't be able to leave at all. I'd have to be cautious of the Myriad Races' counterattack. Even in his current state, the Human Emperor is still the Human Emperor, enough to deter some people.

...

Maybe I should contact Gui and chat about life. That's also a good option. The Human Emperor has made some arrangements concerning two of the Three Gates. I don't have the time, otherwise, I would have made some arrangements too. Knowing oneself and the enemy is essential for being a leader.

Su Yu noticed some of the strong individuals from both sides were currently conversing. He smiled and said, "The seniors on the Human Emperor's side are our old superiors, our predecessors. Some are even related to us. We don't have much to offer, but let's give them some soil and water from our homeland. As for any return gifts, there's no need. Our seniors have been fighting for so long, they don't have many treasures left!"

As he finished speaking, many people on Su Yu's side were momentarily stunned. Soon, a group of them silently took out some soil, water, and trees... When they were leaving, Su Yu had asked them to bring some, and everyone thought it was because Su Yu was nostalgic, thinking he might not return. But now... he used it for this?

The strong individuals on the Human Emperor's side were also taken aback. Seeing the soil and water from their homeland, they felt a complex mix of emotions. It had been many years since they had returned, even though the flow of time was different. Here, they had been fighting for hundreds or even thousands of years! Over the years, many comrades had died. Seeing these items now, they couldn't help but feel a bit emotional.

As for the return gifts... at this moment, Su Yu suddenly realized that the seniors were quite shameless. Many of them fumbled around in their pockets for a long time. Someone pulled out a bone, reminiscing that it was the strongest bone of a certain powerful individual... In reality, it was just a leftover from a meal, kept as a memento. It had been a long time since they had a decent meal. There were even teeth marks on the bone.

Su Yu was speechless!

Forget it!

A bunch of paupers.

Well, after so many years, the good stuff was used up. The Radiant King might still have some, but he wouldn't bleed himself dry either. The Human Emperor's side still needed some time to recuperate and stabilize their sea of will. Su Yu didn't disturb them and let the Human Emperor heal first. He walked to the side alone to chat with Gui about life.

...

In the sea of will.

Within the shadow of the Heaven Gate, a figure flickered in and out of view. An old man was panting heavily. Is the fight over yet? Not yet? The power he was outputting was becoming unsustainable. If this continued, he wouldn't be able to hold on. Su Yu was really a sponge for power. Who was he fighting?

He urged several times, but Su Yu ignored him. Feeling a bit helpless, he thought about retracting his power. Maintaining it continuously was exhausting.

Just as he was thinking this, Su Yu's voice echoed, "Bad luck! That guy is quite strong. Gui, you're a powerhouse comparable to the Human Emperor, yet your power output is so weak?"

Weak?

Gui could only attribute it to the Heaven Gate's excessive power consumption.

Is the fight over?

He quickly transmitted his voice, "The Heaven Gate consumes too much. Did you lose?"

"Heh, I just couldn't be bothered to argue with him!"

Gui instantly understood. He lost, but Su Yu ran away. This was just a stubborn refusal to admit defeat!

Quickly, Su Yu said directly, "Your power is lacking! If I rely on you, I'll end up dead by that guy's hands. Do you have a way to deal with him?"

"Of course I do!"

"Let's hear it!"

"Bring my true self out..."

Su Yu sneered, "Forget it, don't even think about it! Letting your will probe the Myriad Realms is already giving you face. If you come out, you'll probably kill me first!"

"How could that be!"

Gui quickly explained, "You're the intermediary. If you die, I won't be able to return to the Heaven Gate."

Heh!

You don't even want to go back, so why pretend?

Su Yu knew these guys' intentions well. They were all smart people, and everyone knew what was going on.

Su Yu didn't dwell on it and continued, "Gui, you know about the Culture King and his people, right?"

"I do."

"Are they dead?"

"No, they're still alive."

Seeing Su Yu bring up the Culture King, Gui didn't mind chatting about it. He casually said, "Now that the seal on the Myriad Realms is broken, are there many rulers of laws? Do you need me to give you some pointers?"

"No need, there aren't many. But with the Human Emperor and his people returning, there will be more. I feel it's happening soon! Once I stabilize the Myriad Realms, if the Human Emperor and his people haven't returned, I'll go find them myself!"

Speaking of this, Su Yu smiled, "Once I find the Human Emperor and his people, maybe I'll visit the Heaven Gate. How about that?"

"......"

Gui felt like laughing but still said, "You can come to the Heaven Gate, but it's more dangerous than you can imagine! Here, powerful beings are everywhere. Even someone like the Culture King isn't supreme here!"

Not supreme, but definitely not ordinary, otherwise, he wouldn't have said that.

Su Yu was curious, "How strong is the Culture King? Do you know?"

"It's hard to say. I'm not familiar with the Culture King."

Gui chuckled, knowing Su Yu was probably fishing for information. But he didn't mind piquing Su Yu's interest, saying, "In the Heaven Gate, there are many strong beings. The Culture King and the Martial King are outsiders! They don't belong to our era. Such beings entering the Heaven Gate... the Culture King isn't weak, and generally, people don't go out of their way to trouble him. However, the Culture King has a sister... who provoked a formidable enemy. They've been locked in battle for many years."

The Time Sage?

Su Yu was instantly intrigued, "Tell me, who did the Culture King's sister provoke? Even the Culture King can't solve this problem. He's the strongest in our Myriad Realms."

"Unspeakable! That being is very strong. In our era, they're among the top. If the Myriad Realms have some understanding... let's put it this way, they're on par with the Master of the Undead in your Death Realm, but with deeper foundations..."

Su Yu raised an eyebrow, on par with the Master of the Undead?

That's indeed incredibly powerful!

In Su Yu's understanding, the Master of the Undead was always considered the second strongest in the heavens, with the Master of Time being the first. Of course, it's said that the Human Ancestor could fight him one-on-one, but the truth of that is unknown.

The Time Sage provoked such a being, leading to her troubles and the Culture King's rescue...

How did she provoke them?

Su Yu speculated it might be related to the Book of Time or the Time Sage's path. Did she try to collect corpses of beings in the Heaven Gate?

And then ended up poking a hornet's nest?

That's a reasonable guess!

Gui, evidently unwilling to say more about that being, as they were too strong, and mentioning them in the same world could easily attract their attention.

Su Yu asked again, "Are there many such beings in the Heaven Gate?"

"Not many, very few! Extremely rare!"

Gui emphasized several times, very rare.

He quickly added, "So, the Culture King and his people, being able to entangle and battle for years, are indeed very powerful. That much is undeniable."

"And compared to you? Are you strong in the Heaven Gate?"

"Heh... they certainly can't compare to me!"

Gui boasted a bit, and Su Yu didn't want to say anything. Yeah, right, if you were the strongest in the Heaven Gate, I'd open it right now!

There's nothing to fear!

Su Yu thought for a moment and asked, "Can the Culture King and his people come out?"

"Difficult!"

Gui chuckled, "Easy to enter, hard to exit! If it were that easy, I'd have left myself and wouldn't need to lend you power."

He added, "Su Yu, you might be very strong now, with almost no opponents in the Myriad Realms. But if you witness the Heaven Gate, you'll understand how insignificant you are!"

This guy hasn't provided any useful information.

He's quite cunning!

Su Yu didn't want to waste time and quickly said, "Can you find the Culture King? If your power isn't enough, maybe let the Culture King lend me some power, or ask him if there's any treasure left in the Myriad Realms that can help me deal with that second-tier powerhouse?"

Find the Culture King!

Gui instantly understood Su Yu's intention. This guy is bold, but how could I possibly go looking for trouble myself?

"Culture King's whereabouts are uncertain, always being hunted by that being. Recently, even the Master of the Undead from the Myriad Realms' Death Realm joined the fray... The situation is getting more complicated. Finding the Culture King now might be difficult!"

Gui's words were half-truths, but Su Yu was a bit surprised. Did the Master of the Undead really go to trouble the Culture King and his people?

Not very forgiving!

Also, Gui isn't entirely honest, but that's normal. If he told you everything and helped you with everything, he wouldn't be an ancient existence. Both sides are just using each other!

Su Yu didn't mind this and straightforwardly asked, "Is there a way in the Heaven Gate to help me become first-tier? Or, is the cultivation system in the Heaven Gate the same as ours? Do they also cultivate myriad paths?"

"They also cultivate myriad paths!"

Gui gave a definite answer, and Su Yu was slightly moved. They also cultivate myriad paths... He couldn't help but ask, "Then why haven't I sensed so many ancient paths on the River of Time?"

"The myriad paths we cultivate are not quite the same as yours, though similar. Let's put it this way, you haven't seen them because you can't see them. The myriad paths we cultivate are all behind the Heaven Gate!"

The myriad paths behind the Heaven Gate?

Su Yu was momentarily stunned, the myriad paths behind the Heaven Gate.

His eyes suddenly flickered, "Let me ask you, is there a River of Time in the Heaven Gate?"

Gui fell silent for a moment before speaking, "Yes."

Su Yu's heart trembled, "So, there's a river inside and outside the Heaven Gate. The so-called sealed era..."

Su Yu kept thinking, kept pondering, and suddenly said, "The so-called sealed era, could it be... just sealing the segment of the River of Time from your era?"

He spoke in a deep voice, "So, all of you powerful beings are sealed behind the gate?"

Could it be that the river of time is incredibly long, and the paths opened by those people back then are at the end of the river? Later, when the Heaven Gate appeared, it sealed that section of the river, along with the world, leading to the saying that an era was sealed?

If that's the case, then did the Heaven Gate actually sever the river of time?

Is that how it is?

Countless thoughts surged in Su Yu's mind as he pondered. Suddenly, he asked, "Why do the beings within the Heaven Gate always want to come out and enter the Myriad Realms?"

Gui remained silent.

Su Yu pressed, "Can't you say, or are you unwilling to say?"

After a long pause, Gui finally gave a vague answer, "The past is the past; only the present is real. Living in the past is not as good as living in the present, don't you think?"

Su Yu vaguely understood something!

These beings want to come out because the Myriad Realms is the present, while they are part of the past!

Those within the Three Gates want to open this seal and let the past return to the present!

Though it sounded complex, Su Yu understood one thing clearly: these beings aim to occupy the Myriad Realms, whether for opportunities or other reasons, their target is the Myriad Realms!

He didn't ask further because Gui was not very cooperative and didn't want to talk. Sending him to find the Culture King seemed unlikely to succeed, and perhaps the Culture King was also in trouble at the moment.

Recalling some previous conversations and what the Human Emperor had said, Su Yu suddenly asked, "If we cultivate the paths of your world, what will happen?"

Gui was silent for a while before replying, "The path is the biggest distinction between those inside and outside the gate!"

Understood!

At that moment, Su Yu suddenly realized why the Time Sage didn't open the heavens within the Heaven Gate!

Because it couldn't be done there; if it were, the Time Sage would be considered someone inside the gate.

Moreover, he vaguely understood why the Death Path remained in the Death Realm, because the Lord of the Undead hadn't completely left the Myriad Realms. His path was still in the Myriad Realms.

That being might not be considered someone inside the gate either; he seemed to be waiting for an opportunity, leaving the Death Realm in the Myriad Realms.

Therefore, when Su Yu touched the Death Path, the other party projected himself immediately because he was unwilling to abandon it, still wanting to return!

Gui's few words gave Su Yu some preliminary understanding of those inside the gate.

They also cultivate myriad paths. During the era of opening the heavens, they indeed cultivated the power of myriad paths, but the paths they cultivated... Su Yu's eyes flickered. The Myriad Realms they were in back then might still be the current Myriad Realms, but was the river of time they were in back then still the current river?

The river... is flowing!

So, have their paths also shifted? In fact, the paths cultivated by the current myriad races are different from those back then, not in the same region?

The sealed era is just the river in that region being sealed?

Is the river of time a river... or a loop?

A closed loop!

And the section of the river we are in is just a segment of it?

Did the Heaven Gate and Human Gate sever this closed loop?

At this moment, Su Yu truly began to ponder what the river of time is, what it looks like, where its end is, and what the purpose of the Three Gates' seal is, what it represents?

And in all this, the Time Sage is the key!

Perhaps, he was close to touching the core!

With these thoughts in mind, Su Yu lost interest in Gui. Forget it, just continue nurturing my world, Su Yu quickly said, "Don't retract your power, strengthen my physical body a bit! That guy has been bothering me lately, better to avoid a surprise attack!"

"You still want more?"

Gui was a bit overwhelmed!

This guy is truly crazy. Aren't you afraid of me coming out?

Or do you not know that if my power permeates for a long time, once all my power is positioned in the Myriad Realms, I can directly descend through your Heaven Gate's shadow?

My descent... is first-class!

A supreme existence!

You're just a fourth-class, aren't you afraid of death?

At this moment, he also understood the division of the Myriad Realms, which wasn't much different from his era. Of course, they preferred to talk about the power of paths, which was more intuitive.

"Fine!"

Thinking to himself, Gui still agreed. Although the consumption was great, I am rooting quickly. I can feel it; my power seems to be rooting somewhere, maybe I can descend soon!

Of course, Su Yu was also clear.

Rooting where?

In my world!

If the old guy descends, he would descend into my world, where the power is most concentrated. If not there, then where?

I welcome it!

Just hope you're not afraid, in my world, I might not easily kill you, right?

...

After chatting with Gui for a while, Su Yu stood up.

In the distance, a group of people quickly looked over. The Human Emperor's people had just chatted for a while and knew some of Su Yu's situation. At this moment, they were still a bit surprised. According to Su Yu's people, this guy was really formidable!

Without any evidence, if it were before, they would just listen.

But earlier, they had witnessed this person leading his people to eliminate nearly 30 rulers of laws with zero losses, killing more than they had in countless years combined.

"Xingyue!"

Su Yu called out, and Xingyue, who was helping others heal, looked up at him. Su Yu directly said, "Merge that Nether Death Path! That path has reached second-class, and with the Death Path, it's considered a similar path. After merging, you'll be second-class. My world can now support a second-class existence!"

"Oh!"

Xingyue nodded, not having too many thoughts, nor was she particularly excited.

Second-class?

Quite normal!

Back then, the Radiant King said she would eventually catch up to the Immortal Emperor, and Xingyue thought, with Su Yu's strength, catching up to the Immortal Emperor was quite normal.

Now, it's just a second-class.

The Immortal Emperor is still first-class, so there's still a long way to go, no need to be excited!

And the Nether Death Path is considered a Death Path. Xingyue, who holds the Life Path of the Myriad Realms, suddenly said, "Should I merge the Life Path of the Myriad Realms into your world too? This way, life and death might both reach second-class, achieving a balance?"

Previously, life and death were unbalanced, with her Life Path being stronger.

But now, with Su Yu having an additional Death Path, merging them might achieve a balance!

Both paths reaching second-class!

Second-class requires at least 8 paths of power. Merging two paths of 8 paths of power won't instantly become a 16-path first-class, but it should exceed 10 paths of power!

If operated well and merged well, it might quickly reach 12 or even 14 paths of power, which is not impossible.

Su Yu fell into contemplation. Should he let Xingyue merge her Life Path too?

At this moment, the Radiant King hurriedly said, "Xingyue, don't. You should ask His Majesty's opinion on this..."

"Why?"

Xingyue was puzzled, "Cultivation is a personal matter. My brother may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I have to listen to him for my cultivation, because we cultivate different paths. He doesn't know the Life and Death Path, so why should I listen to him?"

"......"

The Radiant King was speechless!

But he was anxious!

If you merge everything into Su Yu's world, it will all become part of Su Yu. Now it's fine, at least your Life Path is in the river of time, but if you merge everything...

How could he not be anxious?

The Human Emperor had gone into seclusion to stabilize his sea of will, and no one dared to disturb him now.

Xingyue wanted to merge the Life Path, and everyone wanted to persuade her, but they didn't know how!

Su Yu didn't bother with them, considering for a moment, he said, "It's not impossible, but if you merge and my world collapses, you'll be completely doomed. Before, there was still a bit of hope!"

"You are my subordinate. If I merge, will you become stronger? If you become stronger, you'll continue to serve me, right?"

"......"

Around them, a group of people had strange expressions. What subordinate?

Your subordinate!

This subordinate didn't even give face to the Martial King before, scolding as she pleased. Su Yu was not someone easy to deal with. Everyone knew that from the first meeting.

Su Yu, however, smiled and nodded, "True, the lady has a point! Alright, merge then. Your brother is struggling to protect himself now. If anyone's going to die, he might go before me. I should still be behind him."

So, whether to merge or not, it was just like that!

Su Yu didn't bother with Xingyue anymore and quickly looked at the Martial Emperor. At this moment, the Martial Emperor was standing alone in the distance, melancholic, not wanting to talk to anyone.

The Human Emperor's people knew he had a grudge with the Martial King, so they didn't want to talk to him.

Su Yu's people always saw the Martial Emperor as a formidable figure, so he couldn't bring himself to chat with them. At this moment, while others were chatting, he was the only one sitting quietly, watching the river's scenery.

Su Yu directly said, "Martial Emperor, go merge the Physical Path. After merging, you'll be second-class!"

This was also one of the only two second-class paths in his world.

The Martial Emperor's eyes suddenly lit up, and soon, he coughed lightly, maintaining his composure, "This seat cultivates the Martial Path..."

Physical Path, I don't care for it!

Su Yu couldn't be bothered, saying indifferently, "Then forget it!"

"Don't!"

The Martial Emperor couldn't care about face anymore. Damn, I want to merge, I want to become second-class!

Su Yu continued, "Later, I'll tell you how to connect with the beings in the Heaven Gate. Connect with one, borrow some power, and no matter what they say, remember one thing: seal your sea of will. Also, say what should be said, and what shouldn't be... just exclude the last five years, and then say whatever you want!"

There's no point in giving the Martial Emperor a gag order. Not mentioning the last five years, anything else the beings in the Heaven Gate ask is inconsequential!

Once the Martial Emperor and Xingyue merge these two paths, they will both step into second-class.

In this way, his side's strength will also increase a bit.

Su Yu finished arranging matters with the Martial Emperor and then turned to Tongtian, beckoning him over. Without saying much, he turned and led Tongtian away, his voice echoing behind him, "I'm heading downstream to harness some of the power of the heavens and earth. Wait for me here!"

With those words, he vanished.

The Radiant King and the others were taken aback. Where was he going? The Human Emperor was currently in seclusion, healing. He shouldn't be wandering off.

After Su Yu left, the Radiant King couldn't help but ask, "Where is the Human Lord going? It's not very safe for him to leave at this moment..."

Wan Tiansheng chuckled softly, "Don't worry, His Majesty knows what he's doing. He's just going out for a look. There's no need to be concerned."

Seeing Wan Tiansheng's confidence, the Radiant King had no choice but to drop the matter. However, he pondered whether Su Yu intended to head to the Myriad Realms. Previously, it wasn't feasible to leave, as the myriad races would notice the absence and might intervene. But now that Su Yu had disappeared, the problem shouldn't be significant. There were many rulers of laws here, and the myriad races, having suffered losses, might not dare to interfere.

Still, the Radiant King reminded everyone, "We mustn't wander off. If we all leave and return to the Myriad Realms with the myriad races, the Three Gates will open!"

Their presence here also served to seal the Three Gates. The old powerhouses knew this, but he worried the others might not understand and suddenly leave, which would cause significant trouble.

"Rest assured!" Wan Tiansheng laughed, "We won't wander off!"

The Radiant King had no choice but to remain silent.

...

Meanwhile, Tongtian couldn't help but ask, "Your Majesty, where are we going?"

"To the Myriad Realms!" Su Yu replied as he flowed downstream. "But I'm worried about an anomaly in the flow speed, accelerating everyone's return. You're a portal; help me conceal it and assist with the transmission. We need to be quick and not waste time!"

"...Alright!" Tongtian felt a bit strange. Returning to the Myriad Realms? You just got here! And if you leave, what happens if the myriad races attack while the Human Emperor is in seclusion? Aren't you worried about trouble?

Su Yu, aware of his thoughts, casually said, "Don't worry. As long as the Human Emperor is alive, it's not a big problem. If he were truly dead, I wouldn't dare to leave!"

As long as he was alive, even if incapacitated, he was still the Human Emperor. Even if Su Yu wasn't around, the Human Emperor's orders would suffice, as long as they weren't suicidal.

Tongtian didn't say more and began the transmission. In this place, only he could do so; others, including the Space Ancient Beast Race, couldn't transmit people. Thus, the spatial path here was more about destructive power than transmission, which was greatly limited.

...

Su Yu continued transmitting, needing to return to the Myriad Realms for several reasons. First, there was the matter of the Great Zhou King. This guy had integrated into Su Yu's world, and Su Yu wanted to see if he still had second-tier power. Perhaps he did, having mastered many great daos and quickly grasped them after integrating into Su Yu's world.

Second, there was the matter of the Culture King's world. If he could find it, he might truly contact the Culture King, which would be immensely useful!

Third, returning to the Myriad Realms, where time flowed faster, would allow him to spend a month absorbing and digesting the power of the heavens and earth. Returning here would only take a day or two, saving a lot of time.

For these reasons, during this rare period of peace, Su Yu needed to quickly strengthen himself. The stronger he became, the stronger his subordinates would be. Otherwise, waiting for everyone to slowly grow stronger would take forever!

This time, with the help of Marquis Tongtian, Su Yu quickly sensed he was nearing the Myriad Realms. However, this return felt different.

As they reached a node, Su Yu paused, sensing a surge of murderous intent as if it wanted to kill him. But it quickly dissipated, as if recognizing something.

"King Yue?" Su Yu was surprised. The node guarded by King Yue—he hadn't expected that even after King Yue's death, he could still sense some things and continue guarding this node!

Su Yu hadn't thought much about it before, but now he couldn't help but stop here. He knew that before King Yue died, he had swallowed his own great dao, containing a final strike within himself!

King Yue wasn't weak. Back then, Su Yu couldn't see through him. Now, looking back, King Yue might have been a third-tier ruler of laws. Back then, even the Battle King was only third-tier, so he wasn't too weak.

"Leaving a final strike here... and some remaining will..."

Su Yu murmured. Could King Yue be revived? The revival through the Death Path was impossible, as it couldn't summon such a powerful existence. But could King Yue's last trace of will be revived?

A warrior who fought to the end and continued to guard, completing the Human Emperor's task—such a warrior, whether or not he was Su Yu's subordinate, was someone Su Yu wanted to save.

Previously, he thought the other party was completely dead, with no hope. But now, as Su Yu stepped into this node, King Yue's trace of will could still discern whether someone was human. That was different.

It meant King Yue might not be completely dead?

Su Yu originally intended to return to his world but suddenly changed his mind. He quickly tore open a passage and descended through the channel guarded by King Yue.

...

On the ninth floor of the Luminous Domain Mansion.

Ruins and debris everywhere!

A corpse floated in the air, standing proudly with an arrogant expression. That was King Yue, the first ancient Human King Su Yu had discovered who died in battle.

Back then, Su Yu felt a life-threatening aura from him. Now, he didn't feel that way.

But as he descended and looked at King Yue, his eyes still flickered.

"Swallowing the dao into the belly!"

This one was a true ruthless person!

Su Yu carefully observed. King Yue was indeed formidable. He had swallowed his entire great dao, integrating it into his sea of will, which had long since fallen silent. But with a slight fluctuation, it might unleash a thunderous strike!

"The last strike of life? Killing a third-tier is no problem, but a second-tier... it's hard to say!"

At this moment, Marquis Tongtian also looked at King Yue, feeling a bit emotional, "He was very domineering back then. I didn't expect him to die here, his corpse floating for ten thousand years... I couldn't come up before, or I would have given him a proper burial."

Su Yu laughed, "Come on, if you had tried to bury him before, he would have speared you to death. Being from the Gate Race wouldn't have helped!"

Saying this, Su Yu looked at King Yue, raising an eyebrow slightly, "He might still be alive!"

"Dead, isn't he?" Marquis Tongtian was speechless. Could he still be alive?

Su Yu's eyes flickered, "He's almost dead, but there's still a trace of will! If I place him in my world, he might survive, reconnecting with the great dao... But he followed the spear path, which the Great Qin King occupies. Even if he survives, he might not accept changing paths..."

At this, Su Yu suddenly smiled, "Let's find the Culture King's world first. If I find it, I'll place him there and see. Maybe the Culture King still has the spear path. No, the Culture King's world might not have anyone integrated into it. Even if it does, it might not be closed..."

Thinking of this, Su Yu added, "Interesting, the Culture King's pen dao... actually suits him!"

Pen dao?

Marquis Tongtian was taken aback. Pen dao and spear dao aren't the same, are they?

Su Yu thought the difference wasn't significant. A pen, isn't it just a spear pointing upwards? What's the difference?

Su Yu carefully observed King Yue again and didn't look further. At this moment, he couldn't place him in his world. King Yue didn't recognize him, and that last trace of will might not acknowledge him either.

The Culture King, however, was familiar to him, so there was hope.

"Completely swallowed the spear dao. No wonder the Great Qin King and others couldn't break through the spear dao. It wasn't because someone was mastering it, but because this ruthless person swallowed it whole... If he can integrate into the pen dao, which is now mastered by Nan Wujiang and others... with cooperation, maybe he can become a top-tier powerhouse!"

The spirit of the great dao can wield the power of the great dao. However, if someone cooperates and masters the great dao, they might be even stronger!

Of course, this was just speculation. Reviving this guy wouldn't be easy.

...

Su Yu lingered on the ninth floor for a while before leaving. Marquis Tongtian transmitted for a while, and soon, Su Yu returned to the Upper Realm. The Great Zhou King quickly sensed him and appeared instantly.

Seeing Su Yu, he was stunned.

Back so soon...?

Do you do everything this quickly?

It hadn't been long since Su Yu left, certainly not a month!

In the Great Zhou King's mind, with travel time and the return journey, plus battles... how could it be less than a month? The time flow was different, so did you finish fighting and then return, or what?

Didn't fight?

That couldn't be. He sensed Su Yu's world expanding, so he must have fought!

"Your Majesty... you're back?" the Great Zhou King murmured. Su Yu smiled, "Just came back to check. I just killed 30 rulers of laws, and the situation there has improved a lot. I came back to see how things are."

"30?"

The Great Zhou King felt a toothache. You madman, indeed, your arrival marked the beginning of slaughter!

Su Yu glanced at him and smiled, "Not bad. After merging the dao, it seems you haven't dropped to second-tier!"

"Your Majesty's world has grown stronger!" the Great Zhou King explained, "It can maintain the level without dropping."

"That's good!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, "Come, let's visit the Human Emperor's world and see if there's a way to extract some power of the great dao. Even if the Human Emperor's world is ruined, it's still powerful. Extracting some might weaken it, which would actually benefit him."

Too powerful, and it's unsuitable for the Human Emperor to integrate. His sea of will is too fragile now!

This return also aimed to help the Human Emperor recover. Of course, this was just a side goal, as Su Yu couldn't guarantee success. It was a case of treating a dead horse as if it were alive!

Hearing this, the Great Zhou King hurriedly said, "His Majesty the Human Emperor..."

"Not dead yet. His body has collapsed, his sea of will has collapsed, but he can live for a few more days. It's nothing! Just a small matter!"

"..."

Is that even human speech?

The physical body has collapsed, the sea of will has shattered, and yet he can still live for a few days. Is this considered a minor issue?

The Great Zhou King felt like crying. How pitiful! I knew that once His Majesty the Human Emperor left, there would be no good outcome. But to end up in such a miserable state!

After nurturing it for countless years, he goes out and perishes!

Indeed, following Su Yu in his madness will make him stronger, while everyone else will suffer misfortune. The stronger they are, the worse their fate!

Before he could finish his thoughts, Su Yu grabbed him, and in an instant, they vanished, stepping into the Dao Source Land in the blink of an eye!
