Chapter 693: The Pacification of the Four Realms

Tens of thousands of Phoenix Race members had been captured, their faces filled with terror, fear, hatred, and resentment. Their grievances soared to the heavens, yet they were powerless to change anything.

Su Yu, however, did not spare them much attention. He glanced at the sky and suddenly chuckled, "I won't kill you. I came here not to take lives but to seek mutual cooperation and benefit. Killing is not the solution."

At this moment, Su Yu even released the willpower of those in the Eternal Realm, including the Phoenix Emperor's. These Eternals, including the Phoenix Emperor, could now hear Su Yu's words as a bit of their willpower seeped through.

With a gentle smile, Su Yu continued, "I am here to resolve the war among the myriad races, not for senseless slaughter. But I know that mere words are useless, so I had to subdue you all before discussing peace."

"If I wanted to annihilate the Phoenix Race, I could do so right now!"

"But extermination is not my wish!"

Su Yu spoke softly, "Therefore, I offer you a choice. I can release one Eternal to manage the Phoenix Realm, but the rest, including the Phoenix Emperor, must be detained! If not, you know well that you will soon become my enemies!"

At this moment, the Great Zhou King and others hesitated to speak.

In the void, those whose willpower had seeped through were surprised, shocked, and excited.

He won't kill us? He won't destroy the Phoenix Race?

The Phoenix Emperor was also somewhat excited, her voice sharp, "Are you serious?"

The Phoenix Realm had been defeated, utterly defeated. Annihilation was imminent. Was this Su Yu's delaying tactic?

The Phoenix Emperor's voice was sharp, "Are you afraid that killing us will cause upheaval in the Myriad Realms, Su Yu? Are you just delaying our deaths?"

Su Yu chuckled, "Naive! Even if I were delaying, what could you do? If I killed all those below the Eternal Realm, could you, Phoenix Emperor, self-destruct?"

"I'm merely giving you a chance. Endless slaughter cannot unify the Myriad Realms. I didn't understand the Human Emperor or the Hundred Battle King before, but now I do. Killing only breeds disaster."

Su Yu, with a compassionate tone, continued, "Today, I have been deeply moved. Whether you are willing or not, the choice is yours. I leave you a path to survival. If you don't care, then give it up."

Extermination!

The Phoenix Emperor's projection flickered for a moment before she quickly said, "I agree! Su Yu, if you release me, I can serve you..."

"No need."

Su Yu replied calmly, "I seek peace in the Myriad Realms, not trouble. If I release you, a Daofuse cultivator, am I an idiot? Find a low-tier Eternal to manage the Phoenix Realm! And they must be under my control. I seek peace, not betrayal. Does the Phoenix Emperor think I'm as foolish as Tiangu?"

He wore a mocking smile. The Phoenix Emperor's will projection was silent for a moment before she said, "Fine, I agree!"

In truth, there was no choice. It was either annihilation or finding a low-tier Eternal to manage the Phoenix Realm.

The Phoenix Emperor pondered Su Yu's intentions. Not killing them was understandable; even if he killed everyone below the Eternal Realm, it wouldn't matter much. Why didn't Su Yu kill them? She couldn't quite understand. Was he trying to win hearts? Or was he trying to win over people like her?

The Phoenix Emperor couldn't figure it out. She could only assume that Su Yu hoped to subdue the Phoenix Realm through means other than extermination. Perhaps that was why he didn't destroy them. This was good; it meant there was still hope.

Just moments ago, the Phoenix Emperor had thought the Phoenix Realm was doomed.

Su Yu smiled and looked at the captured Phoenix Race members, saying with a faint smile, "In a war between races, it's either you or me. I, Su Yu, have been merciful enough not to destroy your race! There's no need to be hostile towards me. You simply chose the wrong side!"

"From now on, focus on cultivating. I hope your people can see the situation clearly! But just in case... Great Zhou King, let's set up a grand array in the Phoenix Realm to prevent any information from leaking!"

Su Yu said indifferently, "You can try to communicate with the outside world, but if discovered, the disaster of annihilation may descend at any time! Once we set up the array, you won't be able to send messages out! The realm passage is sealed, and the Death Realm is my territory. I want to see how you plan to leave the realm!"

The Phoenix Race members remained silent. Staying alive was already better than they had expected.

At this moment, the South King couldn't help but frown, "Human Lord, not wiping them out will eventually lead to future troubles! This Phoenix Race..."

Su Yu raised his hand, "Slaughter is not my true intent!"

"But..."

The South King still felt uneasy. Su Yu smiled, "The Phoenix Emperor and others are suppressed by me. Only a few weak ones remain. If the Phoenix Emperor dares to act, I will kill her and destroy her race. Rest assured, I am not blindly merciful!"

Alright.

The South King was helpless. She felt that today's Su Yu was indeed much more merciful than usual. This wasn't like Su Yu's style. What was going on?

At this moment, Su Yu didn't say much. He looked at the Great Zhou King and smiled, "Great Zhou King, let's set up the grand array in the Phoenix Realm to prevent them from communicating with the outside world!"

With that, a large seal flew out, the Great Ming Seal left in the Phoenix Realm.

Su Yu said, "Use the Great Ming Seal as the core to set up the array. If there's any disturbance, we can open the necromancer passage at any time to destroy the Phoenix Realm!"

"Additionally, secretly deploy three Human Eternal experts to the Phoenix Realm to suppress any disturbances!"

"The Phoenix Emperor and others are suppressed by me. A mere low-tier Eternal can be suppressed at any time!"

"......"

Su Yu gave orders one by one, and the Phoenix Race experts listened without finding anything amiss. Su Yu's stance seemed genuinely aimed at subduing the Phoenix Realm.

If he had simply left them here without care, they would have worried about his ulterior motives.

Su Yu quickly added, "At the realm passage, deploy two Daofuse experts to guard and suppress! Although they will be suppressed, they still possess Eternal power! If a war breaks out, they can break the seal and fight their way out!"

"......"

Command after command was issued, and the Great Zhou King noted them all down. In his heart, he still found it somewhat strange.

Not destroying the realm? Fine, but why keep these people? Even if worried about the Phoenix Realm causing too much commotion, just crippling them would suffice. Su Yu, however, didn't even cripple them!

He couldn't understand Su Yu's intentions!

After giving these instructions, Su Yu soared into the sky and quickly said, "Let's begin, set up the array!"

The Great Zhou King had no choice but to ascend and begin setting up the silent array.

Su Yu, on the other hand, didn't bother with it. He suppressed the Phoenix Emperor and others once more. At this moment, with his Heaven Gate open, he could vaguely see a phoenix soaring in the sky above the Phoenix Realm.

That was the Phoenix Race's Great Dao!

"Killing them would be a waste. Let them nurture the Book of Dao for me!"

Su Yu thought to himself. Killing them would be too wasteful. Absorbing blood essence was only temporary. How could it compare to having them nurture his strength continuously?

A group of experts, all eager to cultivate, grow stronger, and seek revenge...

At this moment, they had the greatest motivation to cultivate!

"However, the Phoenix Race's Great Dao is hard to pinpoint. No matter, I won't bother with the Upper Realm. I'll just distribute the book pages into the local Dao."

While the Great Zhou King was setting up the array, Su Yu was tearing the Phoenix Race's book page into countless pieces.

He carefully observed, watching each Great Dao, and quickly integrated the small book pages into the Phoenix Race experts' Great Dao.

Some Sunmoon Realm experts had vaguely touched upon the Great Dao, so Su Yu integrated them as well.

As for those below the Sunmoon Realm, they hadn't touched the Great Dao yet, but the myriad races actually had embryonic forms of the Great Dao, which were their racial abilities. Racial abilities were essentially embryonic forms of the Great Dao.

Only the Human Race, below the Sunmoon Realm, truly couldn't access the power of the Great Dao.

Su Yu continued to arrange and integrate his book pages into these people's Great Dao.

If he had enough strength now, he would directly tear through the River of Time and integrate the book pages into the Phoenix Race's Great Dao.

However, Su Yu couldn't do that now.

Moreover, there were still strong experts in the Phoenix Race's Upper Realm who hadn't been suppressed. Forcibly integrating would easily be discovered, and it would be difficult to integrate.

He could only disperse them, integrating them into small Daos. Perhaps, as these small Daos grew stronger, they could eventually forcibly merge with the Phoenix Race's Great Dao.

While the Great Zhou King was setting up the array, he was also observing Su Yu.

He didn't know what Su Yu was up to, but seeing Su Yu constantly producing what seemed like torn pages, he was secretly shocked.

In any case, he felt that Su Yu wasn't so kind-hearted!

This guy wasn't a good person.

Not destroying the Phoenix Realm was one thing, but releasing an Eternal to manage the Phoenix Realm and prevent chaos... This was truly unbelievable.

Now, Su Yu was taking advantage of the array setup to do something underhanded.

"Is that his Mark of Civilization?"

"Tearing the pages of the Mark of Civilization, what is he doing?"

The Great Zhou King saw Su Yu, sweating profusely, clearly consuming a lot of energy, and it didn't seem like he was up to anything good.

After a while, Su Yu, panting, flew over and smiled, "Great Zhou King, is the setup complete?"

"Yes!"

The Great Zhou King nodded, "Now..."

"You go back first, deploy two Daofuse experts to guard, and summon three Human Eternal experts to oversee this realm! If we take down all four realms, follow this example. We need eight Daofuse experts to guard and twelve Human Eternal experts. We can't let everyone be idle, can we?"

Su Yu smiled, "With so many people, what are they doing idle?"

He continued, "Ideally, each realm should have a Human Daofuse expert to guard, but there are too few Daofuse experts among the Human Race! I plan to assign Tian Yue to oversee the Dragon Realm. You and Chief Wan, I still need your help... So, we can only hope that others can quickly enter the Daofuse Realm."

The Great Zhou King nodded, "There's still a chance. After changing their Daos, everyone is progressing quickly. The Great Han King, Great Tang King, Great Shang King, and Great Song King all have a chance to step into the Daofuse Realm!"

Su Yu nodded slightly.

Without saying much, he quickly released a low-tier Eternal expert who had been suppressed.

At this moment, the low-tier Eternal expert's face turned pale as he looked at Su Yu, unsure of what to say.

Su Yu, on the other hand, was quite amiable, smiling as he said, "As long as you manage the Phoenix Realm properly and no major incidents occur, you can act as the acting Phoenix Emperor! Of course, if you decide to stir up trouble, then the Phoenix Emperor and the other dozen or so Eternals will only face death! You could even try to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the Phoenix Emperor and the others!"

The strong individuals of the Phoenix Realm all heard these words. Below, a group of Sunmoon Realm cultivators remained silent, not uttering a word.

Su Yu chuckled lightly, "I will arrange for people to oversee the realm. They won't interfere with you normally, but if there's any disturbance, they will quickly suppress and kill you. Weigh the pros and cons yourself!"

"Seventy percent of the Phoenix Realm's resources will be handed over, and the rest you can use for your own cultivation. I won't stop you!"

"In dealing with you, I consider myself to have been quite benevolent!"

The released Eternal took a deep breath, suppressing the unease that had yet to settle in his heart, and said in a deep voice, "Su... Su Human Lord, when will you release the strong individuals of my race?"

Seventy percent of the resources was a minor issue. Having people stationed was also a minor issue. His only concern was what would happen to those captured strong individuals.

Su Yu smiled, "Actually, I don't plan to kill them. Even suppressing them is too much trouble for me! I will find a small realm to detain them. Even if a Daofuse expert enters, they will only be Eternal! The captured Phoenix Race experts will either be detained in the Iron Devourer Realm or in the allied realms of my race! As long as they behave, cultivate when they should, and act as they should, I won't interfere too much!"

Upon hearing this, the Eternal felt a surge of joy. Just detention! This... this was much better than expected!

Su Yu said calmly, "The premise is that they must behave! Don't force me to exterminate your race!"

As he spoke, another projection of will appeared in the void. The Phoenix Emperor's face was heavy, "Is the Human Lord really just detaining us? If so, for the sake of our race and ourselves, we will not make any moves!"

Su Yu smiled faintly, "I hope so!"

The Phoenix Emperor secretly breathed a sigh of relief. This was the best possible outcome. She hadn't expected that Su Yu would not only refrain from killing them but wouldn't even seal them, merely detaining them in various realms! A good thing! This was much better than being detained in the Human Realm! This meant there was still a chance, a significant chance.

At this moment, the citizens of the Phoenix Race also transitioned from despair to joy, unable to suppress their excitement. Not a single one would be killed! This... was too unexpected. They had thought they were completely doomed this time!

Over there, the South King and others were somewhat restless. Not killing them? Not even suppressing them? Just detaining them in various realms—this... Su Yu's actions were too prone to backfire!

Su Yu had always been decisive; why was he so indecisive today? Out of trust in Su Yu, these necromancers could only suppress their thoughts, feeling utterly helpless.

Su Yu quickly said, "By the way, the Phoenix Realm's council tokens need to be handed over. How many are there?"

"Only two."

The Phoenix Emperor was extremely cooperative at this moment, quickly saying, "They're in my heavenly weapon; you can look for them."

"Good!"

Su Yu chuckled and quickly said, "Then the Great Zhou King should return first, bring people here to suppress this realm!"

"Understood!"

The Great Zhou King said no more, quickly entering the necromancer passage. Bringing living people here could easily cause a disturbance in the Celestial River of Death, but the Great Zhou King was extremely skilled at concealing his presence. Bringing a few people over wouldn't be a big problem.

Su Yu didn't leave but maintained the passage open, and the necromancers didn't move again to prevent any spread that might trigger a punishment from the rules. This battle had almost no casualties.

...

After waiting for a while, the Great Zhou King returned with people. The two stationed were Zhou Chi and Frost Shadow, and the three human Eternals were the Great Tang King, the Great Yong King, and the Great Liang King.

They were all shocked! The two stationed were fine, but the three human Eternals were seeing so many necromancer marquises for the first time, all with incredibly powerful auras that made them feel apprehensive. Not only that, but the two Daofuse stationed also left them deeply shaken.

The human race had quietly taken control of the Phoenix Realm, something they had not anticipated at all. Unbelievable!

"Greetings, Emperor Yu!"

The several powerful individuals, including Zhou Chi, were extremely respectful. Taking control of the Phoenix Realm was beyond everyone's expectations. It was too incredible, without a single sound.

Su Yu smiled, "Next, your task is to station here. It might take quite some time. Once the war of the Myriad Realms breaks out again, if Tiangu wants the Phoenix Realm to join the battle, you can assist Tiangu!"

Su Yu smiled, and the others were momentarily stunned before they all burst into laughter! One could imagine that if a great war truly broke out again, and Tiangu was waiting for reinforcements from the Phoenix Realm, only for a few Daofuse experts from the human side to emerge and backstab them, it would probably make them cry.

"Great Tang King!"

The Great Tang King quickly restrained his smile and looked at Su Yu, awaiting instructions.

Su Yu smiled, "You few human Eternals, in this realm, the source qi is abundant. The Phoenix Realm will hand over seventy percent of its resources, and I will leave thirty percent for you three. The Great Tang King is most likely to advance to Daofuse... I hope you can advance soon! If you are about to advance to Daofuse, you can notify me in advance, and I will take you to a place to advance. Don't advance here; the commotion will be too great!"

"Understood!"

The Great Tang King quickly responded, saying solemnly, "I will do my best!"

With ample resources, of course, at his level, it was more about comprehension.

Su Yu smiled, "I will come when I have time, take you on a few trips along the River of Time! If the Phoenix Realm behaves, don't interfere with their affairs, let them be!"

Saying this, he added, "Even if someone in the Phoenix Realm proves the Dao of Eternity, let them be!"

Upon hearing this, not only the Great Tang King and others but also a group of strong individuals from the Phoenix Realm were stunned.

The Eternal who was to govern the Phoenix Realm was shocked, whispering, "Human Lord, is this... is this true?"

Our race advancing, and you won't interfere? This... made him feel uneasy. Could there be a conspiracy?

Su Yu said indifferently, "A bunch of trash Sunmoon advancing, merging with the Phoenix Race's Dao, is actually a good thing! I wish for more of these trash, to seize the Phoenix Race's Dao power. You don't understand, but the Phoenix Emperor probably does!"

At this moment, the Phoenix Emperor's phantom reappeared, looking at Su Yu, then at the strong individuals of the Phoenix Race below, sighing, "Su Human Lord... has a deep understanding of the Dao. It is only in recent years that I have gained some insight..."

Su Yu sneered, "Because you're all useless! What use is Eternity? It would be best if the Phoenix Race produced a hundred more, and even better if they produced Daofuse, dispersing the power of rules of your upper realm Phoenix Race experts. That's what I want to see!"

Although many didn't understand the Phoenix Emperor's words, they generally knew that Su Yu seemed to have no ill intentions. He wouldn't stop them from advancing. Because Su Yu believed that this could disperse the power of rules of the upper realm Phoenix Race.

However, the Phoenix Emperor thought to herself that Su Yu was overconfident! The Phoenix Race didn't have many Daofuse, even if three to five more advanced, it wouldn't actually seize the Dao power of other Phoenix Race experts. It could only be said that Su Yu was overthinking, overestimating the Phoenix Race, as there weren't many Daofuse in the upper realm Phoenix Race either. A single Dao, merging, could produce ten Daofuse.

"Alright, enough with the nonsense!"

Su Yu looked at Zhou Chi and the others, "Rest assured in guarding this realm. If there's nothing, then fine. If there is... kill! Although I am merciful, I won't hesitate to be ruthless!"

At this moment, the Phoenix Emperor's phantom sighed, "My race's people, behave, cultivate well!"

The Phoenix Emperor looked at the Eternal, "Feng Qi, take care... don't anger these people... the future of the Phoenix Race... is in your hands!"

She was also warning Feng Qi to be low-key, to not cause trouble. Now, the Phoenix Race still had a chance. Causing trouble might lead to extermination.

"Emperor, I will!"

The low-tier Eternal expert responded solemnly, understanding the Phoenix Emperor's meaning: be low-key, dormant, patient, and don't provoke the human race now.

Su Yu smiled and said, "I hope everything goes well. Everyone, I will leave this realm first, to take control of other realms, so that the Myriad Realms will all be under the control of my Emperor Yu's Mansion!"

"Farewell, Emperor Yu!"

Zhou Chi and the others all looked on with admiration, watching Su Yu leave quickly with a large number of strong individuals.

After they left, the Great Yong King, as if in a dream, looked at the Great Tang King and murmured, "Old Tang, did we... did we take control of the Phoenix Realm?"

"Yes!"

The Great Tang King was also filled with emotion, at this moment, he looked at Zhou Chi, hesitated, but still asked, "Senior Zhou Chi, you... have you reached Daofuse?"

Zhou Chi smiled, "Reached Daofuse! Not just us, counting Heavendoom and the others, now including the boss, we have 11 Daofuse experts!"

Gasp!

The Great Tang King was shocked, and with so many necromancer experts, Su Yu had quietly hidden so many Daofuse without even the human Eternals knowing.

This meant that in the previous battle, the human race hadn't even used their full strength!

Zhou Chi continued to smile, "Emperor Yu's idea is simple: hide our strength, don't let the upper realm be wary, don't let other races despair, secretly take control of various realms. As you saw, the Phoenix Realm was taken without losing a single soldier! Once a great war breaks out, we can also launch from the Phoenix Realm at any time!"

He said this, looking at the Great Tang King, "You are now on the path of Weapon Fusion, feel free to exchange insights with us. We've cultivated for over a hundred thousand years, our understanding of the Dao may not be deep, but we have experience in Weapon Fusion! Emperor Yu has granted you thirty percent of the Phoenix Realm's resources, mainly to strengthen your Weapon Fusion! In this way, once your understanding of the Dao reaches a certain level, advancing to Daofuse won't be difficult!"

"Thank you, senior!"

The Great Tang King was delighted. A senior with over a hundred thousand years of experience in Weapon Fusion willing to guide him was a great boon. This could save him from many detours.

The Great Tang King sighed, "Our human race has now produced a few Daofuse, but unfortunately, we are still lacking. Without Daofuse combat power, it's hard to keep up. I hope that during this period of guarding, I can step into the Daofuse realm."

"There is hope!"

Chapter 1: The Emperor's Strategy

The Celestial River of Death.

Su Yu stood with his hands behind his back, gazing into the distance. The South Heavenly King approached, a frown etched on his face. "Human Lord, do you truly intend to send them to other realms for suppression?"

Su Yu nodded. "Indeed."

Seeing the South Heavenly King's lingering concern, Su Yu transmitted a message, "Worry not, Master’s wife. I am not foolish enough to raise a tiger to threaten myself. I have my plans—to let the myriad races cultivate for me!"

He alone did not have the time to perfect each power of laws. It was too troublesome, too exhausting, and too time-consuming.

Let the myriad races help him cultivate!

Once they perfected their illusory paths, he would reclaim them one by one.

The Phoenix Realm was just the beginning. Su Yu planned to implement this strategy across other realms as well. As long as these beings cultivated, they were helping him perfect his paths. Once his book pages merged with their paths, they would become puppets, eventually drained by Su Yu!

The possibility of backlash existed, but every action carried risks. Even simple suppression could lead to backlash.

This approach offered a higher cost-effectiveness.

Hearing Su Yu's explanation, the South Heavenly King, addressed as Master’s wife, had no more objections. The others, too, followed Su Yu's lead without question.

Su Yu did not immediately attack the Ape Realm. He had other matters to attend to. Managing so many captives was taxing, so he decided to first escort the Phoenix Emperor and others to the Iron Devourer Realm.

...

Su Yu swiftly left the Celestial River of Death.

Some time later, in the Iron Devourer Realm.

Within the grand palace of the Iron Devourer Race, June was in high spirits. Suddenly, his eyes shifted, and his large black circles transformed. He laughed, "Emperor Yu, you've arrived. Why didn't you inform me in advance? I could have welcomed you!"

Su Yu descended from the sky, smiling. "Congratulations! September, you've actually reached the Daofuse Realm. Congratulations!"

September grinned sheepishly. "I owe it all to Emperor Yu. Without your help and the care of our ancestors, I wouldn't have advanced so quickly."

Indeed, September had finally reached the Daofuse Realm. The Iron Devourer Race now had a second Daofuse Realm expert.

Su Yu chuckled, "It's your own fortune!"

June also laughed heartily, "It's the blessing brought by Emperor Yu. Now that September has advanced, I've decided to pass the throne of the Beast Emperor to him. I will focus on cultivation and prepare for the battle in the Upper Realm!"

"There's no rush."

Su Yu smiled, "I've come to ask for your help with something."

"Emperor Yu, just say the word!"

June was exceedingly polite. This generation's Human Lord was incredibly skilled, conquering the myriad realms effortlessly. The key was that everyone gained benefits without suffering losses, which was quite satisfying!

Su Yu said, "I need you to suppress some individuals. It's more about overseeing them. If you pass the throne to September, and since there are no battles recently, you could help me oversee them."

"Oversee?"

June was puzzled. "Who needs overseeing?"

Su Yu didn't elaborate. With a wave of his hand, over a dozen Eternal experts and one Daofuse expert appeared. Their bodies quickly recovered, but they were weak, and their auras were suppressed.

Eternals had been reduced to the Sunmoon Realm, and the Daofuse expert to the Eternal Realm.

June and September's eyes widened, their black circles expanding in shock.

What the hell!

Was that the Phoenix Emperor?

Wasn't the realm sealed? How did they capture them all?

June's mouth hung open, and after a long pause, he stammered, "Ph... Phoenix Emperor?"

In the grand hall, the Phoenix Emperor, now much calmer, sighed softly, a hint of bitterness in his voice. "Greetings, Brother June. In the future... please take care of us."

Su Yu calmly said, "Just oversee them! I've taken the Phoenix Realm, but I want to give them a chance, avoiding further slaughter. So, I'll suppress them in the Iron Devourer Realm. June, I'll need your help!"

June was a bit dazed but quickly nodded, "No problem! Here, they are suppressed, and overseeing them won't be difficult. Should I seal their Sea of Will?"

"No need!"

Su Yu chuckled, "If you're free, chat with the Phoenix Emperor, have some tea. You're old acquaintances, no need for such measures. If they behave, that's fine. If not... then kill them!"

Su Yu added, "I have other matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave..."

He hesitated for a moment, "You should still have some Councilor Tokens. I need them now and can exchange them for treasures..."

Before he finished, June took out two Councilor Tokens. "These? I have no use for them. If Emperor Yu needs them, take them! No need for treasures. September reaching the Daofuse Realm is the greatest blessing!"

Su Yu smiled, "Thank you!"

He accepted the tokens without hesitation, adding a few more to his collection.

Before leaving, Su Yu looked at September, "There are no battles now, but don't slack off. You have the potential to become a master of laws!"

With those words, Su Yu vanished into thin air.

Once he left, June and September stared wide-eyed at the Phoenix Clan members in the hall.

After a while, September chuckled, "Ancestor, the Phoenix Realm has been conquered!"

June was equally shocked, nodding, "It seems that apart from the gods, demons, and immortals, the other realms will likely meet the same fate! Emperor Yu is indeed wise, taking the Phoenix Realm without any effort!"

He laughed, looking at the Phoenix Emperor, "Everyone, please cultivate well here. Don't wander off, or... if we accidentally kill some of you, we won't be sorry!"

In the Iron Devourer Realm, these individuals couldn't stir up trouble!

The Phoenix Emperor sighed inwardly, saying nothing.

So be it!

Their misfortune was shared by the Ape Race and others, who wouldn't fare any better!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu quickly returned to the Celestial River of Death.

The next stop, the Ape Realm!

...

In the Ape Realm.

The Ape Emperor had yet to recover from his injuries. Unlike the Phoenix Emperor, he hadn't gathered his followers for a discussion.

However, he felt uneasy during his healing process, forcing him to stop and exit his meditation.

Regret filled his heart. Had he known, he wouldn't have stepped out to fight the humans, leading to his current severe injuries and the forced closure of his realm.

Sighing, the Ape Emperor left his cultivation chamber, feeling restless.

Outside, one of his Eternal descendants cautiously asked, "Ancestor, have you recovered?"

"No, not so quickly."

The Ape Emperor had been injured in two battles, and the accumulated injuries were not easy to heal. He sighed, "Surviving is already fortunate! In two battles, eleven Daofuse experts died. Surviving is a stroke of luck!"

Sighing again, the Ape Emperor looked around and asked, "Since sealing the realm, is everything stable?"

"Relatively stable, as long as you're here. But... there's some concern about the humans breaking through!"

The Ape Emperor nodded, helpless.

Soon, he noticed something, frowning slightly. "What's happening over there? I sense fluctuations. Is someone fighting?"

His descendant looked in that direction, outside the palace, and after a while, shook his head. "Not sure, maybe some unrest caused a conflict? I'll go check..."

The Ape Emperor didn't say much, extending his willpower to investigate the commotion.

Before he could probe further, his expression changed—death energy?

How could there be death energy!

"Ape Emperor, silence is your only chance for survival..."

The Ape Emperor was momentarily dazed, then Su Yu's voice echoed in his ears, "Trust us, we're here to save the Ape Race!"

The Ape Emperor's face changed drastically!

"Not good!"

With a shout, Su Yu cursed under his breath, "Disobedient, destroy all the Ape Race experts' bodies, leave none!"

Boom!

A massive explosion erupted, the sky and earth shattered, and dozens of immensely powerful experts charged out!

The Ape Emperor's strength was on par with the Phoenix Emperor, but his injuries were severe.

Although Su Yu and his team didn't appear right under his nose, they weren't far away.

With the Great Zhou King, a master of control, the outcome was no different from the Phoenix Emperor's. Apart from shouting "Not good," the Ape Emperor had no chance to resist.

"Hold on, stay calm, don't move!"

The Great Zhou King also shouted, "What are you doing! Underestimating me?"

Elsewhere, battles erupted, angry shouts echoed, but soon fell silent. Su Yu's team, using the same old tactics, quickly subdued the Ape Emperor!

...

Moments later, the same routine!

No different from the Phoenix Realm, leaving an Eternal from the Ape Realm to manage it.

However, more casualties occurred in the Ape Realm, though they were mostly at the Sunmoon level, not a major issue.

For the guardians, Di Dang and Huang Ji came to oversee, while the Human Realm sent three Eternals, including the Great Shang King, to suppress. Familiar procedures, same routine.

Su Yu also split the page belonging to the Ape Realm, integrating it into the paths of the Ape Race experts.

...

The Ape Realm's captives were escorted by Su Yu to the Hou Race for supervision.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor was capable of overseeing these individuals. Su Yu's only concern was that the Hou Pseudo Emperor might eat them, so he repeatedly warned him, until the Hou Pseudo Emperor almost cried, promising not to eat them!

You don't trust me!

Besides, the Ape Race isn't tasty, unless you eat their brains, but the Ape Emperor wouldn't dare.

According to Su Yu's plan, the Phoenix Clan was imprisoned in the Iron Devourer Realm, the Ape Clan in the Hou Realm, and soon the Kunpeng and Dragon Clans might also be captured. Such a terrifying prospect frightened the Ape Emperor, who dared not consume those sent by Su Yu.

...

The third stop, the Kunpeng Realm.

Chapter 710: Conquest of the Four Realms

In this race, the number of Eternals was not as many as the other two races, making it incredibly easy to conquer. The Kunpeng Half-Emperor's strength was mediocre, and capturing him was not more difficult than dealing with the other two realms.

Three battles, three victories. Su Yu had completely conquered three realms.

The Kunpeng Half-Emperor was also captured and sent to be suppressed by the Space Ancient Beast Race.

Thus, Su Yu's goal of conquering the four major realms was nearly complete, with three realms successfully subdued.

Only the Dragon Realm remained, and Su Yu exercised extra caution.

The strength of the Heavenly Dragon Marquis was greater than the other three, and Su Yu was worried about potential issues. Before leaving, he returned to the Human Realm and brought along Wan Tiansheng. To ensure absolute success, Su Yu not only brought Wan Tiansheng but also repeatedly instructed Old Turtle. If the Heavenly Dragon Marquis proved difficult to subdue, they were to banish him to the Death Realm.

If, after all this, they still couldn't succeed, Su Yu would have to rely on the Great Ming King to contain any disturbances from outside.

...

Dragon Realm.

The number of Eternals among the Dragon Race was now quite limited. In several great battles, the Dragon Race had contributed significantly. With the Dragon Emperor's death, they had sealed their realm once before, and now they were sealing it again.

Currently, apart from the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, there were only seven or eight Eternals left in the entire Dragon Race.

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis had been severely injured by the Great Zhou King last time, and today, like the other Half-Emperors, he was extremely uneasy.

His unease was mirrored by a small dragon outside the Dragon Palace.

It felt like things were about to go awry!

The small dragon was a clone of Lantian, and he felt like he was about to be exposed. The reason? The large seal he had buried near the Dragon Palace seemed to have been detected by the Heavenly Dragon Marquis.

Trouble!

Could this really be the end?

Lantian thought to himself. The next moment, seeing the Heavenly Dragon Marquis flying towards the place where he had buried the seal, Lantian grimaced. Was he really going to be exposed? This couldn't happen!

Su Yu and the others hadn't activated the seal yet!

Just as the Heavenly Dragon Marquis was about to investigate, a sudden roar erupted outside the Dragon Palace.

"Why can't we ally with the Human Race?"

Lantian roared, sweeping away a weak Shanhai giant dragon with his tail, shouting, "I demand to see the Heavenly Dragon Marquis!"

"Our Dragon Race has cooperated with the Human Race before!"

"The Great Xia Cultural Research Academy, the Great Ming Prefecture, both have members of our Dragon Race! I want to be an envoy to the Human Race. How many of our strong have died fighting against them? I don't want to see the Dragon Race perish. I demand to see the Heavenly Dragon Marquis. I want to negotiate with the Human Race!"

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis frowned. Negotiate?

This small Sunmoon giant dragon dared to suggest the Dragon Race surrender and negotiate!

At this moment, several Eternal dragons appeared, each looking at the giant dragon outside the hall. It was a Sunmoon Realm giant dragon.

At this moment, it was proposing to be an envoy to the Human Race and negotiate.

Everyone was taken aback.

Negotiate?

Surrender to the Human Race?

Many Dragon Race experts looked towards the Heavenly Dragon Marquis, who coldly said, "Negotiate? Ridiculous! Our Dragon Race is powerful in the Upper Realm. How dare a mere Sunmoon speak of such matters!"

He had no choice but to address this. Even though it was just a Sunmoon dragon, he feared it might incite similar thoughts among others in the Dragon Race.

At this moment, perhaps even the Eternal dragons harbored such thoughts.

Simply killing it wouldn't solve the problem.

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis had initially wanted to investigate the fluctuations he had just detected, but now he couldn't afford to. If he didn't address this, there would be internal chaos in the Dragon Realm.

Lantian, seeing the Heavenly Dragon Marquis flying towards him, felt a bit relieved and roared, "Heavenly Dragon Marquis, the survival of our race is the responsibility of every dragon! This is not just your decision... If you refuse to negotiate, then I will use my blood to awaken the Dragon Race!"

With those words, he began to burn his dragon body, lamenting, "With my blood, I plead to my kin, burning my body..."

At this moment, an Eternal dragon shouted, "Stop this madness! The Heavenly Dragon Marquis will discuss this with everyone. Don't do anything foolish!"

A group of dragons was drawn to Lantian's dramatic display.

Such a bold dragon!

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis hadn't even refused to negotiate, and yet this dragon was ready to commit suicide. This... was truly bold!

The Heavenly Dragon Marquis was also helpless!

Damn it!

What kind of person was this?

Ready to die just like that?

If this dragon really died, there would surely be voices of dissent in the Dragon Realm. Although he wasn't afraid, internal strife was never good. He had no choice but to quickly say, "No, this Marquis was just..."

Boom!

At that moment, Su Yu and his group finally activated the seal. The Heavenly Dragon Marquis instinctively looked back, while in front, Lantian's voice drowned out everything else, "I don't believe it, I'm committing suicide! The Dragon Race wants peace!"

Boom!

The sound of self-destruction echoed, completely overshadowing the sound of the realm being opened.

Many dragons didn't even have time to react before seven or eight large hands struck towards the Heavenly Dragon Marquis!

...

By the time the Heavenly Dragon Marquis's physical body was destroyed and his sea of will was kicked into the Death Realm by Su Yu, where Old Turtle suppressed him, those outside the Dragon Realm still didn't know what had happened.

They only knew that a Sunmoon dragon had self-destructed!

Su Yu, having roughly understood the situation, couldn't help but laugh.

Lantian... fortunately!

They were almost discovered by the enemy in advance. If Lantian had been stronger, he could have stirred up a storm all by himself.

Fortunately, he noticed in time and caused a commotion, allowing Su Yu and his group to successfully take the Dragon Realm.

Thus, all four major realms were successfully conquered.

Although there was a slight hiccup in the Dragon Realm, it was merely the loss of one of Lantian's clones, which was insignificant.

At the cost of one of Lantian's clones, Su Yu successfully conquered the four major realms.

At this point, the threat from the lower realms was almost completely neutralized.

The God, Demon, and Immortal races were left without allies!

Once the Heavenly Overseer Marquis and Duobao were dealt with, Su Yu could temporarily leave the lower realms alone.
