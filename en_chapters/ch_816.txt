Chapter 816: Conspiracy (Subscription Requested)

Su Yu's side revealed their strength!

It was formidable!

Thirteen Heavenly Venerables, plus Su Yu himself, several top-tier Heavenly Kings like Tianhuo, Lanshan, and Doubao, and other Heavenly Kings such as Jiuyue, Flatbread, Fate Emperor, Lie Kong, and Tian Ce.

Lie Kong hailed from the Space Ancient Beast Race, the Dao companion of the Space Beast Emperor.

Tian Ce was previously the leader of the Fate Clan in the Upper Realm.

As for Hou Pseudo Emperor, Space Beast Emperor, April, June, Topsoil Spirit, Great Qin King, and Great Xia King...

Those who had integrated into Su Yu's world were all at the Heavenly King level within it, while those who hadn't were still capable of second-tier Daofuse combat power.

Hetu, Xia Chen, and other resurrected necromancers were similar, and the likes of Great Ming King were also second-tier existences.

Apart from some newly ascended Daofuse who were slightly weaker, even Heavendoom and others possessed Heavenly King or second-tier combat power within the world.

Previously, Su Yu's side had dispatched 50 Daofuse. Now, with over 20 resurrected necromancers joining, along with the Upper Realm Fate Clan, Space Ancient Beast Race, and Hou Race Daofuse, the number of Daofuse had reached nearly a hundred!

And this wasn't even the full extent!

How could the myriad races not despair at such strength?

The Human Race was growing stronger, while they were weakening. Su Yu's goal was to win without fighting!

...

Would anyone else come?

On the sixth day, the South Heavenly King and over twenty Daofuse arrived. Would anyone appear on the seventh day?

The Martial Emperor?

Or Su Yu?

At this moment, apart from these two, Su Yu's side shouldn't have any more powerful figures.

...

But there were still more!

On the seventh day.

Suddenly, deathly aura surged into the heavens!

On this day, Su Yu opened the Death Realm, and the deathly aura surged into the heavens.

The Undead Emperor actually didn't want to emerge.

But... he couldn't resist Su Yu's persuasion.

Su Yu said he wanted to show his strength, to reveal all his cards... This was Su Yu's claim, but whether it was truly all his cards, no one knew.

Let's assume it was!

Necromancers appearing in the realm of the living could easily trigger the punishment of the rules... But now, in the Myriad Realms, the rules had been dispersed by Su Yu, devoured, and the rule paths had been broken by him. What punishment could there be?

On this day, in the Human Realm.

Hundred Battle King’s eyes narrowed!

Beside him, Changqing and Changmei stood by, and Changqing said in a deep voice, "Another one has appeared!"

And... not an ordinary one!

"The Undead Emperor!"

Hundred Battle King knew who this was, with some gravity, "In the Death Realm, perhaps only he has truly reached the realm of the ruler of laws!"

The Undead Emperor had actually appeared!

What exactly was Su Yu trying to do?

No, or rather, who was Su Yu trying to intimidate?

Me?

If not, the power Su Yu had previously deployed was already sufficient, yet at this moment, he still mobilized the necromancer army!

Yes, it wasn't just the Undead Emperor. At this moment, the Undead Emperor, leading over ten necromancer Daofuse, shattered the void and flew towards the Soul Burying Mountain passage.

"Is this his entire foundation?"

Hundred Battle King murmured, "Very strong!"

A ruler of laws, no, with the Martial Emperor, there were two!

Two rulers of laws, thirteen Heavenly Venerables, not counting Su Yu himself, over a hundred Daofuse, a batch of Heavenly Kings—was this Su Yu's confidence?

Very substantial!

Hundred Battle King hadn't expected, hadn't anticipated, that Su Yu would accumulate such formidable strength in such a short time, shocking and terrifying.

Beside him, Changqing said in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, Su Yu... is probably trying to intimidate Your Majesty!"

All the powerful figures hadn't crossed through chaos, except for the two from the Chaos Ancient Clan. The rest had all come from the Myriad Realms, each one bursting with aura in the outside world, shaking the heavens and earth. Su Yu hadn't secretly sent his subordinates to appear on the battlefield.

Instead, for seven consecutive days, powerful figures continuously emerged.

Today, even the Undead Emperor had come out!

This was the truly terrifying thing!

Hundred Battle King closed his eyes, quickly opened them, and nodded, "He is indeed trying to intimidate me!"

Su Yu was very arrogant, but he had the capital to be arrogant. He was warning Hundred Battle King not to make any wrong choices. Otherwise, with the current strength under Su Yu's command, terrifyingly powerful, according to the current situation, it might appear that even two sides joining forces would struggle to match Su Yu's side.

It might even require three sides joining forces to fight against Su Yu's side!

Su Yu... the one with the shallowest foundation, yet, at this point, had become the strongest side!

...

Upper Realm.

When the deathly aura surged into the heavens, everyone realized that trouble had arrived.

"Emperor Yu's Mansion, the Necromancer King is going to battle!"

In the distance, in the void, a formidable existence, with an aura that shook the heavens and earth, followed by over ten Daofuse necromancers. Those Daofuse necromancers appeared weak in comparison to him.

This was the seventh day!

A ruler of laws personally appeared.

The Undead Emperor stepped through the void, deathly aura sweeping the heavens and earth. The Undead Emperor was thin, wearing a robe, crowned with a crown, the mark of a Necromancer King. He walked step by step, smiling, "By the order of His Majesty, this king is responsible for guiding the fallen generals of Emperor Yu's Mansion!"

Even the Necromancer King had appeared!

At this moment, the myriad races were utterly in despair!

"A ruler of laws!"

"And there's also the Martial Emperor!"

"What are we fighting for?"

"Even the Divine Empress might not be able to match this Necromancer King... How can we fight?"

Everyone was truly in despair!

If the Divine Empress got entangled with the Necromancer King, how could the other nine Heavenly Venerables match Su Yu's side?

It must be known that Su Yu's side had several top-tier Heavenly Venerables!

Despair, pessimism, various emotions boiled over the Human Mountain.

...

On the Human Mountain.

When seeing the Necromancer King appear, Tiangu was utterly dejected, with some confusion and loss, he softly said, "War... only... extermination!"

War?

The Martial Emperor hadn't even come yet!

What would the result be when the Martial Emperor arrived?

The Martial Emperor had gone deep into chaos, perhaps to find Zhou Ji, or maybe just wandering, but regardless, this figure existed, had broken the seal, and once he appeared, let alone the myriad races, even if the myriad races united with the Sin Clan, Su Yu's side could suppress them!

Too terrifying!

The number of Daofuse was actually only on par with Su Yu's side, but the key was the large number of pseudo-dao experts. Once the war started, they might even have fewer Daofuse than Su Yu's side.

This... was completely unplayable.

At this moment, only by three sides joining forces could there be hope of fighting Su Yu's side!

The Undead Emperor stepped through the void, smiling, "His Majesty will arrive soon! His Majesty set a three-month period, perhaps the total attack won't be advanced!"

With those words, the Undead Emperor looked towards Wu Ji and the others, smiling, "His Majesty asked me to inquire, once the war starts, can you six block the Sin Clan's reinforcements? Why doesn't Hundred Battle King come to fight? Or do you think you can block them?"

On the Control King's side, there were only six Heavenly Venerables.

Not many!

Of course, there were many Heavenly Kings and Daofuse, Yue Zhan, Mo Tianzun, perhaps they could be left to the Heavenly Kings and those Daofuse to fight, but could the six Heavenly Venerables match two rulers of laws?

The hope was slim!

At this moment, Wu Ji's face was heavy. Was it time to fight?

Would His Majesty come?

If His Majesty didn't come, they couldn't match the Control King's faction.

But if Su Yu hadn't appeared, and His Majesty came first, would it be a loss of face?

But at this time, their side's strength was indeed inferior to Su Yu's side, unable to suppress. Once during the war, if the Control King's faction really reinforced the myriad races, it would be even more humiliating!

At this time, when a ruler of laws came to inquire, Wu Ji didn't dare to neglect, saying in a deep voice, "Rest assured, if a war truly breaks out, we will intercept them!"

The Undead Emperor continued, "Can the Hundred Battle King lineage only intercept, and not annihilate?"

The Undead Emperor smiled faintly, "Emperor Yu, weak in strength, unable to match a ruler of laws, so whether he comes or not, it doesn't matter! His Majesty's intention is that he can sit at the core, as long as nothing happens to him, our spiritual belief remains! But the Hundred Battle King is your strongest, if he doesn't come, can you really intercept?"

With these words, some people's hearts suddenly stirred.

What?

Right!

Su Yu!

Core!

At this moment, it seemed like something flashed in everyone's minds, Su Yu!

Su Yu alone!

Where was he?

In the Death Realm?

With the Martial Emperor?

What if the Martial Emperor wasn't there?

And was in chaos... then... then Su Yu was really alone, his subordinates, rulers of laws, Heavenly Venerables, Heavenly Kings, Daofuse... could be said to have all come out.

At this moment, if someone said Su Yu had a large number of strong subordinates, no one would believe it. If he did, Su Yu would have unified the Myriad Realms long ago!

Su Yu... alone!

...

At this moment, Tiangu, Divine Empress, Control Qing, Wu Ji...

Many people, their minds suddenly trembled like lightning.

Su Yu, he was alone.

He was the core, Su Yu's side was too mixed, with people from all races, strong figures from all races, even necromancers, once Su Yu was killed, perhaps Su Yu's side would collapse on its own.

Besides Su Yu, who else could suppress all sides?

If Su Yu died, would the Undead Emperor listen to others?

Would Fat Ball care about others?

Would Tianming and the others still obey orders?

None would!

Including Consort Qi, Tianhuo, these people would probably retreat, March, Giant Axe, these people, who would they listen to?

At this moment, countless people trembled in their hearts.

The Undead Emperor's words suddenly made them realize a serious problem.

...

On the Human Race side.

Great Zhou King and others slightly changed color.

Yes, why hadn't Su Yu come yet?

The plan to intimidate the myriad races was almost complete.

At this moment, if Su Yu brought the personnel from various races in the lower realm, the myriad races would surely compromise, and once they did... the Human Race united with the myriad races would surely win!

Fighting the Hundred Battle King side and the Sin Clan side would be no difficulty.

Great Zhou King quickly looked at the Undead Emperor, the Undead Emperor's words seemed to have a hint, as if telling everyone, Su Yu was now alone, if someone wanted to kill him, they could go kill him!

He was strong, but he was only a Heavenly Venerable.

Others couldn't go, but... Hundred Battle King could!

Now, Hundred Battle King hadn't appeared yet.

Go kill Su Yu!

Kill Su Yu, and Su Yu's side would surely collapse.

...

On Wu Ji's side.

Wu Ji suddenly felt a shiver, transmitting to a few people, with fear, "His Majesty... won't go against Su Yu, right?"

His Majesty didn't support Su Yu's plan!

In a moment of desperation, he agreed to suppress the Sin Clan. But now... would His Majesty take a reckless gamble, seizing the opportunity while Su Yu's forces were in the Upper Realm, to enter the Death Realm and kill Su Yu?

Hundred Battle King could enter. He could even go through Chaos! Even if he didn't, he might have other ways to enter. Even if they fought fiercely in the Death Realm, separated by the lower realm, others might not know or be able to rescue in time.

Upon hearing this, the group was shaken. Blood Shadow quickly transmitted, "Impossible... Even if His Majesty is at odds with the Human Lord Su, he wouldn't do something so foolish... It's impossible!"

He dared not think about it! It couldn't be! But... what if?

Su Yu is now the core of the alliance with the powerful forces of the Emperor Yu's Mansion. If His Majesty truly killed Su Yu, the consequences would be unimaginable. The entire situation across the Myriad Realms would change instantly!

Currently, the Human Race suppresses the myriad races and the Sin Clan. If Su Yu were to die, even if they could still fight, the advantage would be lost in an instant.

Red Moon also quickly added, "His Majesty wouldn't be so unwise. Killing the Tenth Human Lord... that would be defying the heavens, betraying the Human Race... It's impossible..."

They dared not think about it, dared not believe it!

Suddenly, Thunderstorm spoke, "Why is Su Yu... staying alone in the Death Realm?"

Is Su Yu an idiot? He isn't! Su Yu is sharper than anyone. When the Undead Emperor mentioned this, many strong individuals immediately realized the crisis. Did Su Yu himself not understand?

Thunderstorm didn't believe it! He trembled, not because of Su Yu, but because of Hundred Battle King: "Su Yu... he... he wants to force His Majesty to betray the Human Race... to kill His Majesty!"

These words made everyone's heads explode! Wu Ji could hardly imagine it! His mind was filled with Thunderstorm's words: Su Yu wants to force Hundred Battle King to act, to make him betray the Human Race!

Heavens! Is he mad?

Wu Ji's body trembled, his voice shaking with fear, "Impossible... His Majesty wouldn't do such a thing. Maybe their ideals differ, but killing Su Yu... that's different. Su Yu is suppressing the myriad races and the Sin Clan. If His Majesty kills Su Yu... that... that won't happen... it won't..."

Suddenly, he looked towards the Great Zhou King and the others, with a hint of panic, transmitting angrily, "Go back!"

If Su Yu doesn't come, some of these people must return!

He was afraid! Afraid that His Majesty, seeing an opportunity, might truly act. At that time... where would they go?

They couldn't let the situation deteriorate like this!

Wu Ji and the others were scared because they knew that Hundred Battle King was not indecisive. In fact, he was more decisive than anyone. If he truly had this thought and saw an opportunity, he might indeed do it!

Moreover, with Changqing and Changmei, those two lackeys, they might even encourage His Majesty to act!

At this moment, Wu Ji wished he could rush to the lower realm and tell Hundred Battle King not to do it, that it was a trap!

Killing Su Yu would mean His Majesty severing ties with the Human Race!

Even if he abandoned the Human Race in the past, it was out of necessity. But to kill Su Yu now would be completely different. From then on, there would be no turning back!

...

At this moment, among the Great Zhou King and others, some were worried, some were heavy-hearted, and some were terrified.

They all looked towards the Undead Emperor.

Previously, no one had thought deeply about it. But when the Undead Emperor spoke, everyone considered the danger Su Yu was in.

Someone suddenly said, "It's fine... His Majesty... over there... it should be fine!"

His Majesty should be in his own world, right?

According to His Majesty, even if Hundred Battle King entered, he wouldn't be afraid.

Yes! That's it, no problem.

"Lantian, contact His Majesty..."

Lantian suddenly opened his eyes, "His Majesty... seems to be in the Death Realm!"

Yes, Su Yu seems to be in the Death Realm. The Death Realm is sealed, and separated by the boundary, Lantian cannot sense his own avatar. If Su Yu were in Chaos, he could sense something.

So... His Majesty is not in his world!

Upon hearing this, everyone changed color.

"The Death Realm is sealed. Hundred Battle King can't enter, right?"

Everyone was silent, unsure.

Why didn't His Majesty come?

Was it really just for safety?

But now, it seems even more unsafe.

The entire world fell silent for a moment.

...

Above the Human Mountain.

Tiangu's eyes suddenly shone brightly!

"Su Yu and Hundred Battle King..."

Tiangu's eyes were incredibly bright, "They... might erupt into conflict ahead of time!"

The Divine Empress's eyes suddenly gleamed, "Are you saying... Hundred Battle King might take the opportunity to act against him?"

"Yes!"

Tiangu said in a deep voice, "No, this is a situation Su Yu deliberately created! Unless... he is with the Martial Emperor, and the Martial Emperor is by his side?"

If so, that would explain it.

If the Martial Emperor isn't there... then it's a huge opportunity!

Tiangu's eyes flickered, "If Su Yu... truly dies... our myriad races... fear no one!"

Will Su Yu die?

The situation had become suddenly confusing, and it was all caused by Su Yu himself, which was simply unbelievable.

What is this madman Su Yu doing?

Clearly holding an absolute advantage, does he still want to take down all three sides in one battle?

At this moment, Dao Heavenly Venerable's face also changed slightly, "If a real fight breaks out, and others go to rescue... should we stop them or not?"

If they really start fighting, there might be commotion, and others will definitely go to rescue. Should they stop them or not?

As he was thinking, suddenly, a rumbling sound erupted!

In the next moment, under the shocked gazes of everyone, continuous rumbling sounds came from the direction of the Soul Burying Mountain and the Dao Source Land. In the blink of an eye, the two passages leading to the lower realm seemed to be sealed.

Instantly, the entire Upper Realm was in chaos!

Sealed?

Since Su Yu broke the passage, the power of laws dissipated. In theory, this passage couldn't be sealed unless the power of laws was restored.

To seal it... special means must be used!

Who did this?

Su Yu?

Hundred Battle King?

...

At this moment, in front of the Gate of Hell.

Prison Green suddenly stood up, looking towards the two places, muttering, "Sealed..."

She suddenly looked at the Bro Dragon Beast!

The lower realm was sealed!

Going through Chaos is possible, but it's much more troublesome, taking at least half a day to cross Chaos, and that's if nothing goes wrong.

So, can we go out and slaughter now?

Kill Wu Ji and the others!

Then bring out the Ruler of Laws!

Is it Su Yu's plan?

Or what?

At this moment, Prison Green also trembled slightly. It seemed like an opportunity, but also like a danger.

Is it a crisis or an opportunity?

The Bro Dragon Beast also trembled slightly, and after a long time, said in a low voice, "Wait!"

Wait for what?

Wait for the great battle!

Wait for the battle between Su Yu and Hundred Battle King. If there is indeed a battle, then act, kill Wu Ji and the others!

If not... be careful of these two sides playing a double act, deliberately luring them out, away from the vicinity of the Gate of Hell. Once far away, killing the Heavenly Venerable without being able to use them as materials to bring out the Ruler of Laws would be pointless, and they might instead be surrounded and killed.

Is it a scheme, or has the Human Race truly fallen into internal strife?

No one could judge!

...

At this moment, on Su Yu's side, the South Heavenly King also changed color, "Go through Chaos, to the lower realm!"

The Great Zhou King was heavy-hearted, suddenly shouting, "We can't go! We mustn't go!"

He looked around, "Stay calm!"

He said in a deep voice, "His Majesty won't act rashly. Now, with us here, united with Wu Ji and the others, we can suppress both sides. But if some of us leave... do you want to bury everyone?"

He was trying to understand Su Yu's intentions.

This time, Su Yu didn't say anything.

Is he letting me choose?

On their side, along with Wu Ji's side, they could currently match both sides. But if some of them left, it would be troublesome. If the Sin Clan attacked, if the myriad races attacked... the previous advantage would vanish instantly!

They had finally forced the myriad races to this point!

If they withdrew now, all the previous preparations would be in vain!

Stay calm!

The Great Zhou King thought about this, shouting, "Continue the battle of generals!"

He looked towards the direction of the myriad races, his voice eerie, "What are you looking at, Tiangu, aren't you going to fight? Then, this is the total attack!"

Tiangu also took a deep look at the Great Zhou King, saying faintly, "Are you sure you want to continue?"

The Great Zhou King sneered, "His Majesty has his own calculations, Tiangu, do you think His Majesty would be as foolish as you?"

Tiangu wasn't angry, after a while, he said, "I'm just afraid that he sweeps the world, overly arrogant!"

Tiangu said faintly, "Does he really think he alone can suppress all three sides?"

Is Su Yu too arrogant?

As soon as he finished speaking, in the distance, Wu Ji's roar came, filled with anger, "Nonsense! It's all a conspiracy! His Majesty won't conflict with the Tenth Human Lord, even if their ideals differ, there won't be conflict!"

The Great Zhou King suddenly looked over there, with some uncertainty, saying in a deep voice, "We also believe Hundred Battle King won't... but... if it truly happens... what will you choose?"

Is Su Yu doing this for these people?

Forcing Hundred Battle King to rebel!

Has Su Yu seen something, that most of Hundred Battle King's people in the Upper Realm still lean towards the Human Race, not necessarily towards Su Yu? Su Yu doesn't represent the Human Race, nor does Hundred Battle King.

Some people just follow those who can save the Human Race.

Could it be that Su Yu is doing it for them?

At this moment, the separation of the upper and lower realms, if Hundred Battle King truly goes to kill Su Yu... the people of Hundred Battle King in the Upper Realm might collapse.

Wu Ji's face changed, gritting his teeth, angrily saying, "I said, His Majesty wouldn't do that!"

He wouldn't!

Hundred Battle King is also the faith of some people!

Hundred Battle King, the Human Race, if Hundred Battle King truly goes to kill Su Yu, what choice should be made?

This is an extremely collapsing and unthinkable problem for them.

As they watched Su Yu steadily pressuring the myriad races, they felt a mix of shock and delight. It was reassuring that Su Yu's side was strong enough to suppress the myriad races. Although there might be conflicts with the Hundred Battle King, those issues hadn't surfaced yet.

But what if the Hundred Battle King disrupted this balance? What would they do then?

At this moment, the Great Zhou King seemed to understand Su Yu's intentions. He took a deep breath, his eyes cold and sharp. "Anything is possible! Why was the passage to the lower realm suddenly sealed? Who could have done it?"

"His Majesty has already dispersed the rules, unless... someone incredibly powerful manipulated the power of laws to seal the lower realm!"

He spoke coldly, "Why seal the lower realm? What are they afraid of?"

"It's... it's the Martial Emperor!" Suddenly, Wu Ji shouted, "It's him, yes, it's him! He's also very powerful. Maybe he also wants to... to target Su Yu, yes, that's it. Last time, he even wanted to join forces with His Majesty to kill Su Yu!"

Some things were best left unthought. Otherwise, they could lead to big trouble.

The Martial Emperor? At this moment, Wu Ji could only consider the Martial Emperor's actions as the best-case scenario. If it wasn't the Martial Emperor, then it was the worst-case scenario.

Just then, a figure suddenly appeared in the distant chaos. The Martial Emperor, clad in golden armor, cursed, "What the hell, here one moment, there the next..."

In the next instant, he was startled, "Damn, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you, you brat? If I catch you, I'll beat you to death!"

Boom!

A powerful aura instantly shook the heavens and earth. The Martial Emperor broke through the void and vanished in an instant. His voice echoed with wild laughter, "That brat showed up, Zhou Ji, right? This time, I'm definitely going to kill him and see who's stronger!"

Wu Ji's face turned pale!

Zhou Ji!

Zhou Ji had appeared?

Had the Martial Emperor discovered him?

No, it seemed more like Zhou Ji was deliberately luring the Martial Emperor away!

Why would he do that?

Could it really be His Majesty's doing?

Impossible!

But the lower realm was sealed by the Martial Emperor, so that possibility was ruled out. In that case, only the Hundred Battle King had the strength to do it.

The Martial Emperor who just appeared must have been his true self!

Too powerful!

Therefore, the one who sealed the lower realm could not have been the Martial Emperor!

Then... it could only be the Hundred Battle King.

The Hundred Battle King had betrayed them!

Wu Ji was somewhat frantic. His Majesty had betrayed them. He really had... No, he couldn't jump to conclusions now. Maybe... maybe it was just an accident?

...

At this moment.

In the lower realm.

Su Yu looked up at the sky, a hint of emotion in his voice. "The lower realm is sealed now."

Not far away, the Hundred Battle King, wearing a crown and a golden robe, stood with a few others. His expression was calm, but his eyes were complex. He spoke softly, "Su Yu, are you plotting against me?"

Su Yu chuckled, "No, I'm just giving you a chance."

Su Yu laughed lightly, "I prefer to take the initiative rather than passively wait for the outcome. Whether you betray or not, the choice is yours, isn't it?"

Beside him, Changqing's face was ashen as he shouted angrily, "Su Yu, you... you did this on purpose! You're forcing His Majesty!"

Yes, the lower realm wasn't sealed by the Hundred Battle King. It was Su Yu himself!

He did it himself!

This terrifying guy was even stronger than expected. He sealed the two major passages himself, even surprising the Hundred Battle King!

Su Yu was terrifying to the extreme!

He did it on purpose!

Su Yu said calmly, "I'm not forcing you, Hundred Battle King. You can choose for yourself! Choose to kill me, or... choose to cooperate with me, truly cooperate! You've been waiting in the Human Realm, what are you waiting for? Waiting for Wu Ji and the others to be killed, for the Sin Clan to bring out a few rulers of laws?"

Su Yu said calmly, "You've been delaying going to the Upper Realm. What will happen if the Sin Clan makes a move? If my people weren't so numerous and strong, what then?"

"What you're afraid of is the Martial Emperor's interference... Are you in contact with Zhou Ji to lure the Martial Emperor away?"

"Don't worry, I have arrangements for the Martial Emperor. I've made him appear and leave on his own... just as you wanted! Of course, maybe Zhou Ji really did appear. If so, the Martial Emperor won't interfere... But my people are strong, the Sin Clan won't act rashly unless... you can take me down!"

Su Yu looked at him, smiling, "Have you been waiting for Zhou Ji? You're afraid the Martial Emperor will interfere with your plans, right?"

"But you didn't expect my people to be more numerous and stronger than you imagined!"

"Even without the Martial Emperor, they wouldn't dare act rashly... So, you have only one path, kill me to turn everything around, Hundred Battle King, what do you think?"

The Hundred Battle King's face darkened, "Su Yu, I never intended to be your enemy!"

"Yes, maybe."

Su Yu nodded slightly, "All you want is to complete your plan. As for being my enemy, that's probably not the result you want to see. You'd prefer everything to transition smoothly..."

Su Yu smiled, "Without my interference, no one could stop you from opening the Gate of Hell, right? Unfortunately... it seems I've disrupted your plan, Hundred Battle King, isn't that so?"

The Hundred Battle King sighed, "I didn't expect you to rise so quickly, nor did I expect... you would actively come to force me!"

He had a self-mocking look, "Su Yu, you're more terrifying and insidious than anyone imagined! Do you want to smoothly take over my people?"

He had a self-mocking look, "Now, everyone thinks I sealed the lower realm to kill you... Wu Ji and the others are probably already collapsing. Once you and I clash, the commotion will spread upwards... and you can easily take over my people, right?"

What a Su Yu!

Cunning, shameless, insidious!

No one would believe that Su Yu himself sealed the lower realm. They would only think it was the Hundred Battle King. There was no second person!

Su Yu said calmly, "I just don't want internal strife among the Human Race, right?"

Su Yu smiled faintly, "If you cooperate with me... then your people will still be yours! If you have no ulterior motives, everything will develop towards the best outcome!"

The Hundred Battle King laughed, "Maybe! Su Yu, I'm only curious about one thing, where do you get the confidence to match me?"

At this moment, his aura gradually emerged!

It surged to the stars!

Boundless power!

That powerful aura even shook the Myriad Realms!

The Hundred Battle King walked towards Su Yu step by step, with a cold expression, "I don't want to be your enemy. Even if you want to be the Human Lord, the Human Emperor, I can let you! As long as you don't interfere with me, I won't actively seek you out, Su Yu, why do you insist on forcing me?"

His aura was strong!

In almost an instant, it surpassed the Divine Empress of the past, even approaching the Martial Emperor. He carried a bit of unwillingness, a bit of anger, "I have never wronged the Human Race in the slightest!"

"I am also suppressing the myriad races, suppressing the Sin Clan... Why must you force me?"

At this moment, two Heavenly Venerables appeared behind the Hundred Battle King. Soon, nearly twenty Daofuse experts appeared, all very powerful.

These people quickly spread out around Su Yu.

The Hundred Battle King walked towards Su Yu step by step, "Su Yu, now... you still have a chance!"

The Hundred Battle King said in a deep voice, "As long as you don't interfere with me, I promise not to let the Sin Clan grow, nor will I let the myriad races affect the Myriad Realms... You can destroy the myriad races, I will even help you destroy them... But the Sin Clan, I still have use for them... Su Yu, in this way, you and I can be considered as cooperating... You go to rescue the Human Emperor and the others, I won't stop you, I'll do my thing, you do yours, how about it?"

Su Yu smiled, "I'm curious, why do you insist on opening the Gate of Hell? You say you won't let the Sin Clan grow... then tell me, if the Control King appears, can you deal with it?"

The Hundred Battle King said in a deep voice, "Of course, the Human Ancestor can handle everything!"

"Are you sure the Human Ancestor can handle everything?"

Su Yu laughed, "Where is the Human Ancestor? How strong is the Human Ancestor? What exactly does the Human Ancestor think... do you know?"

The Hundred Battle King shouted, "I know! Su Yu, I don't need you to remind me! You will never know how strong the enemies you will face are! The chaos behind the Gate of Hell, the era of opening the heavens behind the Heaven Gate, and... the chaos that may still exist before!"

He shouted, "Can you deal with them? Can the Human Emperor? The Human Emperor doesn't know anything..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "Then we can wait for the Human Emperor to return, and we can discuss opening the Gate of Hell together!"

The Hundred Battle King was somewhat angry, "I said, you don't understand! The Human Emperor is conservative, he won't agree to open the Gate of Hell and let chaos impact the heavens and earth! You don't understand the Human Emperor at all! His philosophy is different from yours, and different from mine... If you really understood the Human Emperor, you wouldn't think he would actively open the Gate of Hell! He would rather leave with the myriad races' experts than let the Human Ancestor return... He's different!"

Su Yu's face changed slightly, "You mean, the Human Emperor... actually knows about this!"

The Hundred Battle King was silent for a moment, then sneered, "Yes, he knows!"

Su Yu's heart trembled slightly!

The Human Emperor knew, but he didn't agree!

The Control King!

Su Yu's heart trembled again, "The Control King... it's related to the Control King... the Control King's betrayal... could it be... could it be that the Control King wanted to open the Gate of Hell, but everyone disagreed, right? The Culture King once punished the Control King... but it was just a minor punishment, even letting the Control King guard the Gate of Hell... which means at that time, everyone didn't think the Control King would betray... was it you... was it all of you?"

He was somewhat shaken, "So, you and the Control King, are actually in cahoots?"

At this moment, he seemed to have completely understood something.

Su Yu exclaimed in shock, "Your goal and the Control King's goal are both to fully open the Gate of Hell! And the Control King even ventured into the Gate of Hell willingly! You're not afraid of the Gate of Hell opening because the Control King is actually one of you, isn't he?"

At that moment, Su Yu fully understood, looking at him with astonishment. "So, whether it's Yue Luo or Yue Xiao, they're actually all part of your group?"

Su Yu furrowed his brows. "Then why, six thousand years ago, didn't you join forces to destroy the myriad races? That way, no one would have stopped you from opening the Gate of Hell. Why put on a show?"

Hundred Battle closed his eyes, seemingly in deep thought, or perhaps contemplating something. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and sighed softly, "You're very clever! As for not destroying the myriad races, you don't understand. If the myriad races were destroyed, those rulers of laws who were taken away would sense it!"

He spoke with a hint of emotion, "You really don't understand... Once the myriad races are destroyed, those people will return at all costs! Six thousand years ago, the Gate of Hell wasn't open this wide. If they returned quickly... everything would be over!"

Hundred Battle gave a self-deprecating smile. "The rulers of laws among the myriad races are more numerous and stronger than the Human Emperor and his people! But they're afraid of death, afraid of sacrifice, so they're waiting, enduring slowly, rather than launching a desperate attack to crush the Human Emperor and his people!"

"Su Yu, you still don't understand... Destroying the myriad races would only cause severe damage to the Human Emperor and his people! It might even lead to their annihilation!"

Su Yu's face turned icy. "Yet you said you were willing to help me destroy the myriad races because now the Gate of Hell can be opened! When I lead people to aid the Human Emperor, perhaps they will have already been defeated, and we might encounter powerful enemies from the myriad races on the way, sparking a great battle, just enough to delay us... Hundred Battle, is that your plan?"

Hundred Battle looked at him, sighing with emotion, "You're too smart!"

Su Yu often guessed many things from just a single sentence!

A terrifying fellow!

And at this moment, Su Yu fully understood, "Six thousand years ago, the Gate of Hell hadn't developed cracks, right? So back then, even if the myriad races were defeated, with no one to stop you, you still couldn't open the Gate of Hell! But now, you can!"

"According to the Human Emperor's calculations, perhaps in the last tide, six thousand years ago, the myriad races should have been defeated. The ninth generation Human Lord would lead people to rescue them, so during that tide, the Human Emperor's secret guards appeared... But then, a traitor like you emerged, taking control of the human race. This was something neither the Human Emperor nor the Torchbearer anticipated, right?"

"And at that time, if the myriad races were defeated and the rulers of laws sensed it, they would return swiftly... You simply didn't have the time to open the Gate of Hell, so you remained dormant?"

Su Yu coldly stated, "The Gate of Hell... To bring back the Human Ancestor, you've truly gone mad! Even at the cost of sacrificing the Human Emperor and his people, you are nothing but beasts!"

Hundred Battle silently watched him.

He said nothing, nor did he attempt to refute anything.

At this moment, Su Yu's aura gradually grew stronger, vaguely reaching the level of a Divine Emperor's consort, carrying a certain coldness. "So, when I led people to kill those from the Sin Clan, it must have pained you, didn't it?"

"Not really."

Hundred Battle replied calmly, "Dead is dead. If they don't die, how can we bring out Yu Qing and Po Long, how can we expand the cracks in the Gate of Hell? If they don't die, others will. I just didn't expect you to think of unifying the myriad realms so quickly!"

Su Yu's face turned cold as he looked at him, no longer smiling.

"So... you, Hundred Battle, are the greatest traitor!"

"No... I'm not a traitor!"

Hundred Battle shook his head. "I'm not, the Control King isn't, the Battle King isn't, none of us are... We just hope to take a different path, rather than passively waiting for destruction with the Human Emperor! Su Yu, it's a matter of choice, not betrayal!"

He spoke calmly, "If you think we're traitors... then the Culture King, Martial King, and Time Sage are too, because they also ventured into the Heaven Gate, leading to the collapse of the ancient imperial court! At least the Control King didn't choose to unseal the Gate of Hell during that period... It was the Culture King and the others who left first, causing the current situation! If you want to blame someone, blame the Culture King and Martial King for today's mess. Why don't you call them traitors?"

Su Yu thought for a moment, then suddenly laughed and nodded, "What you say seems to make some sense... but... it's utter nonsense!"

Su Yu shouted coldly, "Even if the Culture King and the others ventured into the Heaven Gate, leading to the ancient downfall, the Human Emperor still cleaned up after them, leaving behind many contingencies to ensure the human race wouldn't suffer! And these contingencies were all consumed by you beasts, instead of being used to benefit the human race!"

"One could say the Culture King and Martial King were fools, but they had a good elder brother who took on this responsibility for them! And you... you only know how to take, not how to give, and no one is willing to take on this responsibility!"

What nonsense!

Did they really think Su Yu didn't understand?

The contingencies left by the Human Emperor were enough for the human race to use, to protect themselves, even to rise again. Yet, the Torchbearer lineage was all but wiped out by Hundred Battle's faction!

Su Yu's face turned icy. "Perhaps, from the very beginning, from the first tide, your people were already in the shadows! By the time it reached you, it was merely at its peak. Perhaps from the first tide, your people were already killing those loyal to the Human Emperor!"

Hundred Battle remained silent.

Su Yu's face grew colder!

He suddenly looked at Chang Mei and Chang Qing, then laughed!

"I think... maybe I guessed right!"

Yes, perhaps from the first tide, someone was already killing those from the Human Emperor's faction, leading to countless years of standoff between the myriad races and the human race, just waiting for the day the Gate of Hell could be opened!

Otherwise, wouldn't it have been better to bring the Human Emperor and his people back sooner, returning to the way things were?

"So... the wars of the past hundred thousand years were all caused by you!"

Su Yu murmured, "Countless humans died, countless ancient powerhouses perished! All because of you! The Sin Clan's ancestral teaching was to prevent the Culture King and the others from returning, perhaps it should also include preventing the Human Emperor and his people from returning! Maybe the Time Sage was also set up by you!"

Su Yu muttered, "Yes, the Time Sage shouldn't have been such a reckless person, yet he ventured into the Heaven Gate... and encountered danger! And the Control King, because of opening the Gate of Hell, clashed with the Culture King... So, the Culture King absolutely disagreed! The Martial King was in cahoots with him, and the Human Emperor was their elder brother... So perhaps all of this was orchestrated by you!"

Su Yu's face grew increasingly grim!

"Well done... The Time Sage, if nothing unexpected happened, was set up by your faction, wasn't he?"

Su Yu sneered, "Don't deny it, you were sure the Culture King would go to save him! When the Culture King went to save him, he probably didn't tell the Martial King... and someone informed the Martial King, which was also you! Because you knew the Martial King would definitely go to help, because the Martial King was too foolish, he feared his brother would be in danger... isn't that right?"

Hundred Battle chuckled softly, "Su Yu... you're too clever!"

He praised once more, Su Yu was truly too astute!

A series of events, Su Yu had long suspected, but hadn't connected the dots. Today, Su Yu finally understood everything!

From ancient times to now, it was all a conspiracy!
