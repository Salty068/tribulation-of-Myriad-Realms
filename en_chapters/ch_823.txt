Chapter 823: The Most Terrifying Madman

At this moment, Su Yu was incomparably powerful.

Sweeping across the Myriad Realms, exterminating the Sin Clan, driving away the myriad races, and slaying the Hundred Battle King, he truly swept away everything in his path. 

Schemes, conspiracies, waiting, lurking... none of these worked before him!

I alone suppress the heavens!

Four years ago, he had stepped out from Nanyuan, waging endless battles, engaging in relentless slaughter. Four years later, aside from Yu and Zhou Ji, Su Yu had already swept away all his enemies!

Of course... this was only in the Myriad Realms.

To Su Yu, the Myriad Realms was just a small stage.

Because the true powerhouses had left!

The Human Emperor and others were absent, as were the hundreds of rulers of laws from the myriad races. The Immortal Emperor and those like him, who were once second-tier rulers of laws, were now unknown in strength.

And Su Yu, even though he was constantly merging, was only a second-tier existence within his own world.

This was his self-assessment!

Without the augmentation of the Human Emperor's world, he might not even reach the second tier in his own world. That was the gap.

Of course, even if he couldn't reach the second tier, he could still battle Yu!

The second tier might be a watershed.

At least, that's how Su Yu saw it.

Back then, only the Four Extremes Human King and the emperors of the major clans like the Immortal, Demon, and God reached this level. If it were easy to reach, the Martial Emperor, who opened the Heaven Gate, wouldn't be stuck at the peak of the third tier.

This Yu, like the Martial Emperor, was probably at that level.

At this moment, Su Yu still had the power of the Human Emperor to borrow, so his strength was still above hers.

"Can't come?"

"Got taken out by the Martial Emperor?"

Su Yu chuckled, "If even that fool Martial Emperor can kill Zhou Ji... then Zhou Ji is just trash, and I don't need to worry about him!"

The Martial Emperor was not weak, very powerful.

But sometimes, battles weren't just about strength.

If Zhou Ji couldn't even handle the Martial Emperor, Su Yu thought, this person was not worth worrying about, just a small fry!

Even if he reached the third tier, he was still a small fry!

If he couldn't beat the Martial Emperor, it meant he couldn't beat the Martial King, and if he couldn't beat the Martial King, it meant he couldn't beat the Culture King or the Human Emperor... let alone himself!

Alright, Su Yu arrogantly thought too highly of himself.

He couldn't help it; today, he fought smoothly, felt good, and got a bit inflated!

Suddenly, he felt that the Human Emperor was nothing much!

Mainly because he found that the Human Emperor seemed easy to talk to, easy to bully a bit. Su Yu was quite adept at bullying honest people!

Of course, saying the Human Emperor was honest was just a joke.

If he were truly honest, he wouldn't have become the lord of the myriad races.

The key was, with the Human Emperor's path, "All beings are my responsibility, the human race is my responsibility, all things are my responsibility..." Su Yu knew that the Human Emperor actually had heavy shackles, so he was also quite presumptuous.

He stepped towards Yu with a smile, "Yu, how about we have a talk?"

Yu, having just repelled Xingyue with a strike, spoke solemnly, "What do you want to talk about?"

Su Yu smiled, "Well, it seems you're also cultivating the physical body path, or perhaps the Giant Race's physical body path. How about you sever your power of the Great Dao and merge into my world, and I won't kill you. What do you think?"

Yu's face turned ashen!

Wishful thinking!

At this moment, she raised her spear, standing tall, "Su Yu, do you take me for that waste, Hundred Battle?"

Do you think it's that easy to kill me?

Sever my path and merge into your world!

You're dreaming!

Su Yu sighed, "You don't appreciate the offer... Since your son isn't here, I'll kill you first!"

"Kill!"

With a roar, Su Yu suddenly unsealed the lower layer of his world and shouted, "Rulers of laws, all come here!"

Surround and kill!

Who fights one-on-one with you?

Everyone was stunned, and in the next moment, a group of people flew upwards. Red Moon and a few others were a bit out of place, hesitating for a moment. Seeing this, the Great Zhou King immediately transmitted angrily, "Last chance, get up there, what are you dawdling for?"

Idiots?

As for Su Yu ganging up on his opponent... it's perfectly normal!

It's not the first time he's done it!

When he feels he can gang up, he gangs up on his opponent without hesitation!

Back then, the West King's Consort was besieged by a group of powerhouses until her physical body exploded!

Red Moon and the others were really not used to it because Su Yu had been too fierce before, claiming he could single-handedly cut through eternity. But when it came to the last opponent, he suddenly called for a gang-up... it was hard to adapt!

If he had started with a gang-up, everyone would have been used to it.

Red Moon, Blood Shadow, and the others, despite being unaccustomed, saw everyone else charging forward, so they no longer hesitated and quickly moved to attack. Killing Hundred Battle... honestly, after following him for so many years, they couldn't bring themselves to do it.

Killing Yu... Hundred Battle hated her, and so did they!

Even more!

Since that's the case, there's no need to talk about morality, just gang up. Facing Yu alone, these people, having fallen in realm, would probably only last two or three punches.

But... we have numbers!

A lot!

And in Su Yu's world, there's still an amplification, so the weakening isn't too much. It's just that outside, everyone would be weakened a lot.

"Kill!"

"Kill her ancestors!"

"Do her in!"

"..."

The crowd shouted continuously, vulgar and crude, with the coarse voices naturally coming from people like Giant Axe.

And Yu, at this moment, truly changed her expression.

"Su Yu, do you have no regard for face?"

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "Kill you... who would know!"

Really!

I care about face, but those who know I don't care about face have been killed by me. The rest are my own people, so I'm a very face-conscious person. Don't you understand this logic?

So stupid!

Would the Great Zhou King and the others dare to say outside that I don't care about face?

Su Yu grinned, and in the next moment, suddenly, the world shrank, and rings appeared, trapping Yu within. Su Yu said calmly, "Don't get too close, it's too dangerous! There's a risk of falling! Attack from a distance!"

"Form a formation!"

Su Yu commanded with a smile, "Divide into six directions, front, back, left, right, up, and down, two rulers of laws in each direction, attack from a distance, kill! I'll suppress her with my world, grind her to death!"

"Su Yu!"

Yu was furious, with this, she couldn't even think of killing anyone.

Su Yu ignored her, acting as if she didn't exist. At this moment, he also quickly drew power from all directions, panting, "This guy is really strong! Hard to kill, killing her intact is even harder!"

"All control-type powerhouses, control her with me!"

"All attack-type powerhouses, use all your strength to kill!"

"Quickly!"

"Her son might be coming, hurry up, kill her before her son arrives, then kill her son, keep the family neat and tidy..."

Boom!

Su Yu's world suppressed!

At this moment, there were indeed quite a few control-type powerhouses.

Destiny Marquis's eyes revealed a line, which quickly wrapped around all directions, sealing the void.

The Great Zhou King controlled the path of endurance, constantly shouting, suppressing Yu Ji. Others also lined up, attacking from all directions. This kind of tactic was rare, more common in the military, but rare in battles between powerhouses.

But Su Yu... he was essentially a military man. In the Great Xia Prefecture, almost everyone was a soldier, and in the academy, such military formations were often taught!

His first real battle was following the Windcatcher Department of Nanyuan on a mission. At that time, a group of Great Strength cultivators dealt with an Infinite Strength cultivator just like this!

Yu, trapped in the middle, roared continuously, her spear waving impenetrably. Holding the spear, she roared continuously, stabbing out, shattering the surrounding seals!

But soon, the seals were restored!

With Su Yu personally suppressing, the pressure was still immense.

Not only that, but others were also using all kinds of weapons, smashing them onto her!

The South King, previously forced back by her spear, was still holding a grudge. Women can be petty, and the whip of the Great Dao cracked the void, lashing towards her face!

With a bang, it blocked Fat Ball's boot but didn't block the South King's whip. In the blink of an eye, a blood mark appeared on her face!

"You deserve to die!"

Yu was furious!

"You are courting death, desecrating the great progeny of the Human Ancestor!"

She was a descendant of the Human Ancestor, and not many generations removed.

At this moment, Yu felt the pressure, overwhelming pressure, the pressure of death.

On Su Yu's side, there were too many rulers of laws.

Giant Axe, Destiny, South King, Red Moon, Great Zhou King, Blood Shadow, Undead Emperor, and Hongmeng were all rulers of laws who severed their paths to merge. The South King had actually already mastered the rules of this place, so it wasn't considered severing the path.

Additionally, Lanshan, Skyfire, and Consort Qi were also incredibly powerful in this world. As Su Yu's world grew stronger, everyone's combat power within it reached a limit.

At this time, with so many powerhouses joining forces to besiege her, in the blink of an eye, her armor shattered, revealing her bloodied chest.

Very large!

Su Yu glanced, smiling, and beside him, Xingyue's phantom suddenly said, "You're shameless!"

Su Yu was taken aback, "What?"

Is it shameless to gang up on her?

Xingyue really has long hair and short knowledge!

Of course, I have to gang up on her. Do you expect me to fight one-on-one and say, 'I challenge you alone'... am I sick?

Xingyue said nothing more, quickly saying, "I have to go... the battle over there isn't going well. The Myriad Races haven't lost many rulers of laws over the years, and a new batch has emerged, even stronger than the ancient ones... The Human Race has suffered significant losses... be careful!"

With that, her phantom began to dissipate. Su Yu's expression changed slightly, not because Xingyue was leaving, but he hurriedly said, "Can't hold on? Then the Human Emperor's world will retract?"

"How would I know!"

Xingyue's dissatisfied voice faintly came, asking this, how boring, aren't you going to ask if I'm doing well over there?

Su Yu didn't care about that, hurriedly shouting, "Don't rush to leave, let those cultivating the physical body path, those who aren't dead yet, be careful. In a few days, I might extract most of the power from it... let them be prepared... of course, I'll leave them some... remember, don't forget, it's a big deal, otherwise, if a Human King dies, don't blame me for not warning!"

"Got it!"

With a hum, the River of Time extended, and Xingyue's phantom disappeared!

Although she wanted to linger a bit longer, it was impossible. The power of the River of Time was too fierce. If she didn't leave now, even her true form would be in danger!

Su Yu finally exhaled, "You almost scared me to death. If you were going to leave, you should have said so earlier. I nearly forgot to remind you."

Inside the encirclement, Yu roared furiously, fighting madly to break out, but he couldn't escape!

At this moment, Yu shouted in anger, "Su Yu, don't push me to the brink! I am a direct descendant of the Human Ancestor. The Human Ancestor left behind some power. Though it's not strong, it's enough to deal with your broken world. Do you really want to perish together with me?"

Su Yu was taken aback, "Is that true?"

"Of course!"

Yu roared, and suddenly, his spear shattered, revealing its true form—a slender bamboo pole. Yu shouted angrily, "This is what the Human Ancestor used when leading the Human Race out of desperate straits! In the past, the Human Ancestor led the Human Race through hardships, conquering the Myriad Realms... This item was frequently used by the Human Ancestor in his early years, even more powerful than the Xingyu Imprint of the Human Emperor!"

At this moment, Su Yu indeed felt a vast power emanating from it!

That power... how to describe it? It was somewhat similar to the Xingyu Imprint and the Human Lord Seal, yet different. It was indeed powerful. As the bamboo pole appeared, a vast power spread in all directions.

The surrounding attackers suddenly felt a sense of dread.

That power... was sacred!

Majestic!

Gradually, a faint image appeared—a weary old man cutting through thorns and brambles, using the bamboo pole to probe the way, striking at some lurking beasts and serpents. The vague image was awe-inspiring.

Some people, even their minds were shaken, showing signs of being intimidated.

Su Yu glanced around. He saw more clearly than others. He even saw the old man's appearance, looking exhausted, holding the bamboo pole, striking at a mischievous little beast.

Upon closer inspection... it seemed to be in chaos!

Looking again... he gasped!

What little beast? It was a fierce, striped tiger, immensely powerful, yet before the old man, it appeared small, its head beaten bloody by the bamboo pole, even the power of laws spilling out!

Vaguely, Su Yu even realized that this was a chaotic beast, possibly... possibly possessing the strength of a ruler of laws!

And the old man, as if driving away a troublesome beast, lightly struck it with the pole, sending it flying, unable to rise for a long time!

"So strong!"

Su Yu was shocked, amazed!

This... was like beating a ruler of laws as if it were a child.

The Human Ancestor!

What era was this Human Ancestor from?

It should be early on, didn't Yu say so?

In the early days, the Human Ancestor used this thing, just like the Human Emperor used the Xingyu Imprint before unifying the Myriad Realms!

"Is this what Hundred Battle saw?"

Su Yu pondered. It was indeed powerful. Such a strong Human Ancestor... Did Su Yu really think the Human Emperor of the late ancient times was stronger than the Human Ancestor?

Fighting a ruler of laws like this?

Incredible!

Moreover, it seemed the higher one's status, or the stronger the Human Race's fortune, the clearer the vision. Su Yu glanced around and noticed that others were not as affected, but a few showed fear, sweating profusely.

The Great Zhou King, Lantian, Wan Tiansheng...

On the contrary, those with weaker fortune, average strength, or from other races, didn't feel it as strongly, only showing some shock.

"Human Ancestor..."

Su Yu murmured. Indeed, the Human Ancestor was the leader of the Human Race in the ancient times. The more prosperous the Human Race's fortune, the clearer the vision, which was normal.

And at this moment, Su Yu suddenly felt a change!

In an instant, he seemed to become that fierce beast, and at that moment, his vision blurred, and a bamboo pole struck him. With a bang, Su Yu felt like he was going to die!

The Dao shattered!

His incredibly strong body cracked, his internal organs shattered!

Death!

At this moment, he seemed to feel the crisis of death, true death... He seemed to personally experience the feeling of being struck by the Human Ancestor's bamboo pole!

...

The next moment, Su Yu's vision cleared again, seeing everything before him.

The encirclement continued!

The bamboo pole was still there, but the overwhelming pressure from before was gone. Yu's face was pale, as if she had deliberately unleashed it, but now she couldn't sustain it and had to stop.

Yu looked coldly at Su Yu, sneering, "Let me go, Su Yu!"

Su Yu's face was pale, staring at the bamboo pole. Yu thought he was scared!

But Su Yu was inhaling deeply, continuously, "Amazing, truly amazing, this bamboo pole... a supreme treasure! Damn, it's wasted on you! No, I want this, I must have this!"

Su Yu swallowed, a bit crazed, "Stronger than the Xingyu Imprint, and an offensive weapon... Heaven, the Human Ancestor's treasure, such a good thing! Kill her, even if her son comes today, he can't save her, even if her grandfather comes, it's useless!"

Su Yu roared, "What are you looking at, Great Zhou King, are you deaf? Kill! We must kill her! At worst, if you die, I'll find a way to revive you! This thing is a treasure! I was drawn into it, experienced the feeling of death... so exhilarating, haven't felt it for days, last time was during the opening of the heavens, that was two months ago!"

Yu was stunned!

Su Yu, however, wasn't fazed at all, shouting, "Hurry up!"

The feeling of death... so exhilarating!

Unfortunately, can't sleep, just like last time, felt like time stopped, could take a nap.

As for the death crisis... pfft!

Su Yu didn't care at all, I've been driven crazy by the Book of Time since I was a kid, died thousands of times, last time truly experienced the feeling of death, to be honest... it's just that!

The first time experiencing death... that was terrifying, very scary!

Su Yu had such memories, that was the first time dreaming, scared him into a fever for days, delirious, sleepless nights, almost killed himself from exhaustion, didn't dare to sleep, psychological shadow!

The second time... about the same, still very scared!

The third time, still scared!

The fourth, fifth time... until now, Su Yu just wanted to say, screw it, what's the big deal, isn't it just this feeling?

You get used to it!

Habit, that's the most terrifying power.

Was Hundred Battle scared by this?

Su Yu thought, maybe so!

At that time, maybe Hundred Battle really experienced this feeling of death for the first time, then got intimidated by Yu, maybe really got scared, the Human Ancestor's incredibly strong power, how could he dare to resist?

When Hundred Battle encountered Yu, he might have just been a Heavenly King, the bamboo pole's effect stronger, plus he was the ninth generation Human Lord, the strongest fortune, at the peak, probably saw a lot!

Thinking this way, Su Yu somewhat understood.

But... but so what?

I was a kid, experienced death, didn't see me scared to death!

Su Yu was speechless!

I started experiencing it at 6, didn't see me scared to death, didn't I survive?

Su Yu was still thinking, while Yu's expression changed, because she saw an even more terrifying scene. With Su Yu's roar, the Great Zhou King and others, who were initially a bit scared, suddenly seemed invigorated, roaring, charging at her!

Su Yu continued to shout, "Hurry, kill her, we must seize that bamboo pole! Such a treasure, I've already decided, must break it, integrate it into my world, for Marquis Giant Bamboo or March to use, my heavens, March, you and Giant Bamboo better step up, I might produce a supreme powerhouse!"

"Whichever of you is stronger, I'll give it to you, otherwise, I'll give it to September..."

"Roar!"

March's body instantly enlarged, at this moment, Marquis Giant Bamboo too, the next moment, September's body suddenly enlarged, even bigger than Marquis Giant Bamboo!

March was furious, roaring, "You two bastards, September, you unfilial descendant..."

Even September wanted to snatch it!

Beat him to death!

But Marquis Giant Bamboo ignored him, silently holding a large bamboo, crazily slashing at Yu!

Beat you to death!

And at this moment, a roar echoed through the heavens, "Mine! Your Majesty, mine!"

Heavendoom suddenly transformed into a giant ape, roaring, "I also use a bamboo pole! Your Majesty, I do too!"

Boom!

He transformed into a giant ape, his last chance!

I must become strong!

I can't go on like this, I'm too miserable, I must become strong, I must kill Yu, seize this bamboo pole, make it my supreme treasure of the Dao!

I must become a supreme powerhouse!

Su Yu said a supreme powerhouse, so obviously, once integrated into the world, it might produce a top-tier powerhouse second only to Su Yu!

Heavendoom thought, my path of the great club... what's the difference with a bamboo pole?

None!

I must kill!

"Heavendoom Eighteen Styles!"

"Destroy Heaven, Destroy Earth, Destroy All Beings!"

Boom!

A great club swept through the heavens, sweeping through the void, Heavendoom went mad, booming, the great club struck Yu, Yu slightly raised the bamboo pole, and Heavendoom's great club from Immortal Battle Marquis was instantly broken in two!

And Heavendoom, instead of being shocked, laughed crazily, "Mine, it must be mine!"

So strong!

But at this moment, there were too many competitors, March, Giant Bamboo, September, all erupted!

Over there, April, May, June, August, all raised large bamboos, crazily charging this way, April's eyes bulging, "I can do it too, I can too! I can too! Ah, fight, fight!"

"......"

This crazy scene left Su Yu dumbfounded.

I... just said it casually.

This Iron Devourer Race, all went mad!

Except for Full Moon being a bit reserved, the other Iron Devourers, all went mad, Heavendoom too, this was a third-tier top-level ruler of laws, not a third-tier Daofuse!

Even if Su Yu suppressed the opponent, the opponent was still very strong!

Aren't you afraid of total annihilation?

And Yu, more bewildered than Su Yu, was momentarily stunned by the assault!

Aren't they afraid of the Human Ancestor?

She couldn't hold back any longer and roared, "Do you truly have no fear of the Human Emperor's might?"

Even if the non-human races didn't care, what about the humans?

Of course, they were afraid! But at this moment... someone couldn't help but mutter, "His Majesty is even scarier!"

"..."

Su Yu's eyes widened. Who said that?

Nonsense!

Am I scary?

I am a benevolent ruler!

Just like the Human Emperor, I am exceedingly kind to my subordinates and people. Who dares to spread such rumors?

Su Yu's eyes were wide open, glaring at someone—specifically, the King of Annihilation, who had somehow reached the level of a Heavenly King but had a rather low presence. Su Yu angrily said, "Are you spreading rumors?"

"..."

The King of Annihilation turned pale. It wasn't me!

Nonsense!

I didn't say anything!

"Beat her! Annihilation, you go!"

Su Yu shouted angrily, "Use your time powers, kick her, kick her back to her weakened state, quickly, kick her from a distance!"

"..."

The King of Annihilation gritted his teeth and kicked wildly, shattering the entire void with his kicks. At this moment, Yu vaguely felt something strange, as if time was flowing, but very slowly!

The impact on her wasn't significant!

Meanwhile, the King of Annihilation was panting heavily!

The gap was too large!

Is this a joke?

How am I supposed to kick her?

But... he didn't dare not to kick!

Su Yu was not someone with a big heart. If he didn't put in the effort, he had no doubt that soon, a certain incident from the past would become widely known, and not only that, it might even go down in history!

Forget it, I was just being too honest!

I said something truthful, and it was overheard. Those bastards just stayed silent!

Honest people always have it rough!

...

Yu was truly in disbelief!

Su Yu, scarier than the Human Emperor?

Alright, actually, it was because their influence wasn't too significant, and the main force was borne by Su Yu, who didn't care about it. Plus, Su Yu was indeed quite terrifying, at least in the eyes of some, he was more intimidating than the Human Emperor!

Given that, naturally, it couldn't affect them too much.

"Su Yu!"

Yu roared, "Are you forcing me to fight to the death? If I truly shatter this item, your world will be seventy percent destroyed!"

Su Yu's expression changed, "You scared me!"

In an instant, he hurriedly pulled, "Thanks for the reminder! People can be resurrected, but if the world is destroyed, it's over. Fortunately, the Human Emperor's world hasn't retreated yet. Thank you, I'll first pull the Human Emperor's world near you... You can blow up the Human Emperor's, just don't blow up mine, please, he doesn't want it anyway!"

Yu was stunned, and the next moment, she looked utterly hopeless!

Su Yu... right, he had two layers of heaven!

One was Su Yu's, and the other was the Human Emperor's, which hadn't dissipated yet!

Below, the Great Zhou King and others cursed inwardly. This was too inhumane; could the Human Emperor's heaven just be blown up like that?

Su Yu didn't care about that, smiling as he said, "Hit her for me! Yu, if you surrender now, sever your path, I'll spare your life. Otherwise, hehe, use whatever means you want to threaten me, it's up to you!"

"If you want to self-destruct this bamboo pole... I don't mind. The Human Emperor's heaven is just sitting there, you blow it up, I'll conveniently merge it, and I won't even need the Human Emperor's consent. Please, blow it up!"

Su Yu cheerfully said, "Please, I'm begging you! Self-destruct! If you self-destruct and then blow up the bamboo pole, you can definitely shatter the Human Emperor's heaven. Normally, people can't do it, but if you blow it up, that's the best...”

Su Yu paused, suddenly saying, "Don't rush, wait a moment, blowing it up here might not break it. I'll take you to the Celestial River's mouth, blow it up there, and you'll definitely break it! Don't rush, stay calm, I'll move the world, it'll be quick, very quick... Please!"

With that, Su Yu acted immediately, roaring, and suddenly transformed into a giant, dragging a massive world, roaring continuously as he flew towards the Dao Source Land, not very fast.

Su Yu roared, "Hold on a bit longer for the self-destruction, I'm begging you, make sure to blow it up at the Celestial River's mouth, aim properly, otherwise it's really hard to break, the Human Emperor is very strong! Even though his heaven is a defective product... normally, people can't break it! This way, you also gain something, otherwise, if you blow it up, it's a waste, blow it up at the Celestial River's mouth, you can break the Human Emperor's path, even if you die, you can proudly say you blew up the Human Emperor's heaven, directly breaking it!"

"..."

Silence!

At this moment, Yu was in despair, silent, dejected, collapsing, and going mad...

Too many emotions were crashing into her!

Because... Su Yu was serious!

He wasn't even hitting her anymore; he was running to carry the world, really flying towards the Dao Source Land, albeit slowly, but Su Yu was persistently flying in that direction, shouting as he flew, "As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood, wait a bit, live as long as you can, the earlier you self-destruct, the earlier you die, without any achievements, wait a bit longer!"

"I'm begging you, please, sister!"

"..."

Yu Ji was about to go crazy!

"Is sister not good? How about sister-in-law? I'm on good terms with Brother Hundred Battles, I was wrong, I should have killed Moon Luo, shouldn't have let them be a pair of dead lovers, I'm sorry, sister-in-law, don't rush, I'll definitely dig up their graves, no, I'll definitely grind their bones to dust, those adulterous couple, deserve to die!"

At this moment, Yu was utterly hopeless!

Su Yu was a madman!

A true madman!

A complete madman!

He really didn't care about a fight to the death because even if the fish died, the net wouldn't break!

What would be blown up was just the Human Emperor's heaven!

What did it have to do with Su Yu?

Blow it up if you want, just please blow it up a bit later, wait until I drag the world to the Celestial River's mouth.

When you encounter someone like Su Yu, none of your methods work on him, and anyone would feel hopeless!

And just as Su Yu was carrying the world, struggling to fly in that direction, a voice of lamentation sounded, "Emperor Yu, why bother?"

Su Yu didn't even turn his head, "Nephew, don't play this game with me! Be normal! Those who pretend with me, I usually kill them quickly, if you want, I can fulfill your wish!"

"Emperor Yu... truly straightforward!"

A laugh came, and the next moment, a figure appeared at the edge of the world, riding a massive beast resembling a Kunpeng, looking at Su Yu, and said, "My mother..."

"Sever your path, merge into my world, hand over the bamboo pole! Also, give up all the human race's physical paths, and you can reunite with your mother!"

In the distance, the young man sitting cross-legged on the beast, Zhou Ji, spoke softly, "Aren't you afraid that if I kill my way in now, you really can't stop me?"

Su Yu laughed, "Try it! Nephew, if you don't dare to come in, I'll consider your words as nonsense! If you dare, just come in directly!"

"Then... how about exchanging information?"

The young man smiled, "First, the location of the Heaven Gate! Second, the life of the Martial Emperor!"

Su Yu laughed, "If you can kill the Martial Emperor, I'll consider you impressive! That fool was probably left behind by you, still wandering aimlessly in the chaos! As for the location of the Heaven Gate... haha, unless our Heaven Gate can become a true gate, it's just on both sides of the River of Time, idiot, you're trying to sell me information?"

"..."

Silence!

Absolute silence!

At this moment, Su Yu turned back, and on the beast, the young Zhou Ji's expression grew much more serious. After a while, he spoke, "Emperor Yu... truly the first person in ten thousand years!"

Su Yu sneered, "Are you trying to play tricks with me?"

Su Yu coldly laughed, "You can play with ancient beasts in the chaos! Who taught you? Changqing, a fake strategist! Changmei, a sycophant! Wuji, a fake brute, a real fool! Hongyue and Xueying, average intelligence, trying to be ancient loyal ministers, but lacking brains! The Ancient Giant King? Don't joke, a fool! Your mother? Don't joke, her brain is mush..."

Su Yu coldly laughed, "They don't even dare to send you to the Myriad Realms for training, raising you in secret, what kind of brain can they cultivate? Sorry, even though I'm younger than you, your Grandpa Su, I've been fighting since I was a kid, and the key is I have no background, dare to bully you, and you? Even if you're trained, everyone knows you're the crown prince, who dares to bully you? They're just fooling a crown prince like you!"

"..."

Such disdain!

Zhou Ji was slightly taken aback, then smiled and nodded, "Perhaps!"

Su Yu also smiled, "Your father was killed by me!"

Zhou Ji thought for a moment, remained silent, then nodded, "I know."

Zhou Ji was relatively calm, "He... actually wasn't very familiar with me... as for feelings, I can only say they were average, I was just an unexpected product of him and my mother, or rather, they had a purpose in having me! I was also their pawn... I understand all this, just not willing to care about it!"

"Their idea was simple, to cultivate me, make me strong, physically strong, to bear the will of the Human Ancestor..."

Zhou Ji smiled, "I know all this, just too lazy to talk about it! They thought I didn't know, but I... don't like participating in these things! Do you think the method of bearing on the demon side was prepared for whom? Modona, you should know, on the demon side, before the Demon Emperor wanted Modona to bear his three bodies... actually, this technique was passed on by my mother and them..."

Su Yu was taken aback, he really didn't know this!

And in the world, the injured Yu was also shocked, exclaiming, "You knew!"

Zhou Ji smiled and nodded, "I knew!"

He looked at Su Yu, "Many things don't come out of nowhere! For example, the demons previously wanted to resurrect the undead, it was also an attempt, trying to see if they could revive some strong ones, bring them back to the living realm, of course not as fighters, but as nourishment, to open the Gate of Hell!"

"For example, people like Modona, cultivated as geniuses, were actually to test if willpower coverage could occupy the body... the experiment seemed quite successful!"

"The gods and immortals rarely really do this, just for show, but the demons... have really experimented many times!"

Zhou Ji chuckled lightly, "I've seen through all of this. I know they want to ensure everything is foolproof, all for my sake! If the Human Ancestor's true form can't be summoned, then they'll first summon the willpower of the Human Ancestor. Right now, I'm already a third-tier peak ruler of laws from ancient times... The moment the Human Ancestor descends, I can break through to the second tier, or even... the first tier! Then everything will be easy. At that time, my strength will be enough to sweep through everything, and I can forcibly open the Gate of Hell..."

His smile was serene, "I understand all of this! But... Father, the conflict with you is an internal struggle among the humans, a struggle for the position of Human Lord. If I intervene, there will be no room for maneuver. However, Mother... she doesn't have such deep hatred with you!"

"Emperor Yu, can you allow me to repay my mother's grace of giving birth to me?"

Zhou Ji spoke softly, "You can take the bamboo pole..."

"No, you cannot!"

At this moment, Yu was extremely furious, "Ji'er, you broke in... shatter this world, he can't do anything to me!"

Zhou Ji sighed, "Mother, I'm saving you to repay the grace of giving birth! Otherwise, I know Emperor Yu's deeds and character. He will kill you, take the bamboo pole, and even integrate your corpse into his world... He won't spare you!"

"Now, Mother, hand over the bamboo pole, and I will pay some price for you. I will voluntarily sever the human race's physical path as compensation for Emperor Yu's loss... In this way, can my mother and I leave?"

Su Yu inhaled sharply, "You... you're either extremely dangerous or extremely virtuous! You remind me of a little friend, Wan Mingze, Old Wan's grandnephew, who was either a good person or extremely bad... I feel like I need to take you down!"

This guy, Su Yu suddenly felt, needed to be taken down!

How dangerous!

His father died, and he didn't care.

His mother was about to die, and only then did he show up, and he immediately offered to sever the human race's physical path and hand over the bamboo pole. These things, you could say, he offered the price to the extreme all at once!

At this moment, the young man in the distance, Zhou Ji, suddenly smiled, "Brother Su... do you remember me?"

"......"

Su Yu was stunned. He looked again and was truly taken aback. He suddenly looked at Old Wan, and Wan Tiansheng's expression changed slightly.

That young man suddenly transformed into the appearance of Wan Mingze!

Old Wan said in a deep voice, "Mingze is in the Abyssal Realm..."

Wan Mingze wasn't dead!

But this young man...

The young Zhou Ji chuckled softly, "It's just some concealment methods. Brother Su said I never experienced the hardships of the mortal world, but that's not true! I have experienced it! My name is Ji, and I also wanted to see and try how to save this country and its people!"

This time, Su Yu truly inhaled sharply, "You... you're Wan Mingze?"

"Not exactly... but also yes!"

Zhou Ji smiled, "That wasn't my true self, just a willpower incarnation! My true self is mostly in chaos!"

Among the crowd, Wan Tiansheng's face didn't look good. He squinted his eyes, "So, my grandnephew was killed by you?"

"No!"

Zhou Ji shook his head, "Perhaps, I should call you Second Grandfather! Experiencing the mortal world, experiencing everything, killing to replace is not a good method. A character was nurtured, and when the character landed, it became Wan Mingze... From the beginning, Wan Mingze was me, and I was Wan Mingze, without any killing..."

It could only be said that even the pregnancy and childbirth were fake, orchestrated by this guy!

And Su Yu couldn't help but laugh, "Truly impressive! Truly amazing! So, from the beginning, you were observing..."

"Not exactly!"

Zhou Ji smiled again, "You know Lantian, his avatars severed their connections, becoming independent entities! And I'm the same! I severed all connections long ago, after all... the human race still has a strong figure like the Great Zhou King, I wouldn't rashly connect my avatar to my main body, only recently did I absorb and digest some of what I saw and gained!"

Su Yu nodded, "So, you killed Wan Mingze!"

"That was my avatar..."

"So, you killed the grandnephew of Principal Wan!"

"That was my avatar..."

"So, you killed my close friend!"

"......"

Zhou Ji fell silent.

Whatever you say!

Were you and Wan Mingze really close friends?

Su Yu was just looking for trouble!

And Su Yu, coldly said, "How about this, you enter my world, and we spar a bit, then I'll agree to your request!"

"......"

Zhou Ji sighed, "Emperor Yu, why do this! I'm not a fool either, if I enter your world, can I still come out?"

He was silent for a moment and said, "If Emperor Yu is still not satisfied... my mother and I can also enter the Gate of Hell. I know Emperor Yu is wary of us, afraid we'll mess up your plans outside. I can leave... and also take a look at how strong the Human Ancestor is? It would also prevent my mother from wanting to use my body to summon the Human Ancestor! In this way, it wouldn't harm the mother-son relationship! Emperor Yu, do you think this is satisfactory?"

Su Yu squinted his eyes, "Are you sure I can't kill you?"

"No, if Emperor Yu really wants to risk it, you can still do it!"

Zhou Ji said softly, "I also understand Emperor Yu, you're ruthless, if you really explode this world, willing to pay the price, I will surely die! But if Emperor Yu doesn't explode this world... it's still very difficult to kill me! As for the Martial Emperor, at this moment, he's probably still looking for me, not knowing how long it will take, for Emperor Yu, at this moment, what you need more is time, otherwise, when the Martial Emperor returns, maybe... time will be too late!"

He smiled, "I know Emperor Yu cares more about the big picture..."

Su Yu grinned, "No, I just think you're very dangerous! So... I've decided, to kill you, and then talk about other things!"

Boom!

Su Yu threw out his world, shouting, "Continue to besiege her, I'll go kill this beast who killed my friend!"

Boom!

With a punch, Su Yu directly exited the world, Zhou Ji's face changed slightly, and he also punched out. Both sides retreated a step, but Su Yu roared again, punching once more. Zhou Ji was about to punch when suddenly, boom!

Below, the ancient beast was directly shattered into pieces by Su Yu's punch!

It exploded!

Su Yu quickly laughed, "Just kidding, accidentally killed your mount, sorry! How about this, give me the bamboo pole, you sever the human race's physical path, you reunite with your mother, go to the Gate of Hell to find your ancestors, I'm a righteous person, I won't even hold you accountable for killing my friend!"

Zhou Ji's face was somewhat heavy, Su Yu grinned, raising his eyebrows, "We're family, just joking earlier!"

Almost saying, I see your strength isn't bad, I might not be able to kill you in a solo fight outside, forget it, just give me what I want, and I'll let you go!

Zhou Ji was somewhat heavy, "If Emperor Yu could suppress me just now..."

"You'd be dead!"

Su Yu smiled brightly, "Then you'd definitely be dead, I see you're not weak, right? I'm a realistic person, you're not weak, then we're friends, right, nephew!"

Zhou Ji was silent for a while, then quickly smiled, "Then I have to thank myself for being strong, otherwise... today my mother and I would surely die, right?"

Su Yu smiled and nodded, "Smart! Nephew is really smart! Good, let your mother hand over the treasure, then you sever the path, and I'll let her go, you two go to the Gate of Hell!"

In the world, Yu roared angrily, "No! Ji'er, break in... you and I together, he..."

Su Yu's face suddenly changed, "Then go die!"

Boom!

At this moment, a powerful force suddenly exploded in the world, over a hundred paths of power suddenly shattered, blasting Yu into a bloody mess. Su Yu roared in anger, "Kill her!"

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, the Great Zhou King and others went mad, fighting fiercely, Su Yu was also cold and indifferent, one path of power after another exploded, causing Yu to continuously vomit blood. Su Yu said coldly, "I've paid such a high price, if she doesn't die, you'll have to pay an even greater price to redeem her! All of this, she brought upon herself! You'll have to pay an even greater price, and she... will suffer even more severe injuries!"

Zhou Ji sighed, looking at Su Yu, "Emperor Yu... as ruthless as ever!"

Truly ruthless!

"I will return the human race's fortune that my father deprived, to Emperor Yu, the Human Ancestor's fortune left by the Giant Race, all integrated into Emperor Yu's world... does Emperor Yu think this is enough?"

The next moment, Su Yu revealed a bright smile, shouting, "Alright, stop, how are you treating my sister-in-law? Stop hitting, if you kill her, my nephew will be angry!"

Everyone instantly stopped, and at this moment, Yu was covered in blood, her eyes full of fear!

At this moment, she didn't dare to speak anymore, she was scared!

Su Yu, truly a madman!

A real madman!

He would explode the paths in his own world without a second thought, he was crazy!

This was a complete madman, even Yu, at this moment, was extremely frightened, the fear she imagined Su Yu had, completely didn't exist!

And Zhou Ji, actually anticipated this.

Ordinary people, he really wasn't afraid of, like the Martial Emperor.

Others, even if their strength reached Su Yu's level, he wasn't afraid, but this was Su Yu.

Su Yu, had actually gone mad long ago.

Or rather, all along, Su Yu was a madman, because he was driven mad from a young age, absorbing Wan Mingze's memories, he judged, Su Yu was a crazy yet cold-blooded person.

A scholar, was just his last facade.

Tear off this mask, Su Yu was the craziest person in the myriad realms, anyone who was killed countless times wouldn't be a normal person.

Zhou Ji knew all of this!

So, he didn't want to really fight with Su Yu, if they fought, maybe he and Yu could win, but in the end, the loss would be much more severe than now, he and Yu would surely die, one or both!

Like Tiangu, Zhou Ji would rather take Yu, enter the Gate of Hell, to see the situation inside, than to continue fighting with Su Yu here.

At this moment, Zhou Ji saw Yu not speaking anymore, sighed, "Mother, hand over the bamboo pole! I'm afraid Emperor Yu will turn hostile... once my mother is out, I will sever my human race's physical path..."

Su Yu bared his teeth, "I'm also worried that once your mother is out, you'll turn against me!"

Zhou Ji gave a bitter smile, "I won't... I still want to see a broader world. The Three Gates haven't opened, the Human Emperor hasn't returned, and Emperor Yu, don't you think it would be a waste to die now?"

"That makes sense!"

Su Yu nodded, smiling as he bared his teeth, "Release them!"

"Your Majesty!" The Great Zhou King and the others were shocked. Really let them go? What if Yu turns against them once she's out? Are they betting that Zhou Ji won't turn against them? But Yu is unpredictable!

Su Yu chuckled, "It's fine. Let me make this clear: if they turn against us after being released, then today, if I don't kill this mother and son, I won't be called Su!"

He spoke with unwavering determination!

Zhou Ji said nothing more, turning to Yu and softly saying, "Mother, hand over the bamboo pole!"

Yu's face was full of reluctance! But... she still handed it over. Soon, she flew towards the outside of the world, gritting her teeth, planning to speak after leaving Su Yu's world! As for whether to turn against them... she was considering it!

The moment she flew out, Zhou Ji suddenly grunted, a surge of the power of laws dispersed, spreading into Su Yu's world. Zhou Ji chuckled, "Mother, I've severed the Human Race's physical path..."

Yu's face turned ashen! She understood! Her son's intention was that there was no need to turn against them. Even if she was out, he was now injured, severely injured! He didn't even give Yu a chance to cause trouble!

Meanwhile, Su Yu's eyes flickered, itching to kill him!

Zhou Ji chuckled, "Emperor Yu... there's no need, is there? If I enter the Gate of Hell... maybe I can even help you explore the path, so why bother?"

Su Yu suppressed the killing intent in his heart, smiling, "Right, no problem!"

In reality, it was because even though Zhou Ji had severed his path, Su Yu found that his strength hadn't diminished much!

Zhou Ji also smiled, and in the next moment, a large seal fell into Su Yu's world, "This is what my father left me... now, I return it to the Human Race... it also counts as repaying everything for my father!"

"When a person dies, everything... should be erased!"

With the death of a person, debts are erased. At this moment, Zhou Ji returned the fortune that Hundred Battle had stripped away back then.

In the next moment, he grabbed Yu and swiftly flew towards the Gate of Hell, his voice carrying a hint of lament, "Brother Su, you and I are merely survivors of this era, there's no need to direct hostility at me..."

Su Yu smiled, watching them leave, baring his teeth as he muttered, "Nonsense, you don't get angry when I killed your father, a father's death... I'd be a fool to believe you!"

If you were confident in killing me, you would have acted long ago!

"A tough character!"

Su Yu laughed, "What a pity..."

He didn't continue, and several people appeared beside him. The Great Zhou King spoke in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, you weren't confident in taking him down?"

"I was... but you might all die. I was bluffing them; could I bear to let you die?"

Su Yu's smile was radiant, carrying a benevolent expression, "I love my people like my children, love my soldiers like my children, my comrades, I love you all, how could I bear to let you die? Reviving is very difficult now! Subduing the Myriad Realms without bloodshed, why fight and kill, wouldn't it be a pointless death? They've gone to the Gate of Hell, everything is negotiable!"

A group of people remained silent!

Don't smile, your smile sends chills down our spines!

In the distance, the Gate of Hell trembled, and in the next moment, Zhou Ji, with Yu, entered the Gate of Hell. Zhou Ji's voice echoed again, "Brother Su... sorry, I deceived you, the Martial Emperor is returning soon!"

Su Yu grinned, "I know, but the Martial Emperor is an idiot. When he returns, he might think you're formidable and attack me, you know?"

Zhou Ji's voice paused, and in the next moment, the Martial Emperor's voice echoed, filled with anger, "Damn, so cunning, almost as cunning as Su Yu, why not join forces to kill Su Yu..."

Boom!

At the last moment, Zhou Ji only saw Su Yu leading a group of people, swiftly charging towards the Martial Emperor, Su Yu's angry shout resounding through the heavens, "Kill this bastard!"

Boom!

Explosions rang out, and Zhou Ji had no time to watch, he had already disappeared!

The Gate of Hell trembled, sealing completely once more!

At the last moment, Zhou Ji perhaps regretted it, the Martial Emperor... wasn't Su Yu's man?

Impossible!

Then all the effort I put in, wasn't it... all in vain?

Su Yu tricked me, yes, he's good at deception!
