Chapter 783: The Martial Emperor Dies Again

The tribulation of thunder forged a new life!

Marquis Lanshan, half-dead from the lightning strikes, roared madly, shouting in both pain and joy! Sometimes, being a living dead was truly sorrowful. No taste, no pain, no touch. Everything seen through their eyes was dull and gray.

But today, Marquis Lanshan felt alive! She was alive, reborn! The thunder tribulations in the sky seemed to tell her, "You are a living person now!" Despite the agony!

Marquis Lanshan roared, and after her roar, she suddenly said, "Your Majesty, I am of the sword dao, but now I have no sword dao to merge with!"

"..."

Goodness, you just thought of that now!

Su Yu was speechless. Hadn't she been concerned about this before? I even worried about it for a moment! I thought you trusted me, so you didn't ask. Turns out you just forgot. The sword dao, such a common path, was already claimed by Grandstar. He even knocked Empyrean Cloud away for it!

"Merge with the Halberd Dao!" Su Yu commanded in a low voice. Marquis Lanshan was slightly stunned and shouted, "Your Majesty, I don't know how..."

"Nonsense, wielding a sword or a halberd is the same—it's all about slashing. Whether it's a knife, spear, sword, or halberd, aren't they all the same?"

"..."

No problem there!

Alright, Marquis Lanshan was quite helpless. After thinking for a moment, she shouted, "Then... I'll merge with the Halberd Dao. At least I've seen others use it. The halberd is rarely used, and I can't quite discern it!"

"..."

Su Yu was also speechless. Fine, as long as you're happy.

At this moment, in the world below, a great path resembling a long halberd floated in the air. Marquis Lanshan was overjoyed, and her strength quickly began to merge with this long halberd path. As for comprehension... well, the path of the warrior doesn't differ much in comprehension.

Moreover, Marquis Lanshan's use of the sword and the halberd wasn't much different. Even if you gave her an axe, it would be about the same.

At this moment, Su Yu was shouting while observing.

He didn't bother with the undead giant. He extended the path of life and death through the Ink Dao, reaching into his own world. This time, he personally guided the power of life and death, converting it.

While observing Marquis Lanshan, Su Yu was also concerned about potential issues.

After careful observation, Su Yu quickly reached several conclusions.

First, these people indeed cannot return to the River of Time. The appearance of the thunder tribulation is a genuine rejection. Su Yu and the undead path's tribulation was relatively mild. If the River of Time also struck, it would easily kill Lanshan!

Second, the issue of lifespan.

After further observation, Su Yu concluded that those who died young in battle seemed to have their lifespan calculated based on their pre-death lifespan. The time spent as undead seemed to be nullified!

Marquis Lanshan died young. She died before the establishment of the Human Emperor's court, and she was posthumously titled a marquis. When she died, she was only about a thousand years old, considered young among Daofuse cultivators!

Compared to the ancient relics of today, her lifespan was much longer!

After revival, she wouldn't fear dying of old age!

Third, the issue of strength.

Before her death, Marquis Lanshan had Daofuse combat power. After death, she had almost reached the level of a Heavenly King. After merging with the origin, she officially stepped into the Heavenly King realm, nearing the Heavenly Sovereign level!

However, Su Yu noticed that after merging, although Marquis Lanshan's aura became stronger, it was somewhat weaker compared to after merging with the origin. There was a certain loss of power rules in between.

Of course, she was much stronger than before merging with the origin.

Currently, Marquis Lanshan's aura indicated she was at the top-tier Heavenly King level. However, it was uncertain how much power she could exert in her own path. If she was like the Great Xia King and others, her true strength would be between second-tier peak and barely reaching the Heavenly King realm.

Su Yu frowned slightly. After conversion, it seemed the strength increase wasn't significant.

Well, it's related to me.

This can't be blamed on Marquis Lanshan!

It's because my path is too weak, which instead limits their strength. Otherwise, Marquis Lanshan would be a true top-tier Heavenly King, close to a Heavenly Sovereign!

While Su Yu was still assessing, over there, Fat Ball let out a howl. The blackened Fat Ball, incredibly powerful, was now skewered along with its boots by a giant fork, causing it to cry out in pain.

So painful!

The undead giant grew stronger, wielding the giant fork, skewering Fat Ball, who roared in agony, while the undead giant stepped forward, seemingly intending to skewer March and the others as well!

"Continue!"

Su Yu glanced over, frowning slightly, and shouted, "Next!"

The three Heavenly Sovereigns were clearly no match for the undead giant at this moment.

It should be noted that the three Heavenly Sovereigns weren't weak. Moreover, Fat Ball was equivalent to two of them. Previously, the three Heavenly Sovereigns fought against four undead Heavenly Sovereigns without falling behind, but now, they were being miserably beaten by this undead giant.

Clearly, the giant's strength was growing, surpassing Su Yu.

Su Yu didn't concern himself with those matters. At this moment, he felt his own path's power growing stronger, his world expanding. Below, a large number of strong individuals were forcibly attacking the undead path, weakening its power.

Originally, his world was ten thousand meters in radius. Last time, with many strong individuals merging paths, it expanded more than tenfold. Now, with Marquis Lanshan's integration, it expanded again, and Su Yu himself was also expanding his world, encroaching on the undead realm's territory!

Reborn!

At this moment, everyone looked at Marquis Lanshan, who had merged with the Long Halberd Dao, and was somewhat astonished. She was truly reborn!

Yes, at this moment, everyone saw it!

In Su Yu's world, in the sky, a valiant female warrior, holding a long halberd, clad in fiery red armor, with a blood-red cape fluttering in the wind, indeed looked heroic!

She appeared very young!

When Marquis Lanshan didn't speak or smile, she was indeed a beauty.

However... at this moment, Marquis Lanshan, with one hand on her long halberd and the other on her waist, laughed wildly, her laughter crude and unrestrained. No matter how good-looking, no one could see it.

"Hahaha!"

"Hahahahaha!"

"..."

Marquis Lanshan's laughter echoed through the heavens and earth. She was about to go mad with laughter. I am the first undead to be reborn in this world!

She was just short of saying, let me put my hands on my hips and show off for a bit!

"Your Majesty, does my marquis attire look good?"

Marquis Lanshan laughed, "This was personally delivered to the Death Realm by Lord Martial King for me to wear! Your Majesty, if I can be crowned king, could you craft a Lanshan King attire for me?"

Su Yu glanced at her, too lazy to respond.

This fellow, now reborn, her demeanor had changed. Previously, she didn't seem so flamboyant, but today, it was evident she was quite flamboyant!

Before, her expressions weren't obvious, but now... they were very obvious!

At this moment, the undead giant also glanced down, saying indifferently, "Lanshan King attire, I don't think Su Yu will have the chance. Lanshan burial attire, however, might be possible!"

His aura grew stronger, gazing at all directions, and he said coldly, "Are you all going to defy me as well?"

He was looking at several top-tier undead powerhouses.

The North King, the Undead Emperor, Dragonblood Marquis.

Were these guys all going to defy orders?

The Undead Emperor closed his eyes, pretending not to hear. He was a smart person. At this moment, he wouldn't make a sound. Whether it was Su Yu or this undead giant, they could fight it out themselves!

He wouldn't help Su Yu, and Su Yu wouldn't blame him. That was expected.

He wouldn't help the undead giant either... this giant wasn't the true body of the Lord of the Undead, so he wasn't too afraid.

If the true body came... well, there would be no need for him to help; Su Yu would be killed instantly!

...

In the distance, the North King was still controlling several Daofuse subordinates.

At this moment, this group of undead was trembling with fear.

What to do?

Helping the undead giant was too risky, to be honest. Previously, so many strong individuals on Dizhi Luo's side were wiped out. Who wouldn't be afraid?

But helping Su Yu was also impossible!

They had no chance of revival. As undead, they were still subject to the control of the undead path!

The North King had a complicated expression.

Now, in the Death Realm, many undead powerhouses had been killed, and others were being revived.

Only he, Dragonblood, and the Undead Emperor were truly undead in the purest sense. However... they had also defied the will of the Lord of the Undead, even if it was just a remnant will.

The Death Realm was no longer pure!

Su Yu's arrival had thrown the entire Death Realm into chaos.

The North King glanced at the battle over there, then suddenly looked at the Daofuse beside him and sighed, "You can either follow the undead giant now, be cautious, and you might not die! Or, you can go to Su Yu now. Revival might not be possible, but Su Yu has taken many undead powerhouses. If he wants to control the Death Realm, he will need true undead powerhouses!"

Everyone looked at him, and one undead Daofuse couldn't help but ask, "Then... what about you, my lord?"

"Me?"

The North King smiled self-deprecatingly, "I was never a decisive person. If I were decisive, none of this would have happened! In life, I was timid and indecisive, leading to my death. In death, I remain the same... The East King approached me, urging me to join forces, but I refused!"

"The West King approached me, and I refused again!"

"The South King also approached me, and I still refused..."

"Whether to ally with the Human Race or oppose them, it's all a choice. However, my only desire was to establish myself as a king... yet I lacked the strength, the opportunity, the courage... People like me are perhaps what others call ambitious but lacking in talent!"

He opposed the Human Race and the myriad races, not for the sake of opposition, but because he wanted to establish himself, to be his own king, to close the door and have everyone leave him alone, to let him be the king.

But he didn't have the strength or talent for it, which is why he described himself as ambitious but lacking in talent!

Not wanting to join any side requires strength to support it!

He didn't have it!

"You all make your own choices. I won't hinder your future. As for me..."

North King gazed into the distance, towards the Celestial River of Death, a river specifically meant to guide the dead. He chuckled, "I wish to retreat into seclusion, but I wonder if there's still a place for me here. This Death Realm no longer has room for me!"

The Land of the Abyss was no longer safe either!

With Su Yu's involvement and the impending unsealing of the Undead Emperor, what choices did he have left?

As he spoke, blood suddenly spurted from his mouth. The figure of Dragonblood Marquis gradually emerged, speaking softly, "My lord, the world has changed. So... you should just rest easy!"

At that moment, the surrounding Daofuse cultivators were all shocked!

Dragonblood Marquis appeared, his claw piercing through North King's death mark, continuously absorbing his power. At this moment, Dragonblood Marquis seemed somewhat sinister. He looked at the distant battle in the sky, smiling with a wicked grin.

"What a splendid show!"

The other Daofuse cultivators wanted to flee, but he caught them instantly, the sound of his claws piercing through death marks echoing continuously.

Dragonblood Marquis chuckled, "Today truly is a grand performance!"

"Some die, some resurrect, but in the end, there are hardly any true powerhouses left in this Death Realm!"

North King's gaze was somewhat unfocused. He said nothing, merely looking over there. After a long while, he suddenly spoke, "Dragonblood, in this era, there are always those who think themselves clever, but in the end, they are merely played with like pawns..."

Dragonblood Marquis laughed, "My lord, are you referring to me?"

He crushed North King's death mark, continuously devouring his source power.

North King suddenly smiled, then sighed, "Perhaps... only you truly wish to be this undead! Dragonblood, you're not wrong. In this realm, you are the one who truly deserves to be king! Because... this is the Death Realm! Only you relish it, while we... we still wish to be alive!"

His aura grew increasingly faint, his eyes somewhat lost. "I actually don't want to be undead, don't want to be this Heavenly King, this North Heavenly King... none of it is what I desire. What I truly want is just a peaceful life."

"Better to be a dog in peacetime than a person in chaos!"

North King smiled, his figure beginning to fade, sighing, "Dragonblood, you wish to be the king of the undead, but the road ahead is fraught with obstacles. You've had it too easy. Your changes, I've seen them... don't you find it abrupt? For years, there was no change, and now your strength grows rapidly, as if aided by the heavens..."

"You don't understand!"

Dragonblood Marquis sneered, "North King, you're truly old. You've become too complacent! You don't understand that in this era, there are beings beyond your imagination! My fortune, my talent, everything is a gift from the true master of the undead!"

"And the one before you is merely a spiritual imprint, as Su Yu said, not the true body!"

"In terms of identity, he might not even compare to me. I am the master of this world! The true master of the undead has chosen me, do you understand?"

North King struggled to turn his head, looking at Dragonblood, his figure increasingly faint, yet his eyes grew clearer. Suddenly, he coughed up blood and laughed, "You... what are you? Dragonblood... you're... so mediocre! Who can you compare to? The Human Emperor? Su Yu? Or the Culture King, Martial King? Do you really think you're more talented than us four Heavenly Kings?"

He coughed up black blood, his smile radiant, "You... are still too young. You... truly don't deserve it. It's not because you killed me that I say this, but I hope you can see yourself clearly... Dragonblood, see yourself clearly, you still have a chance. If not... your end won't be good!"

"Too bad... you won't see it!"

Dragonblood Marquis laughed!

What are you?

What you say, is it true?

You say I'm unworthy, but are you worthy?

Ridiculous!

...

Meanwhile, both the undead giant and Su Yu sensed something was amiss with North King!

Just as Dragonblood Marquis said North King wouldn't see it, Su Yu suddenly cursed, "Damn, I've been waiting forever!"

"..."

The three Heavenly Sovereigns, who were nearly beaten to death, turned to look at him in confusion. At this moment, Fat Ball had become a blood ball, looking bewildered. What do you mean you've been waiting forever?

Su Yu grumbled, "So slow!"

I've been waiting for you to make a move against North King, and you just now did it!

It's really frustrating!

Dragonblood Marquis, who had just advanced to Heavenly Sovereign, killed North King and those Daofuse cultivators, his power surging, and Su Yu could feel it!

However, he was still far from becoming a master of laws.

But at this moment, Su Yu didn't care. He was at his limit, and Dragonblood couldn't improve further in a short time!

Unless he went to kill the Undead Emperor, but was that possible?

Impossible!

This child of destiny should fulfill his mission now!

The undead giant was growing stronger and was becoming a real problem.

Especially now, Su Yu needed to oversee the resurrection. How could he have time to deal with the undead giant? Wasn't it troublesome?

As Dragonblood Marquis devoured North King, Su Yu shouted!

In the Celestial River of Death, a massive droplet of source power appeared, revealing a small page within. This was the undead page Su Yu had buried earlier, infused with one of his divine characters, the character for death, truly integrated!

"Return to my Great Dao!"

A low shout, and the next moment, that source power flew swiftly towards Su Yu.

Simultaneously, Su Yu roared, "True body, descend!"

Boom!

A muffled sound echoed through the heavens and earth. The next moment, everyone saw a scene: Dragonblood Marquis, still holding North King, suddenly appeared in the undead Great Dao.

At this moment, Dragonblood Marquis was momentarily stunned.

The undead giant also frowned slightly.

And North King, with his last breath, suddenly looked at Su Yu, then at the source power, then at the page within, and suddenly... laughed!

"Hahaha!"

His laughter shook the heavens and earth. Never in his life had he laughed so heartily, so joyfully.

Laughing to death!

I see it now!

Dragonblood... this fool, indeed, I said it, this change came too quickly, coinciding with Su Yu's arrival, indeed, it was all Su Yu's doing.

Dragonblood Marquis was dumbfounded. What did this mean?

He looked at Su Yu. Why did I suddenly appear here?

And Su Yu, pressed for time, hurriedly said, "Don't ask, asking is useless. You're my son—no, even if you were my son, I'd be disgusted. You say you're the child of destiny, destiny is me—no, Destiny Marquis isn't me, forget it, saying more is pointless, quickly merge with the source!"

Dragonblood Marquis's face changed, and he roared in anger, "Su Yu, you're courting death!"

"Shut up!"

No time to deal with you, I'm in a hurry!

He quickly forced that source power to merge with Dragonblood Marquis. Dragonblood Marquis wanted to resist but couldn't move. At this moment, he seemed to realize something, suddenly furious, "You... the undead path I merged with..."

"I created it!"

Su Yu sneered, "Nonsense, with your demeanor, if I didn't give you opportunities, where would you get them? Quickly merge, merge, let's see if you can become a master of laws. If not, it's fine, close enough is good, I'm busy, hurry!"

"Impossible!"

Dragonblood Marquis went mad, "Impossible, I'm the true heir chosen by the master of the undead, Su Yu, you liar..."

"Shut up, you think I don't have more potential than the master of the undead?"

"Recognizing him as your father, is there a difference from recognizing me?"

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him, reaching out to grab him. Dragonblood Marquis was about to explode when—boom!

The Great Dao fluctuated violently, and he completely lost control over it!

Without the power of the Great Dao, what was he?

Nothing!

In the blink of an eye, Su Yu grabbed him, taking the source water with a bright smile, "Good, eat it!"

At this moment, Su Yu transformed into some strange entity, feeding Dragonblood Marquis... feeding him source water!

"No... Su Yu... you..."

"Shut up, eat it!"

Su Yu punched his mouth open, forcing the source water in. Not only that, but Su Yu gritted his teeth, merging the page into him as well, sighing, fearing that if he withdrew it, Dragonblood Marquis would weaken, which wouldn't be good!

With this integration, Dragonblood Marquis's aura instantly grew stronger!

In the blink of an eye, from just entering Heavenly Sovereign, he reached an extreme, almost surpassing Su Yu.

"Su Yu!"

Dragonblood Marquis struggled violently, but his Great Dao power was out of control, and Su Yu ignored him. Under the shocked gazes of others, he kneaded Dragonblood Marquis, and soon, Dragonblood Marquis couldn't make a sound, only struggling frantically.

His aura grew stronger!

Over there, the undead giant, battling the three Heavenly Sovereigns, suddenly stopped, looking at Su Yu, coldly asking, "What are you doing?"

"Don't you know?"

Su Yu laughed, "Your appearance is because I extracted a large amount of undead source power! But... look, I've contributed my own undead source power. I let Dragonblood kill so many powerhouses, he stored quite a bit of source power... I'm now putting him entirely into the Great Dao, so there's no reason, no excuse for you to continue reviving!"

Su Yu laughed brightly, "Fighting with a spiritual imprint like yours, even if I win, there's no benefit, right? If I lose, people die, so why bother? Since that's the case, I take as much as I give back, you should leave, right?"

Su Yu laughed heartily, "Look, he's so strong!"

"Look, he's almost a true master of laws!"

"Also, this page contains my own insights into the undead Great Dao, I've filled it all in, stuffed it into the source of the undead Great Dao, isn't that enough? Of course, if the master of the undead doesn't notice before returning, I'll steal his Great Dao!"

At this moment, Su Yu's smile was incredibly sly!

"Brother, I don't want to engage in a fierce battle with a machine, causing heavy losses to my subordinates. You should just go back. Farewell!"

The next moment, the Dragonblood Marquis let out a roar filled with unwillingness, anger, despair, and madness as he flew towards the giant undead. His aura grew increasingly powerful, terrifyingly so!

Su Yu shouted, "Fat Ball, you all retreat!"

The three Heavenly Sovereigns were all aghast at this moment!

They fled in panic!

As they escaped, Giant Axe and March cursed inwardly.

What kind of world is this?

They had just fought the Master of Rules, or rather, been beaten by him. Now, another powerhouse close to the Master of Rules realm was about to self-destruct because of Su Yu. This world is too terrifying.

Is this still the lower realm?

Is this still the Death Realm?

Why does it feel more intense than the battles in the Upper Realm? Not a single Heavenly Sovereign has fallen there, but here, many have already perished!

Now, even these two, who are considered to be at the Master of Rules level, are about to fall?

Truly terrifying!

The giant undead did not stop them from escaping, nor did he stop the Dragonblood Marquis from flying over. With a sense of calm, as the Dragonblood Marquis approached, he asked, "Su Yu, in your opinion, what is the gap between me and the true Master of the Undead?"

Su Yu smiled, "A lot!"

"Could you enlighten me?"

The giant undead inquired.

Su Yu laughed, "First, strength!"

"Second, wisdom! You seem wise, but in reality, it's all imitation, a program. You have no emotions of your own; you're just a program. When the Master of the Undead needs to activate you, you can only follow the program he set!"

"Third, adaptability! You can only follow the instructions; you have no adaptability..."

"Fourth, courage!"

"Fifth..."

As Su Yu continued, the Dragonblood Marquis had already reached the giant's side. The giant showed a thoughtful expression, and Su Yu suddenly laughed, "Look, you're doing well now. You're actually thinking... Maybe... you really want to become the next Master of the Undead. But after all, you're just an imprint. Of course, an imprint isn't without opportunities! However, if I were you, the first thing I'd do is change my name to avoid confusion with the Master of the Undead!"

Su Yu grinned, "How about I give you a name?"

The giant undead looked at Su Yu. At this moment, he did not retreat. Even if he left, when the Dragonblood Marquis exploded and filled the Celestial River of Death, he would almost disappear too!

"Please enlighten me!"

He politely asked, should I have my own name?

Su Yu smiled, "Master of the Undead!"

Su Yu chuckled, "The other is the Master of the Undead, and you can be the Master of the Undead. I think, even if you disappear this time, the imprint remains. Just secretly steal a bit of the Death Path's power now and then, turning it into your Undead Path! When the Master of the Undead returns, hehe... it's gone, the Death Path has become yours. By then, you'll be the Master of the Undead!"

The giant undead pondered, while the others remained silent.

Wow!

Su Yu is so shameless, actually encouraging the avatar of the Master of the Undead to rebel. Can he act like a human?

The giant undead... no, perhaps he should be called the Master of the Undead now. With a thoughtful expression, he skewered the Dragonblood Marquis on his fork, pondering, "Master of the Undead? Friend Su... what is the difference between the undead and the undead?"

Su Yu laughed, "The difference in death is quite significant! Death, when humans talk about it, often means the destruction of the physical body. Humans also have a saying, 'the body dies, but the spirit does not perish!' This is what the Master of the Undead pursues!"

"And extinction is an extreme, a true annihilation, where both body and spirit perish!"

Su Yu laughed, "A pure death, an extreme death, that's extinction! True undead are actually void! The true path of death is more extreme, more so than death!"

At this moment, not only him, but the others who heard this were also slightly dazed.

Is that so?

It seems... somewhat reasonable.

Is extinction purer and more extreme than death?

At this moment, the Master of the Undead's eyes flickered, "So, the undead is more extreme and stronger than the undead?"

Su Yu laughed, "It depends on the individual. It's not like a knife is necessarily stronger than a gun, or vice versa. It depends on how you cultivate and comprehend, right?"

"What you say makes sense... Thank you for your guidance, friend!"

"Then I... shall be called the Master of the Undead!"

He suddenly smiled, looking at the Dragonblood Marquis, "Today, I also want to experience what true annihilation is!"

"Come on!"

Boom!

In the midst of the Dragonblood Marquis's madness, he didn't need to self-destruct. The Master of the Undead suddenly pulled the Dragonblood Marquis along and self-destructed together.

"Damn your ancestors!"

The Dragonblood Marquis's madness, unwillingness, anger, and grievance that wanted to tear the river apart, echoed in a final, mournful roar!

As for who he was cursing?

It's hard to say!

Most likely Su Yu, with a small chance of being the Master of the Undead.

Meanwhile, the people of the South King were all shaken, looking at Su Yu, then at the tumultuous waves in the Death Path, all deeply shocked. Is this even possible?

But Su Yu just watched silently, frowning slightly, and after a long time, he laughed, "He... could he really comprehend something about the path of the undead? I was just talking nonsense, but... it feels like he might have really gained some insight!"

The Master of the Undead, in the last moment, might have truly gained something.

How bizarre!

As for his self-destruction, it made no difference to Su Yu. If he didn't self-destruct, the Dragonblood Marquis would have to.

It was just a matter of who went first!

And in this self-destruction, the long-ignored North King also completely perished, with a sense of loss, relief, and indescribable emotion.

Indeed, this world still belongs to these cunning individuals.

They plot and scheme endlessly, never tiring!

Dragonblood, that brute, thought he was the child of destiny, how laughable. Even the North King thought he was overthinking it, not expecting Dragonblood to go before him. His recent pride turned into a joke!

Of course, since he's dead, let it be a joke!

The North King no longer felt regret, disappearing from this world with laughter.

In the end, he was completely relieved!

I never had the heart of a ruler, the strength of a ruler, or the cunning of a ruler, so perhaps my death was inevitable.

The era of the Four Heavenly Kings has ended.

"The era of the Four Heavenly Kings... ends today!"

The North King left his final words!

With the fall of the East, West, and North Kings, and the imminent revival of the South King, the era of the four kings from ancient times has completely ended, marking the end of ancient rule in the Death Realm!

This Death Realm now belongs to Su!

In the Ink Path, the South King watched silently, saying nothing.

Yes, the era of the Four Heavenly Kings has ended!

The waves are towering!

In the Death Realm, the great path trembled violently, and the entire Celestial River of Death was in turmoil, even affecting the entire River of Time. The two are connected!

This time, the tremor was incredibly intense!

...

At this moment.

Deep within the River of Time.

First, the tremor from Lanshan's revival drew everyone's attention to the shadow.

Someone muttered, "Did the Martial Emperor die again?"

"......"

The shadow of the Human Emperor felt that this guy was implying something about him.

Twice now!

The first time, he said the Martial Emperor was killed, the second time, he said the Martial Emperor's sea of will was destroyed, completely perishing.

So now, the third tremor... what does it represent?

Clearly, everyone thought it might not be the Martial Emperor this time. Of course, they were idle, so implying something about their leader was a form of amusement.

The shadow thought for a moment. Since these guys said so, if he didn't provide an explanation, it would be a disservice to them.

He thought for a while and calmly said, "The Martial Emperor has died again!"

"......"

Everyone fell silent, waiting for His Majesty the Human Emperor to give them a reasonable and perfect explanation. How did the Martial Emperor die this time?

Let's hear it!

The shadow calmly said, "The first time, the physical body perished! The second time, the sea of will perished! The third time, after becoming an undead, he was quickly captured and killed by someone with great strength, causing a disturbance in the Celestial River of Death, which in turn affected the River of Time!"

"......"

This... who would believe this?

Someone chuckled, "Your Majesty, the Martial Emperor is not weak, but after becoming an undead, can his death cause the entire Celestial River of Death to tremble? Even affecting the entire River of Time, is that possible?"

The shadow sneered, "Ignorance is fearless! The River of Time and the Celestial River of Death are actually connected. You don't even know this, and yet you dare to speak nonsense, denying everything I say!"

Alright, the Human Emperor can always turn the dead into the living, to the point where even the Culture King and others have to compromise. Fine, you have the final say!

However, when the fourth tremor came, this time with a seemingly endless feeling, everyone was stunned, looking at the shadow of the Human Emperor.

Go on!

You said the undead avatar died the third time, what about the fourth time?

Someone chuckled, "Could it be... the Martial Emperor can die four times? Your Majesty, how about a different explanation this time, who died?"

The shadow silently looked at him, and after a long pause, said, "Still the Martial Emperor!"

"......"

Everyone stifled their laughter!

This... His Majesty is so determined to win this argument that he's even willing to forgo his dignity!

Still the Martial Emperor?

Shame on you!

He's died three times already, even the undead is gone, tell us, how is there a fourth time?

The shadow calmly said, "This tremor is connected to the previous one, not far apart in time! I speculate that previously, only the undead of the Martial Emperor died, but the source of the undead was not destroyed. This time, the source of the undead was destroyed, causing the Celestial River of Death to tremble!"

Among the crowd, someone was puzzled, "The source of the undead?"

"Of course, those who are ignorant should not refute me!"

Chapter 801: The Endless Deaths of the Martial Emperor

In the depths of the Death Path, a shadowy figure spoke calmly, "The undead have both an origin and a true form. Anyone who has delved deeply into the Death Path would know this. Those who don't probably aren't qualified to discuss this with me!"

At this, someone chimed in, "His Majesty is right. The undead indeed consist of two parts."

"Really? Radiant King, you're not just saying that to save face for His Majesty, are you?"

"Of course not!" Radiant King chuckled, "There's no need for that. In fact, I'm not the only one who knows this. If you don't believe me, ask those who've been to the Celestial River of Death!"

Soon, others voiced their agreement, "There is indeed talk of an origin."

Well, those who previously doubted the Human Emperor now had nothing to say.

This... there was no way to refute it.

The Human Emperor spoke with authority: the first time, it was the physical body; the second time, the sea of will; the third time, the true form of the undead; the fourth time, the origin of the undead...

Good heavens, the Martial Emperor had died four times, each time causing a stir in the River of Time. This was no ordinary feat!

Someone joked, "If there's a fifth time, that would be interesting!"

The crowd nearly burst into laughter. Indeed, if even the origin was destroyed, what explanation would His Majesty give for a fifth time?

And just at that moment, the fifth wave came!

At this moment, in the Death Realm, Su Yu had awakened the South King. This wave was even more intense than the one caused by the awakening of King Lanshan, shaking the entire river more violently than before!

Now, everyone turned to the shadow.

Go on!

A fifth time, if you can still say the Martial Emperor died and give a reason, we'll truly be convinced!

At this moment, the shadow turned to look behind him, his eyes filled with a strange expression.

Which rascal is causing trouble all day long?

Are you not done with me?

"Has the Heaven Opening begun? Is it some Heaven Opening brat causing trouble all day?"

That was a possibility!

The Human Emperor made a judgment: it must be some Heaven Opening brat constantly causing disturbances, otherwise, the River of Time wouldn't be shaking all day.

This rascal, so troublesome!

He turned his back to the crowd, pondered for a moment, and continued, "The Martial Emperor has died again!"

"..."

Everyone silently waited to hear how the Martial Emperor died this time.

"The explosion of the undead origin doesn't mean the Martial Emperor can't die..."

The shadow pondered for a moment and suddenly said, "Yes, this time, it's because the Martial Emperor's Heaven Gate has completely exploded. Previously, even in death, the Heaven Gate still existed, so he was technically alive. But with the Heaven Gate's explosion, this counts as a complete fall!"

Someone chuckled, "Your Majesty, does that mean the Martial Emperor won't die a sixth time?"

Alright, you passed the fifth time!

But if there's a sixth wave, what will you say?

The shadow remained silent. Would there be a sixth time?

There should be...

As for when, he wasn't sure.

The next moment, he knew—the sixth time seemed to have arrived!

Forget it, I can't find a reason!

Since I can't find one... let's not let there be a sixth time!

The shadow said calmly, "There won't be a sixth time. This time, the Martial Emperor is truly dead!"

"I'm going to take a look at the front... you all continue to defend. I'll see how much longer until we can return to the Myriad Realms!"

He stepped into the air and quickly reached the front. In the next moment, he stomped down, suppressing the sixth wave, which wasn't too strong, with one foot!

Hmm, that's good!

No need to think about how the Martial Emperor dies a sixth time!

A bunch of guys, still trying to outsmart me? Can I lose to you?

Heh!

I will never lose!

The seventh time, the eighth time, bring it on, I'm not afraid. I'll stomp them all flat!

However, when he had this thought, waves continued to appear, and he could handle them calmly. But when the final, extremely intense wave appeared, the shadow suddenly jumped.

"Damn!"

A loud shout echoed in all directions!

The shadow's aura suddenly changed, a powerful energy surged through the river!

The shadow's eyes widened, widened, widened!

He looked into the distance!

Damn, did I feel it wrong?

Xingyue... has been resurrected?

"Damn!"

Another loud shout, the shadow was incredibly shocked. How could this be!

A strong practitioner comprehending the Great Dao of Life and Death?

No, the master of the Myriad Realms without rules!

Who is it!

Damn it, did the Martial Emperor open the heavens?

I refuse to believe it!
