Chapter 829: Surprises Await (10,000 Words for Subscription)

The New Era of Xingyu, a different era from the time of the Human Emperor!

If everything relied on the Human Emperor's people, it would only be considered an inheritance, a continuation, not a creation. Su Yu didn't have many thoughts on this matter. However, upon realizing that the Human Emperor might not make it, that he was nearing his end, Su Yu understood that some preparations were indeed necessary. Since Xia Huyou and the others were ready to go all out, Su Yu was willing to join them in this madness!

...

While others were diligently cultivating, within the River of Time, Su Yu was quite generous. With a wave of his hand, he declared, "Pick whichever you like!"

It was as if he were saying, "This is the empire I've built; feel free to choose a place to establish your kingdom!" His audacity was taken seriously by the others.

At this moment, Xia Huyou squinted and smiled, "I want the Human Race's Path of the Flesh!"

That was formidable! Mastering the Path of the Flesh, while not directly becoming an existence like the Human Ancestor, Su Yu judged that reaching the first tier wouldn't be too difficult. The Human Emperor was first tier before the opening of the heavens, but the path he mastered might not be as powerful as the Human Ancestor's Path of the Flesh.

This Path of the Flesh, even now, was the strongest path Su Yu had seen. As for the Heaven Opener, that's a different story altogether. The Human Race's Path of the Flesh... forget it. The Human Ancestor might not have abandoned it, just like the Culture King, who directly discarded it. It might not have been abandoned, making it impossible to fully grasp this path.

Ignoring Xia Huyou's words, Su Yu continued, "If we're talking about powerful paths, the Pen Dao is not weak! Even the Martial Emperor, with his martial path, hasn't reached the strength of the Pen Dao, yet he can enter the second tier. If one fully masters the Pen Dao, they might step into the first tier!"

Although Su Yu didn't think much of the Pen Dao, it was the main path cultivated by the Culture King. The Culture King's opening of the heavens was unknown, but he was said to be a first-tier ruler of laws, which means fully mastering the Pen Dao is essentially first tier!

That's terrifying! It shows that the first tier division back then was just that. The Human Ancestor mastered the Path of the Flesh, and if we go by the divisions back then, it should be more than first tier.

Unfortunately, the Pen Dao is genuinely difficult to master! Even Su Yu spent considerable effort, refining 99 characters, breaking down the path, and only then merging with it, yet he didn't reach full mastery.

At that time, Su Yu merged about 90% and stopped, and even then, he could contend with a Heavenly Venerable.

Thinking of this, Su Yu suddenly said, "Wujiang, Yuncheng, esteemed seniors..."

The two looked at Su Yu, who pondered and said, "Both of you have mastered many characters, all inherited from the Culture King... I think perhaps... you two could try cultivating this path together!"

Su Yu thought for a moment and added, "The Pen Dao is not weak. One person's strength might not be enough to master it, and even if it is, it would take too long. Both of you, like me, are inheritors of the Culture King. Why not cultivate together? For instance, I master these characters' powers, and you master those... Of course, this requires extremely high coordination!"

The Pen Dao is too strong. Even though Su Yu extracted a lot of its power, it might have fully recovered by now.

Nan Wujiang was silent for a while before speaking, "You mean, Yuncheng and I should become the spirits of the Pen Dao?"

Su Yu nodded, "Yes, if you two can master the Pen Dao, even if only jointly, you might possess the power of a first-tier ruler of laws. Separately, I think you might also reach the second tier!"

Just like the Path of the Flesh, many strong individuals have claimed kingship through it.

Yuncheng's eyes flickered, "If my teacher and I jointly take charge, can we quickly master the Pen Dao?"

"There shouldn't be a problem. You're both inheritors of the Culture King, and he might still have some residual control. But sensing your presence, he likely won't obstruct you!"

Moreover, even if he wanted to obstruct, he might not be able to.

The Culture King is still inside the Heaven Gate!

Su Yu suddenly smiled, "Let's settle it like this. This path suits you both well! You've been cultivating for many years, essentially preparing for this path. If you don't mind, you could include Senior Xia Chen, and the three of you could take charge together. I believe the speed would be even faster!"

Xia Chen, a figure from the first generation of the Cultural Research Academy!

The Culture Tomb was brought out by Xia Chen, and he also cultivated the character combat techniques of the Culture Tomb. After his revival, he has been recovering, and at this moment, Xia Chen was also in the group.

He wasn't part of this tide, but he was a Xia family member, and the Xia family was involved in all this. Xia Chen had no objections.

At this moment, hearing Su Yu's suggestion, Xia Chen thought for a moment and said, "Your Majesty, after my revival, I integrated into Your Majesty's world. Now, separating again... might be difficult. I might be rejected, so let's forget it."

Su Yu pondered and nodded, "That's possible! But it's not necessarily impossible. It might be doable, but the River of Time might have some repelling force!"

"Then Your Majesty need not disturb the River of Time for me!"

He looked at Nan Wujiang and said slowly, "Wujiang should be able to do it!"

Nan Wujiang was his student. He was the first generation principal, and Nan Wujiang was the third generation principal, yet he was his student. The second generation principal was a strong figure from the Beast Taming Department.

He had great faith in this student and said, "Wujiang's talent is actually excellent. It's just that when I first encountered the Culture Tomb, I didn't know much about characters, and it was like groping in the dark, which delayed Wujiang! At that time, since I accepted Wujiang, it was because I thought his talent was good and he could inherit the Culture King's legacy..."

It was quite unfortunate. Even then, he didn't understand much about it and could only teach in a haphazard manner. That Nan Wujiang could cultivate to this point was already quite fortunate.

Su Yu considered for a moment and didn't say much more. He quickly said, "Then let's head to the Pen Dao area first. Wujiang, Yuncheng, esteemed seniors... this time, truly merging with the path means becoming spirits. Ordinary merging won't work; you can't quickly master the path. Only by completely integrating with the path can you succeed..."

At this critical moment, Su Yu still reminded them.

This matter, though it sounded simple, if it were Su Yu, he wouldn't do it.

Losing one's physical body and becoming part of the path is quite awkward!

Becoming like Doubao and the others is actually a rather sad affair. Back then, Bai Feng and Wu Lan wanted to do this, but Su Yu didn't agree. Now Bai Feng isn't here, and Liu Wenyan and the others have been hidden away by Su Yu.

Maoqiu was Su Yu's chosen guardian.

When heading upstream, Su Yu most likely wouldn't take Maoqiu with him.

It would stay behind to guard the house!

At this moment, Nan Wujiang showed a slight smile, "It's fine. If we become spirits, so be it. The physical body... when valued, it's incredibly important. When not, it's something that can be given up!"

Yuncheng also said softly, "My teacher and I, back then, chose to hide in the shadows rather than face the enemy head-on. We have no face to show the world, so this face is dispensable!"

He was a teacher in place of his master, essentially Wan Tiansheng's teacher, though nominally the senior brother.

However, even now, Wan Tiansheng was polite to him and Nan Wujiang, but not as close as before. During that period, they chose to fake their deaths, and Wan Tiansheng was still quite lost.

Later, when Ye Batian died in battle, Wan Tiansheng silently carried the multi-character department on his own. When Yuncheng and Nan Wujiang appeared, Wan Tiansheng harbored resentment, though he rarely mentioned it now.

Su Yu didn't bring it up much either, as it was somewhat removed from him. Strictly speaking, Nan Wujiang helped Su Yu a lot when he infiltrated the Hunting Pavilion, but because Old Wan wasn't very close, Su Yu didn't express much closeness either.

At this moment, he thought for a moment and said, "Merging with the path, everything starts anew. Once dead, all debts are cleared. I'll talk to Principal Wan! You two hid in the shadows only to find an opportunity to prove your path... I can't say much about it, but it's different from Hundred Battles!"

The two didn't say much more. Bringing it up now held little meaning.

Soon, Su Yu led them into the Pen Dao area. The Pen Dao, as always, was vast.

Su Yu probed a bit and found that the power he had previously extracted had mostly recovered. His world also contained the Pen Dao, but compared to this place, it was like a small witch meeting a great witch!

At this moment, everyone looked at Su Yu, wondering how to merge with the path and become spirits.

Su Yu said solemnly, "Reveal all your characters!"

Quickly, the two manifested many characters, forming two character combat techniques!

Both had numerous characters, and together, they had over 50.

Su Yu examined them and quickly said, "Merging with the path to become spirits is something I'm doing for the first time, but I have some understanding from Doubao and the others!"

He looked at the two and said solemnly, "Your lives, your seas of will, even everything, must merge into the character combat techniques. Use the characters, distributed throughout the entire path, to control the powerful path's power with the incomplete rules of the characters. However, during this process, there is a significant danger... it's easy to be eroded by the path's power and become a part of it, at which point you won't be spirits of the path but... a part of the path, completely dead!"

"Only by retaining your consciousness and using the weak power of the characters to control the path can you become spirits of the path!"

"During this process, you two must coordinate well. Not only must you coordinate well, but you also need incredibly strong willpower! Be tenacious. When the path's power impacts you, you'll feel death... in the truest sense. If you fail, you will surely die!"

Beside them, Xia Huyou chuckled, "Your Majesty, don't scare the esteemed seniors."

Su Yu didn't say anything. He wasn't scaring them; everyone understood!

Wanting to rapidly increase strength isn't that simple!

However, Su Yu still said, "This path, both the Culture King and I have cultivated. The aura of this path recognizes our lineage! That's the only advantage!"

The two exchanged glances, and Nan Wujiang smiled, "So, if we succeed, we might quickly master the Pen Dao?"

"Yes!"

"Does the potential of the pen dao surpass that of the average dao?"

"Of course!"

Nan Wujiang chuckled, "Good, as expected of our own people, as expected of our Multi-Character Department. Even at this time, you know how to choose a good path for us! Other daos, once mastered, can only reach the level of a fourth-tier ruler of laws, right?"

"Yes!" Su Yu nodded. That was indeed the case. However, the difficulty was significantly lower.

The stronger the dao, the greater the impact on both of them.

Nan Wujiang took a deep breath and smiled, "Alright! Su Yu, send us into the pen dao. We know what to do!"

At this moment, he called out to Su Yu.

Su Yu glanced at the two, remained silent for a moment, then reached out with his hand. The river seemed to pause under his grasp, and a gap appeared in the pen dao. Su Yu grabbed the two of them and flew directly toward the pen dao!

At the entrance of the pen dao, Su Yu set them down and said solemnly, "If you really can't handle it..."

"That's not going to happen!" Nan Wujiang laughed, "Xuan Jiu, your grandfather is no coward! I still have a few words to explain about what happened back then!"

At this moment, Nan Wujiang laughed, "Back then, after my master Xia Chen fell, the Multi-Character Department went from prosperity to decline. The Myriad Races seemed to have some intentions against us, including our Human Race. It was probably the Silk Destroying King... who might have been targeting us in secret. The Great Xia King sensed something unusual and ordered me to lie low! I only did so because of the Great Xia King's orders. So if there's blame, I won't bear it. Let the Great Xia King take the blame!"

"That old thing, now he's pushing everything away. He and Wan Tiansheng served in the same hall, and Wan Tiansheng is even stronger than him. That old thing is worried that Wan Tiansheng will cause him trouble, so he keeps quiet. Shameless old bastard!"

"Yun Chen too, Yun Chen actually suffered. He was the original cult leader for decades, even a century... all thanks to that grandson of the Great Xia King!"

Su Yu laughed. Above, in the river, Xia Huyou and Lord Xiahou were both grimacing. This... this isn't appropriate!

Who are you cursing?

Xia Chen also felt bitter, but Nan Wujiang didn't care. He laughed heartily, "My teacher Xia Chen is the ancestor of the Great Xia King. As his disciple, I am also the ancestor of the Great Xia King! The Xia family's seniority is very low. Calling him grandson is already elevating his status! Su Yu, if Yun Chen and I survive, consider today's words unsaid. If we die... tell Wan Tiansheng that it doesn't matter if he doesn't recognize me as his teacher. I didn't really teach him, but during Yun Chen's time, he truly treated him like a son. Now that Wan Tiansheng is like this... Yun Chen is still very disappointed..."

Yun Chen had been guiding Wan Tiansheng since he first entered school at the age of ten, teaching him for many years before he completely disappeared.

Now, Wan Tiansheng harbors resentment towards Yun Chen, and naturally, Yun Chen would feel disappointed.

Su Yu smiled and nodded, saying nothing more.

The next moment, the two entered the pen dao. Instantly, their physical bodies shattered, merging into the divine character combat skills. The two divine character combat skills rushed toward the end of the pen dao. As soon as they entered, others couldn't see, but with Su Yu's Heaven Gate open, he saw everything clearly!

A massive amount of the power of the pen dao surged against the two divine character combat skills, causing them to begin disintegrating!

Too powerful!

These two weren't strong enough, and forcibly merging would only lead to assimilation!

Su Yu took a deep breath. At this moment, the Heaven Gate suddenly appeared, and he shouted, "Culture King, lend me a hand to suppress the pen dao's disturbance!"

Boom!

The Heaven Gate suppressed!

At this moment, a vague shadow emerged from the pen dao. Su Yu snorted coldly, "I knew you were there! Last time, you tried to deceive me by saying there were no traps in the pen dao. As a scholar, you left no contingencies in your dao? I'd be a fool to believe you!"

Previously, when Su Yu visited the Culture King's Residence, a shadow of the Culture King appeared, telling Su Yu that he hadn't left anything behind, no contingencies, and that there were no traps in the pen dao. Su Yu didn't believe him at all!

Sure enough, today, as the pen dao was suppressed, the Culture King's shadow sensed it and emerged.

This shadow seemed somewhat mechanical, turning its back on all beings. Su Yu couldn't be bothered with its pretenses. Suddenly, he reached out, and 99 divine characters appeared, instantly forming an "↑."

"I am the inheritor of the pen dao. This dao belongs to me. You assist me in suppressing the pen dao!"

The shadow trembled slightly.

The next moment, laughter echoed, "My successor has arrived. Being able to discover me means you've reached a high level. I was only worried you couldn't control the pen dao back then..."

Clearly, this was still a program!

Most likely, it was a pretext to prevent the pen dao inheritor from discovering it. To hell with that!

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with it anymore, "Stop pretending, you fool. Can you even retort?"

The Culture King's shadow continued, "Being able to discover me means your control over the pen dao is already high. Very good, I'm very satisfied..."

"Idiot!"

"Very impressive!"

"Moron!"

"I'm glad I had faith in you!"

"..."

At this moment, what should have been a serious matter was turned into a joke by Su Yu, making everyone want to laugh. Su Yu, unperturbed, began recording, smirking, "When I meet the Culture King, I'll show him this. See how embarrassed he gets. I insult him, and he still praises me!"

"..."

Please, have some decency!

Everyone was speechless.

The Culture King... truly pitiful.

This was the Culture King's shadow, but unfortunately, it was too procedural, and now Su Yu was taking advantage of it.

"Seems like it's really just a program. What a pity!"

Su Yu's Heaven Gate trembled, and with a rumble, he shattered the Culture King's shadow. Forget it, better not let the Culture King control this. It would only cause delays. With the Culture King's shadow present, Yun Chen and the others would find it harder to merge!

Moreover, Su Yu didn't just shatter the Culture King's shadow; he discreetly extracted a shadow from the pen dao, one that belonged to him.

Meanwhile, on the river, everyone looked at each other... for a moment, they were all grimacing.

These... these scholars, truly not many good ones among them.

Su Yu cursed the Culture King for a while, and it turned out he himself had left a mark in the pen dao. Su Yu explained, "I just don't want outsiders to control the pen dao, so I left a little mark to prevent outsiders from taking advantage!"

Alright, no one said anything.

Stop cursing the Culture King. You're all birds of a feather!

...

At the same time.

Beyond the Heaven Gate.

In the endless void.

The Culture King's body trembled slightly, raising an eyebrow, "What's he doing now?"

Didn't he open the heavens last time?

He gave up on my pen dao, so why is he shattering my pen dao's shadow again?

Bored?

Beside him, the Martial King said in confusion, "I didn't do anything!"

"Not talking about you!"

"Then are you talking about your father?"

The Martial King retorted, "If you're not talking about me, then you're talking about your father?"

"..."

The Culture King wanted to kill him. This fool had learned to talk back!

He couldn't be bothered to respond, shaking his white robe, he said, "There might be some changes in the Myriad Realms recently!"

"Did your son die?"

"..."

Not a single good word!

The Culture King was speechless, quickly saying, "Shut up!"

He said heavily, "It's hard to say if it's good or bad, but for so many years, no one has come looking for us... which means the situation isn't great. It's all thanks to you, you fool!"

"Tch, if I hadn't come to save you, you'd have died long ago!"

The Culture King was at a loss for words and didn't say anything more. He quickly said, "Let's not talk about this. The situation in the Myriad Realms is unclear now. Last time that kid came, it didn't seem too good either! We shouldn't expect anyone to come to our rescue... it's good if the Myriad Realms don't need our help! I'm worried that Wenyu won't be able to hold on much longer..."

Hearing this, the Martial King became serious.

"Then... should we go save her now?"

"Yes! We must hurry! That girl has held on for this long, it's not easy. My injuries have almost healed..."

"Keep bragging!"

The Martial King mocked, quickly saying, "Do you think there's a way to have that kid open the Heaven Gate again? Not to mention anything else, do you think there's hope to move your world in?"

"No chance, unless we find the true Heaven Gate, but that's very difficult... no worries, we can still project power through the Heaven Gate's shadow!"

The Culture King smiled, "The strength will be slightly reduced, but there's no way to contact that kid now."

"You can't do it either? Not even through the Heaven Gate's shadow?"

"No, it's very difficult, unless his Heaven Gate is also strong enough, but obviously, it's not possible. Last time I saw him, he probably hadn't even reached the level of a ruler of laws..."

After talking for a while, the Culture King quickly said, "Let's not talk about this. That kid went to my pen dao again, not sure what he's doing. Did he fail to open the heavens and went to inherit the pen dao?"

He shook his head and sighed!

Probably!

What a pity!

Failed to open the heavens, so he had to inherit the pen dao. Looks like that kid has no hope of becoming the strongest.

The Martial King wasn't surprised, just shook his head, "That kid was so arrogant last time, I thought he was 100% successful in opening the heavens, but he still failed. If I meet him next time, I'll mock him to death!"

Arrogant for nothing!

Still ended up failing!

The Culture King didn't say anything more. The pen dao's shadow was shattered, and he couldn't sense what would happen next.

...

Su Yu didn't care about any of this.

After shattering the Culture King's shadow and extracting his own residual mark, he quickly stabilized the river with his Heaven Gate. A large seal shadow appeared, then fell into the river with a rumble, continuing to suppress the pen dao!

Within the pen dao, the two divine character combat skills were almost completely shattered!

Vaguely, two human figures appeared, also somewhat broken.

Su Yu frowned slightly. There was still no sign of any spiritual transformation, meaning these two hadn't grasped the pen dao at all. At this rate, they were 90% likely to fail!

Once the human figures were completely shattered, even if they transformed spiritually, it would mean all memories were lost!

At that point, they'd be just like Doubao and Flatbread!

The pen dao continued to tremble violently!

Su Yu remained silent for a while. This won't work. I have no choice but to use my trump card!

The next moment, Su Yu tore through the River of Time and vanished instantly, his voice echoing back, "Hold on, I'll be there soon!"

As soon as he disappeared, the smiles on everyone's faces faded away. Lord Xiahou spoke gravely, "This is troublesome!"

The first step didn't seem to go smoothly. Su Yu wasn't yet strong enough to suppress the pen dao or the River of Time. If this continued, Nan Wujian and Yun Chen would be completely doomed.

However, it wasn't long before Su Yu returned! This time, he came carrying a massive mountain.

With a thunderous crash, the mountain plunged into the River of Time, transforming into a dam that halted its flow. Seeing this, Su Yu's eyes lit up, and he swiftly dove into the pen dao!

Boom!

A surge of energy erupted, suppressing the pen dao. The Heaven Gate reappeared, further stabilizing it.

Seeing the pen dao more stable, Su Yu shouted, "Quick, seize the opportunity to suppress the pen dao!"

Two shadowy figures trembled, and the pen dao... was actually immobilized!

Was Su Yu really that formidable?

Well, there was no time to ponder. They had to suppress the pen dao first!

...

At the same time.

In Su Yu's world.

The Great Zhou King suddenly opened his eyes, quickly scanning his surroundings. The next moment, his mouth gaped open in shock, and he let out a piercing scream.

People quickly gathered nearby, and Wan Tiansheng asked sternly, "What's going on?"

The Great Zhou King opened his mouth, then suddenly forced a laugh and shouted, "My throat's itchy, just shouting a bit! Ahhh!"

He screamed shrilly!

Where's the Human Mountain?

Ahhh!

Where did the Human Mountain go?

Where did Su Yu take the Human Mountain?

"Crazy!"

Wan Tiansheng was speechless. Had Su Yu's actions driven him mad?

It shouldn't be. Why was he suddenly acting insane?

But the Great Zhou King didn't care about any of that, continuing his ahhh-ing, looking around, and shouting, "Where is His Majesty? I need to see him!"

"I don't know, maybe he went to the River of Time, probably to extract some power."

"River of Time?"

The Great Zhou King's expression changed slightly. Damn it, did he take the Human Mountain to suppress the river?

Could he be more humane?

Also, did this guy... figure it out?

His expression shifted, and he screamed again, "Ah, today's sky is so beautiful!"

"What's wrong with you?"

Wan Tiansheng was also helpless. Was he crazy?

Wan Tiansheng glanced at him suspiciously, looking around. What was wrong with the Great Zhou King?

There was no reason for him to suddenly go mad!

And the Great Zhou King, after screaming for a while, suddenly laughed and said, "Wan Tiansheng, His Majesty isn't here? Hahaha, you're doomed!"

Boom!

A silent character was thrown out, and he punched out. No, he needed to vent on someone, and Wan Tiansheng was perfect. He was the ruler of laws, while Wan Tiansheng was not.

I'll beat you to death, you bastard!

I'll beat you to death, you treacherous minister!

Boom, boom, boom, a series of loud noises drew countless people to watch, all seeing Wan Tiansheng being beaten miserably. Each one looked on with a strange expression. What madness had taken over the Great Zhou King?

Suddenly attacking Wan Tiansheng, wasn't he afraid of Su Yu coming back to trouble him?

Odd!

The Great Zhou King didn't care. He had to beat him for a while, or he might die of anger!

...

Meanwhile, Su Yu had no time to worry about that side. Even though he sensed the fluctuations in his world, he couldn't be bothered. It was most likely the Great Zhou King discovering the Human Mountain was missing!

Scare you to death, old man!

To be honest, the Human Mountain was truly formidable. It felt much more powerful than the Xingyu Imprint, suppressing the river like an immovable mountain. Impressive!

The pen dao was also individually suppressed by Su Yu.

After a while, the pen dao trembled violently, and then, with a rumble, it calmed down. From within the pen dao, two ghostly figures emerged.

Nan Wujian said in confusion, "It seems... transforming into spirits isn't that difficult?"

Su Yu chuckled!

Not difficult?

As a creator of worlds, a second-tier ruler of laws, he couldn't handle it alone. Do you know how much was sacrificed for your transformation?

Forget it, no point in saying more!

We need to hurry, or the Great Zhou King will go mad!

Su Yu quickly said, "You've just merged with the dao and transformed into spirits. Get familiar with it. I'll take others to continue! Also... as members of the God Devourer Race, I think the form of a furball suits you. Don't transform into humans, it's frightening, like ghosts!"

Everyone was speechless. Ghosts could scare you?

Transforming into furballs... how embarrassing.

...

Su Yu didn't care about that. He tirelessly led those willing to transform into spirits.

Choose any dao you like!

Whichever you want, go for it!

Even if it's already taken, it doesn't matter. If it's hard to transform, it means the other party doesn't have a deep grasp of the dao. If you encounter them, you might even trick them.

Besides transforming into spirits, there were those merging with the dao, extracting the power of the dao...

In any case, Su Yu didn't care about anything, whether forcefully helping them merge or extracting most of the power of the dao before shoving them in. At this moment, no one cared about the consequences!

A group of madmen, coercing Su Yu, a normal person, to help them grow stronger. Su Yu was also helpless, and the Human Mountain was now being used by Su Yu as the Xingyu Imprint, with even better results!

...

After dealing with the spirit transformations and dao merges, Su Yu forcefully helped people open their yang apertures.

Once the yang apertures were opened, he tirelessly headed to the Death Realm to help Liu Hong relocate his dao. Naturally, he took the Human Mountain with him to suppress the Death Path; otherwise, it would be difficult!

I must say, the Human Mountain's effect was outstanding!

It could suppress the river, let alone the Death Path.

...

In the Death Realm, Su Yu was panting heavily, finally relocating Liu Hong's Ink Dao to the intersection.

As soon as he finished, Liu Hong shamelessly said, "Your Majesty, since it's already relocated, why not help expand my dao a bit?"

"......"

Screw you!

Go to hell!

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him. Soon, he rushed to the River of Time to extract some power from the physical dao to help those who had opened their yang apertures grow stronger.

Currently, this power was insignificant. Even Nan Wujian and Yun Chen, who had merged with the pen dao, had only just begun to integrate and couldn't fully utilize the pen dao's power.

But given some time, it wouldn't be long before those who transformed into spirits and opened their yang apertures would become powerful!

...

This time, Su Yu spent quite a bit of time.

Three days later, Su Yu returned to his world, exhausted, carrying the Human Mountain. During these three days, the Great Zhou King, this lunatic, went around challenging people to duels, probably fighting more in these three days than in his entire life!

When Su Yu returned, he saw the Great Zhou King being pinned to the ground and beaten by seven or eight rulers of laws!

All around, a group of people, bruised and swollen, hadn't recovered yet, cheering and encouraging!

"Beat him to death!"

"Beat this bastard to death!"

"Goodness, His Majesty just disappeared for three days, and he's already rebelling. Beat him to death!"

"......"

A group of bruised and swollen people, filled with hatred!

Infuriating!

This Great Zhou King, causing trouble for no reason, and now he's being beaten, right?

Until Su Yu tossed the Human Mountain aside with a rumble, shaking the world, did everyone finally stop. The Great Zhou King, beaten black and blue, his eyes swollen shut, finally relaxed when he saw the Human Mountain land. He looked at Su Yu approaching from a distance, wanting to say something.

Before he could speak, someone complained, "Your Majesty, as soon as you left, the Great Zhou King rebelled and almost killed Principal Wan!"

Su Yu squinted, smiling as he looked at the Great Zhou King, "Great Zhou King, I just left, and what are you up to? Forget it, I won't hold it against you. I'm not unreasonable. Just speak well of me to the Human Emperor when you see him!"

"......"

The Great Zhou King bared his teeth. What kind of good words do you want?

I wish I could hammer you to death right now!

Su Yu's smile was radiant, ignoring him. Scared you, didn't I, old man? This time you were probably really frightened, serves you right!

Without saying much, Su Yu quickly said, "Alright, disperse! Go train hard, each of you. Too idle, aren't you? If you're really too idle, I'll call the Martial Emperor back to spar with you!"

In an instant, the place emptied, everyone fleeing.

Forget it!

Who wants to fight the Martial Emperor? That's a death wish!

And Su Yu, smiling, glanced at the Great Zhou King, then quickly disappeared. The Great Zhou King waited for a while, inadvertently glancing at the Human Mountain. When he saw the pitted surface of the Human Mountain, his face turned pale.

Damn!

What did he do?

This... this was corroded by the water of time!

That bastard Su Yu took the Human Mountain to soak in the River of Time?

And not just for a short while!

Faintly, on the Human Mountain, a hint of golden light could be seen. The Great Zhou King's face turned white, quickly flying towards the Human Mountain, disappearing into it. The golden light on the Human Mountain also quickly vanished.

...

In the distance.

Su Yu's figure appeared, chuckling.

Exciting, isn't it?

Should be exciting enough!

But this time, it wasn't intentional. Without the Human Mountain, he couldn't solve the problem. It was just a coincidence!

"Extract a bit more power from the dao, strengthen the world, and then I should find a way to understand the situation at the front line!"

Thinking back to that day, I thought bringing over a dozen rulers of laws to rescue people would surprise the Human Emperor. Now... forget it, whether the Human Emperor is surprised or not doesn't matter. What's important is to be cautious of the Myriad Races being shocked, scared enough to fight to the death!

"In the eyes of the Myriad Races' experts, this time, the Myriad Races have produced some rulers of laws, and they haven't died. This can serve as an entry point!"

Su Yu quickly calculated in his mind. Pretend?

Not easy to pretend!

The Human Emperor and the others are blocking the front!
