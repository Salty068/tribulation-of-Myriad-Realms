Chapter 768: Scholars Are Troublesome (Ten Thousand Words for Subscription)

A great war erupted in the Upper Realm.

Chaos ensued!

Of course, Su Yu was unaware of the turmoil in the Upper Realm, nor could he know. He only knew that he needed to accelerate the opening of his path.

It was troublesome!

The ancient beasts seemed to be increasing in number.

Ahead, Lantian, the Tea Plant, and Fat Ball, three powerful beings, were swiftly dealing with those ancient beasts. They killed the beasts and tossed the corpses to the Great Ming King to craft talismans, preventing rejection by the Great Dao in the chaotic region.

Without talismans, one could still enter the chaotic land, but it would easily attract more ancient beasts.

"Stabilize yin and yang, separate heaven and earth!"

Su Yu roared, "Everyone, watch carefully. Those not participating in the battle, observe the Dao!"

He shouted, "Do not be disturbed! Once your strength grows, all disturbances will cease to be disturbances, understand?"

He needed everyone to become stronger!

Not to think about immediately resisting the ancient beasts, which was unnecessary for now.

Everyone's hearts tightened, and they began to observe the Dao.

The opportunity was rare!

"Open the heavens and establish my world!"

Rumble!

Chaos was being opened, a newborn world was being born, with the Five Elements boiling, yin and yang separated, and heaven and earth initially divided.

"Life and death, yin and yang, the Three Talents, Four Symbols, Five Elements, Eight Trigrams..."

The Great Dao was being frantically opened, one after another, but the path of life and death, Su Yu still hadn't outlined.

Life and death were the hardest!

One by one, the Great Daos were woven and fused together, for the Great Dao also had its rules.

Rumble!

Thunder roared!

The void exploded, trying to destroy this new world.

"Starry Sky Seal the heavens and earth!"

A grand seal suppressed the new world.

A fierce glint flashed in Su Yu's eyes. If it really came to it, he would break the Starry Sky Seal to stabilize this world. At this moment, the new world was being battered by chaos, teetering on the brink of collapse.

"Stabilize, solidify, fix, suppress..."

Su Yu shouted, as divine characters appeared one by one, merging into the Mark of Civilization. Pages flew out, opening the Great Dao, each with the effect of stabilizing and suppressing the heavens and earth.

At this moment, the experts in the Land of the Abyss were dazzled.

So many Great Daos!

Su Yu actually mastered so many Great Daos?

A terrifying fellow!

How old was he?

How did he do it?

Of course, Su Yu had no time to pay attention to them. At this moment, the Great Dao was being opened, but it hadn't fused into the Yu Dao, which was incomplete!

Those newly appeared Great Daos were still in separate lines.

Yet Su Yu was rapidly weaving these Great Daos, intertwining the power of these newly emerged Great Daos.

While weaving, he transmitted the sound of the Great Dao: "The Yu Dao is incomplete, still lacking life and death, but for now, I won't outline life and death. I'll open the path in segments, weaving it into three segments: Yu Dao as the beginning, myriad paths of civilization as the middle, and Zhou Dao as the end!"

Everyone's hearts tightened.

Su Yu wasn't perfecting the Yu Dao at this moment, probably not for the sake of segmentation, but because he wasn't confident!

With Su Yu's character, if he were confident, he would have opened the path of life and death first!

Boom!

Another loud noise came, but this time, it wasn't from Su Yu's side, but from where Lantian and the others were.

At this moment, an enormous beast traversed the void.

The beast's aura was formidable. With a glance at Su Yu's side, its giant eyes revealed a hint of solemnity and surprise. The next moment, it actually spoke in the common language, its voice echoing the previous loud rumble.

"Unexpected... truly unexpected! In this era, someone is opening the heavens again!"

The beast was shaped like a fierce tiger.

But it had wings, similar to a flying tiger, yet it had four pairs of wings.

Some races of the Myriad Realms might have originally been chaotic beasts, later integrating into the Myriad Realms and transforming.

For example, the Iron Devourer Race, the Space Ancient Beast Race, and the Hou Race might have originally been chaotic beasts.

If the Desolate Beast hadn't died back then, having integrated into the Myriad Realms, it might have created the Desolate Beast Race.

This beast might be the prototype of the flying tiger.

The beast spoke the common language, evidently having interacted with beings from the Myriad Realms. At this moment, with a hint of shock and surprise, it looked at Su Yu again, "Without mastering the Great Dao of the Myriad Realms, you directly open the heavens... you are the weakest I've seen opening the heavens..."

From its words, it seemed it had seen more than one!

"Opening the heavens and seeking the Dao is your ability. I know there's a saying in the Myriad Realms: cutting off one's path is a deep-seated enmity, unending until death!"

The giant tiger spoke, lamenting, "However, you are opening the heavens in chaos, encroaching on the territory of our chaotic ancient race! The more heavens are opened, the smaller our living space becomes. If we don't stop you, you open the heavens, he opens the heavens, this chaos... will no longer be chaos!"

"We do not wish to integrate into this so-called Myriad Realms, to be shackled, free in chaos, why be constrained?"

"The so-called path of opening the heavens is a shackle... one layer is not enough, there is another layer!"

Its tone carried some sighs, "This is a struggle for the Dao! A struggle for the Great Dao! We cannot let you succeed in opening the heavens. Those who can open the heavens in the Myriad Realms are unparalleled in talent, we admire that, yet even so, we cannot let you succeed!"

It didn't immediately engage in battle, rather, it was somewhat refined.

First, it explained the grievances. This was a struggle for the Dao, Su Yu was encroaching on the territory of the chaotic beasts, which was unacceptable.

It admired Su Yu's talent, but it still had to stop him!

In the distance, Su Yu continued to open the path, and upon hearing this, he laughed loudly, "You are not wrong, nor do I think I am wrong! In an era of great contention, I open my path, chaos belongs neither to you nor to me, born of chaos... you dare not seek the Lord of Time, dare not seek the Lord of Death, I am weak, that is the original sin! Likewise, you are weak, you are also the original sin, the fault lies not with you or me, in this era, the strong are revered!"

"Indeed!"

The fierce tiger didn't find any issue with that, indeed, the chaotic ancient race cared more about the distinction between strength and weakness.

"So, this time, we must fight!"

"Roar!"

A thunderous roar echoed in all directions, the fierce tiger's wings flapped, breaking through the void, charging towards Su Yu.

Simultaneously, the White Dog suddenly expanded a million times, transforming into a being as large as the tiger, baring its teeth, "Back off!"

At this moment, the White Dog was fierce and menacing.

The eight-winged tiger was somewhat shaken, "So it's the Sun Devouring Divine Dog! Didn't you follow a powerful human and leave chaos back then? That powerful one... has long disappeared, right?"

"Huh?"

The White Dog was confused, what nonsense.

"You've regressed..."

At this moment, the tiger sighed, "The Sun Devouring Divine Dog of yesteryear, now... even weaker than me. In the past, you devoured the chaotic sun, unparalleled in strength, who would have thought... you've become so weak, or are you merely a descendant of the Sun Devouring Divine Dog?"

Indeed, this tiger, though not a ruler of laws, its aura was not weaker than some Heavenly Sovereigns, perhaps even stronger.

Not weaker than that Yue Hao from back then.

After the conversation, its wings flapped instantly, shattering the void as it came.

"The strong of chaos have long been sealed, we are merely remnants of the chaotic race, the era belonging to chaos has become the past... however, we remaining chaotic ancient races will not let you continue to devour chaos!"

"This is our home, Sun Devouring Divine Dog... if it were back then, I wouldn't dare contend with you, but now, you assist this human opening the heavens, then I shall kill you!"

In a few short words, it contained countless secrets.

The strong of chaos have long been sealed!

While opening the path, Su Yu listened, this creature knew quite a bit. He quickly asked, "Sealed behind the Gate of Hell? Does chaos wish to return?"

"Of course!"

The tiger's voice shook the heavens and earth, "Does this world belong to you? No, it belongs to us! Everything must return to chaos! Human race, your race is also a chaotic race, all races are chaotic races, isn't chaos good? Opening the Myriad Realms isn't enough? Why open the heavens again!"

All things in the world originate from chaos.

Evidently, the human race is no exception.

The Myriad Realms have been opened, the Upper Realm, the Death Realm have been opened, now they want to open another day, the chaotic ancient race naturally wouldn't agree.

In the void, the White Dog quickly engaged in battle with the opponent.

That tiger was indeed powerful.

In the blink of an eye, its wings flapped, claws tearing through the void, the White Dog almost couldn't block it, with a puff, its flesh was torn by the opponent.

"Sun Devouring Divine Dog... you've truly regressed! Indeed, going to the Myriad Realms wasn't a good thing, losing your wildness, losing your true self! You've even regressed in your ability to devour the sun, now you only know how to bite... pathetic!"

The tiger was indeed incredibly powerful, speaking didn't hinder it from continuously injuring the White Dog. The White Dog's biting path was adept at attacking the Great Dao, but the opponent's path was the chaotic Great Dao, which was essentially a collection of myriad paths, primarily strong in physical instincts.

Here, the White Dog encountered its greatest setback.

Its path wasn't targeted enough.

It couldn't bite through the opponent's path because the opponent's path was in chaos, chaos was the path!

"Woof woof... awooo..."

The White Dog howled at the sky, feeling somewhat aggrieved, manipulating the boot, quickly kicking at the tiger.

The tiger was shocked, "The boot of that powerful human from back then? It's a treasure, but... only one, you actually have to rely on external objects to deal with me, how pathetic, how lamentable, Sun Devouring Divine Dog, your reputation is utterly lost..."

This tiger, perhaps having no one to talk to usually, was quite talkative at this moment.

And Su Yu, feeling somewhat strange, suddenly asked, "Your common language is quite good, who taught you?"

"Good, is it?"

The tiger let out a wild laugh, "I knew it, I speak well! Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated. We of the chaotic race will eventually wage war with the Myriad Realms, returning to chaos. I have ambitions, to master the languages of the myriad races. I not only speak the common language, but I also speak the human language!"

With that, it quickly spoke in the human language, "Hey, you there, give up opening the heavens early, the path of opening the heavens is a great rebellion, deserving of execution!"

"......"

To hell with you!

This tiger really knew how to show off its literary skills.

Su Yu was speechless. At this moment, seeing the White Dog feeling aggrieved, even using the boot but still being suppressed by the opponent, Su Yu was also frustrated.

The White Dog wasn't targeted enough against the chaotic Great Dao.

Sun Devouring Divine Dog?

Indeed, the White Dog's path, strictly speaking, was also a devouring Great Dao?

Chapter 1: The Devouring Path

In the vast expanse of the Myriad Realms, whispers of the past lingered like echoes in the wind. It was said that the Culture King once sought the Iron Devourer Race to modify the Devouring Path for his White Dog. Thus, the path of the White Dog was transformed.

At this moment, Su Yu stood before the Devouring Path he had just opened. He too had forged a path of devouring.

"The Sun Devouring Divine Canine..."

The current path of the White Dog was more suited for biting. The Time Sage had humorously recorded it as the Biting Path, but in essence, it was about devouring the power of the opponent's path. This path was not weak, in fact, it was quite formidable. In the Myriad Realms, the White Dog had no trouble dealing with those of the same level. When the power of the paths was equal, the White Dog's Biting Path could overpower any path.

However, in the chaos, it faced some limitations.

"The Biting Path isn't weak, but it can't trace back to the source. It bites into the opponent's path power, but the opponent's path power is within the chaos..."

At this moment, Su Yu observed his own Devouring Path, which was consuming the chaotic power. The chaotic power that attacked was being devoured by the Devouring Path.

Su Yu's eyes flickered, and he shouted, "Fat Ball, the Biting Path doesn't have to target only the path. It doesn't have to focus on just one type of power! There are countless paths, and the Biting Path can bite into the power of all paths! Chaos is also a path, devour the chaotic power from all directions, bite off the source of the chaotic power..."

"Woof!"

The White Dog, feeling aggrieved and furious, had been battered by the giant tiger. It hadn't felt this frustrated even when fighting Yue Hao. Now, it was covered in wounds.

In just a short while!

With a bite, the surrounding chaos seemed to vanish, and all the chaotic power was swallowed into the White Dog's belly.

"Woof!"

With another bite, the chaotic power around dissipated instantly. The tiger, which had been charging at high speed, suddenly slowed down, finding itself in a vacuum of chaotic power.

Su Yu coldly remarked, "If the path of chaos were truly that strong, it wouldn't have its territory invaded by myriad paths! The path of chaos has too many flaws! The myriad paths are muddled and mixed, not necessarily better because they're more primitive!"

Some things are not better just because they're more primitive.

Would the master of the Time Path know chaotic power?

Absolutely!

Why did he open the heavens?

The organized paths are much stronger than the chaotic paths, but most people can't grasp too much path power.

The flaws of the chaotic path were now fully exposed.

Without a complete system, chaotic power is just chaotic path. When chaotic power dissipates, these creatures, aside from their strong bodies, aren't strong in any other way!

The White Dog devoured the chaotic power in the surrounding void, and the giant tiger's speed instantly dropped!

Its explosive power weakened!

Fat Ball was delighted, "Big Tiger, I'm going to bite you to death!"

"Woof!"

Excited, it opened its giant mouth and devoured the surrounding chaotic power. Then, it quickly broke through the void, biting towards the giant tiger and catching its wing in one bite!

With a crunch, sparks flew.

The giant tiger roared, quickly retreating into the chaos, but the White Dog was addicted, continuing to devour, swallowing a large amount of chaotic power.

The tiger continued to retreat.

The White Dog continued to chase!

As it chased and devoured, Su Yu suddenly shouted, "Come back!"

The White Dog paused, but quickly retreated back to the vacuum, puzzled. What's wrong?

I was making it retreat step by step!

As soon as it retreated, the tiger suddenly poked its head out from the chaos it had just entered, looking at Su Yu with some frustration, "Why did you make it leave?"

Su Yu ignored it and shouted, "Fat Ball, digest the chaotic power, you've swallowed too much!"

Fat Ball was stunned. Too much?

It didn't feel much!

But upon careful sensing, Fat Ball was startled. Its tail stopped wagging, and it felt a bit scared, "Why is my stomach full? I can eat a lot, but why didn't I feel full just now?"

It realized it had overeaten!

This time, before Su Yu could explain, the giant tiger grumbled, "Foolish creature! Chaotic power, myriad path power, even if you eat a lot, you won't feel full because chaotic power is special. No matter how much you eat, you'll feel like you can eat more... It's a pity you didn't explode from overeating!"

Fat Ball was puzzled, "Why? You didn't get to the point, why won't I feel full?"

At this moment, all around, whether it was the ancient beasts or Wan Tiansheng and the others, they were all speechless.

Were these two fighting or chatting?

The tiger paused, stammering, "You just won't feel full. Many chaotic ancient races exploded from overeating chaotic power without realizing it!"

As for the reason, how would I know?

I'm just an eight-winged tiger that can talk!

Really, I haven't studied this.

At this moment, Su Yu continued to open the path, speaking as he did, "Because everything originates from chaos! Strictly speaking, we all come from chaos, and are one with chaos! Just like a drop of water, when it falls into the ocean, it quickly merges and is not easily distinguished!"

"This is the difference between myriad paths and chaos. Chaotic power is water, while myriad paths are oil and vinegar. They all look like water, but you can tell them apart at a glance. You can taste the difference, whether it's too salty or too sweet..."

"When you devour the power of myriad paths, you'll notice if it's too much. But when you devour chaotic power, no matter how much you swallow, you'll feel like you haven't eaten much..."

"Truly smart!"

This was said by the tiger, with admiration, "The Human Race is indeed impressive! Hey, you Human Race, the oil and vinegar you mentioned, can you give me some? This Sun Devouring Divine Canine devours chaotic power, I may not be able to kill you, but you also can't easily kill me. If you give me some oil, water, and vinegar, I might not bother you again..."

"......"

All around, everyone was stunned.

What the heck?

What's with this tiger?

Su Yu laughed. This tiger... interesting, it must have read books, yes, definitely!

But perhaps it only read books and never visited the Myriad Realms.

"Have you read books?"

"Of course!"

The eight-winged tiger laughed, "I am a scholarly tiger!"

"......"

To hell with you!

Among the chaotic beasts, there was such an oddball, unbelievable.

Oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, Su Yu really didn't have any right now.

Su Yu shouted, "Who brought oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, give it some!"

In the distance, among the crowd, everyone looked at each other, and the next moment, everyone was at a loss. Who would bring such things?

It was the battling Lantian who suddenly threw out a storage ring and shouted, "There's some inside!"

Everyone looked at Lantian strangely. Why would you bring this?

And Lantian was unfazed.

Why?

Because I transform into myriad paths, myriad races, there's always a time to cook, is it strange to bring these?

I've even been a virtuous woman!

What are you looking at?

Look again, and I won't be polite!

"What are you looking at, it's for King Tiger!"

"......"

Silence fell over the surroundings.

Among the crowd, the low-profile Extermination King paused, then his face turned red!

Damn you!

A battle is a battle, but at this moment, this tiger was the strongest. If it didn't fight, no one minded chatting with it.

And the tiger didn't care about these things.

Its huge paw took the small storage ring, praising, "This is a storage ring, right? Compressing space, usable by any creature... Unfortunately, it's useless to me. We of the Chaos Race prefer to store everything in our bellies. This space is too weak, too small!"

With a flap of its wings, the storage ring shattered, revealing a small space.

Inside were bottles and jars, a pile of them. It took out a jar and swallowed it whole, not caring what it was. As long as it wasn't poisonous, it didn't sense any harmful danger.

It swallowed it in one gulp, its huge mouth licking slightly. It wasn't even enough to fill the gaps between its teeth, but it still tasted something, surprised, "What is this taste... according to your Human Race, what should it be called?"

Su Yu continued to open the path, speaking as he laughed, "That's sugar, sweet!"

"Sugar?"

The giant tiger nodded, "Indeed, it's different from the taste of water, but water... chaotic water also has a taste."

Su Yu condensed a ball of water and threw it at it.

"This is water used by the Human Race, it's different..."

The giant tiger swallowed it, exclaiming, "It is different, bland and tasteless! You say chaotic path is water, myriad paths are oil, which one is oil? Which jar?"

"The yellow one..."

The giant tiger quickly found several jars, not caring, it started eating directly. After eating for a while, it sighed, "It is different, Human Race, you are very smart, scholars are indeed different! Indeed, chaotic path is water, myriad paths are oil... completely different! Drinking water may not have a feeling, drinking oil definitely has a feeling..."

Su Yu couldn't be bothered to respond.

If this tiger didn't fight, they could talk.

If it fought, the Great Ming King was quickly crafting formation symbols, and Su Yu saw that Wan Tiansheng and the others had received the symbols and were preparing to move.

With so many experts, they could still manage to besiege this giant tiger.

And the giant tiger, after tasting for a while, suddenly showed a cunning smile in its giant eyes, "Human Race, you want to kill me, it's impossible! Chaos is my home, I come and go as I please, I am a scholarly tiger, I know your Human Race is full of tricks!"

"I once read a military book written by a great power, 'Ninety-Nine Escape Strategies', introducing countless escape strategies!"

It looked at the ancient beasts still fighting and gathering, showing a cunning smile, "They are foolish, but I am not... Human Race, your race has a saying, this place is opened by me, if you want to open this path, leave a toll! You open the heavens, there are too many people, I can't compete! But soon, stronger ones from the Chaos Race will come... you hand over the toll, and I will retreat... you will have one less strong enemy!"

"Otherwise, this Sun Devouring Divine Canine may not be my match!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned again. Damn, was this extortion?

This... when did the Chaos Ancient Beasts turn into this kind of creature? Even in the Upper Realm, the Chaos Ancient Beasts they had encountered weren't like this. Despite their intelligence, they would fight to the death in such battles. Yet here, they were suddenly asking for something else!

Su Yu chuckled, "What do you want?"

"As the saying goes, 'Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.' I want books, ten thousand... no, a hundred thousand volumes!"

Su Yu was taken aback!

Everyone else was equally stunned.

The giant tiger's voice boomed like a bell, "Books! I want books, any kind will do, but they must not be the same! Don't think I'm without wisdom. I can read, I can write. I want a hundred thousand books!"

It actually wanted books!

This time, Su Yu was genuinely dumbfounded, almost losing his focus on his path!

The tiger grew impatient, "Give me the books, and I'll leave! I've already sensed a large number of Chaos Ancient Beasts approaching, perhaps even some as strong as me. Human, you better think this through! Once they arrive, they'll be far more intelligent than the Chaos Ancient Beasts you're fighting now... at that point, I won't be able to retreat!"

Should they buy their way out with books or not?

Naturally, Su Yu's group weighed their options. Buy them!

Books, who didn't carry some books with them?

In an instant, Wan Tiansheng quickly said, "We can, but we might not have 100,000 volumes. We don't carry that many books with us!"

The giant tiger's eyes glinted with cunning, "How many can you give?"

"Ten thousand volumes!"

"Deal, quickly, I need to leave, or else the other ancient tribes will arrive!"

Wan Tiansheng swiftly gathered various books and, after a short while, tossed a storage ring over. The giant tiger swallowed it in one gulp, sensed it, and counted, "A few short, but never mind, I'm not a tiger who quibbles over details... I'm off!"

With that, it vanished into the void, moving at an astonishing speed, its eight wings flapping rapidly. As it left, it called back, "Hey, you Openers of Heaven, since we made a deal, I'll give you a piece of advice: don't randomly kill my Chaos Ancient Tribe's experts! Kill too many, and you'll meet a bad end! My Chaos Ancient Tribe is about to return to this world, the Gate of Hell will open, and if you kill my tribe, beware of retaliation!"

With those words, the giant tiger completely disappeared.

Meanwhile, Lantian and the others swiftly slaughtered the remaining ancient beasts, cutting them down in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, everyone exchanged bewildered glances.

What on earth?

They had truly encountered a bizarre tiger!

No, perhaps it was truly wise.

Because it hadn't asked for any resources or anything else; it asked for books!

Books, the carriers of civilization.

For a Chaos Beast that doesn't travel the Myriad Realms, books are actually the best way to understand the civilization of the Myriad Realms. To the Chaos Tribe, these might indeed be more important than resources!

Ten thousand volumes!

Everyone carried some important books with them, perhaps various techniques, including records of civilizations and races.

With these books, this tiger might quickly understand the situation of the Myriad Realms, even peering into the civilization of the myriad paths.

As Su Yu continued to forge his path, he suddenly sighed, "This Myriad Realms, this chaos... indeed, even ancient beasts know that books are the foundation of all paths!"

What an eye-opener!

Su Yu suddenly laughed, "This eight-winged tiger, having lived until now and even witnessed others opening the heavens, indeed, it didn't rely on luck!"

Wisdom!

This tiger had long since gained intelligence!

However, its strength didn't seem to reach the expected level; it wasn't a master of rules. Su Yu was also puzzled, why was that?

Could it be a lack of aptitude?

And it said that the strong ones among the Chaos Ancient Beasts were all sealed, all behind the Gate of Hell. Indeed, the Gate of Hell sealed an era, an era belonging to chaos. Could it be crafted by the Master of Time?

The Master of Time ended the era of chaos, sealing that era!

There was no time to think further, as everyone soon sensed the presence of many ancient beasts!

Wan Tiansheng and the others flew out from the Land of the Abyss.

At this moment, these people carried formation symbols and were no longer repelled.

Just then, a loud eagle's cry echoed!

In the next moment, an enormous bird appeared!

Su Yu was slightly startled, and Fat Ball was also surprised, "Su Yu, this seems to be the bird March fought last time!"

Yes, they seemed to have seen it at Chaos Mountain last time!

When they fled, March seemed to have fought this bird!

Su Yu was also shocked, coming from Chaos Mountain!

The Upper Realm and Lower Realm, no, and the Death Realm, the chaotic regions were actually connected.

Indeed!

Deep within the Land of the Abyss, in the depths of the endless void, deep within Chaos Mountain, these three places might be interconnected. Of course, walking in the depths of chaos, one could encounter danger at any time!

Under normal circumstances, even a master of rules wouldn't dare to recklessly traverse chaos to walk the three realms!

Su Yu's heart stirred, and in the next moment, he shouted, "Kill them all, leave none alive, kill them quickly!"

This group of ancient beasts couldn't be left alive.

Otherwise, if they had any collusion with the Control King's lineage, the news might leak out.

Moreover, killing this group of ancient beasts had its benefits!

With Chaos Mountain devoid of barrier beasts, the myriad races might start a war.

That was a good thing!

Su Yu shouted, "Everyone, attack! Don't worry about the repulsion! Fat Ball, Jiuyue, Flatbread, Hou Pseudo Emperor, you are responsible for devouring the chaotic power, clear the chaos around everyone, kill them!"

"Ow!"

Fat Ball roared, quickly devouring, and Flatbread and the others also quickly attacked, all starting to devour.

Su Yu reminded again, "Be careful not to overeat, especially Flatbread! Doubao, watch over Flatbread... no, forget it, Furball, watch over your mom, don't let her eat too much!"

Flatbread was bewildered, why mention me?

And Furball quickly landed on its mother's head, feeling a bit sad, its mom didn't seem very smart!

Even Xiangxiang was specially reminded.

And Su Yu's reminder was clearly correct. Soon, the unrestrained Flatbread, having devoured too much chaotic power, was on the verge of exploding, yet it hadn't realized and was still devouring.

Furball was so frightened it hurriedly jumped to stop it, finally making Flatbread close its mouth and stop devouring!

"Kill!"

Wan Tiansheng and the others seized this opportunity, launching a frenzied attack, the entire army charging!

On the other side, there were thirty to forty ancient beasts, among them, the giant bird was at the Heavenly Sovereign level, with several at the Heavenly King level.

However, on this side, Fat Ball, Lantian, and Wan Tiansheng quickly joined forces, suppressing the giant bird, while the other Daofuse experts charged at the ancient beasts!

In an instant, the battle was earth-shattering, chaos splitting apart!

And at the rear, Su Yu continued to forge his own path.

Pages of books appeared, paths blossomed, and were quickly fused by him.

Meanwhile, the South Heavenly King and the other undead hadn't joined the battle, instead guarding the edge of the Land of the Abyss, preventing any undead experts from attacking. With their deterrence, even if the North King and others had the courage of a bear, they wouldn't dare approach.

"Boom!"

The sound was immense, echoing even in the Death Realm.

At this moment, everyone realized that Su Yu and his group had actually gone to the edge of chaos to kill Chaos Ancient Beasts!

It was unbelievable!

...

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's expression was also changing.

Am I not even as good as a Chaos Ancient Beast?

Killing Chaos Ancient Beasts but not me, is this looking down on me or what?

A bit angry, yet also a bit desolate.

Su Yu would rather take people to kill Chaos Ancient Beasts than come to kill me, what does this mean?

...

In the Sealed Land.

The Death Emperor's face appeared again, turning to look back, towards the depths, feeling a vague unease. This Su Yu, the Human Emperor, what was he doing at the rear?

Suddenly attracting so many Chaos Ancient Beasts, Chaos Ancient Beasts weren't everywhere, why come here?

A very strange thing!

In the Sealed Pillar, Dizhi Luo was somewhat gloating, "Better if they're killed, Chaos Ancient Beasts generally don't appear, yet he brought people to kill Chaos Ancient Beasts, be careful not to poke a hornet's nest!"

This Su Yu, is he bored?

Bringing so many people to kill Chaos Ancient Beasts, who knows what he's thinking.

Accompanied by a shrill cry, a thunderous boom, an enormous bird, its shadow covering the sky, so huge that the entire Death Realm vaguely saw the gigantic bird.

But at this moment, the bird's head was stomped to pieces by a boot!

Some undead were shocked!

Those familiar with it remembered this boot, the West Heavenly King was stomped to death by this boot that day!

And now, an enormous bird, immensely powerful, seemingly stronger than the West Heavenly King, was still stomped to death by this boot.

Even Dizhi Luo didn't mock anymore.

Suddenly, for a moment, there was a slight regret!

Provoking these people might not be a good thing!

That giant bird, feeling extremely strong, was actually killed!

...

At the same time.

In the chaos.

An eight-winged tiger silently retreated, silently lamenting, this Overturning Sky Eagle was a bit foolish.

It was obvious that the other side was strong, yet it charged in before the strong ones gathered, wasn't that courting death?

At least wait a bit, see if any other strong Chaos Ancient Tribe members arrive.

The Overturning Sky Eagle's strength might not be inferior to mine, yet it was still killed. Indeed, many ants can bite an elephant to death, the humans weren't lying!

"Openers of Heaven... the weakest Openers of Heaven... but even so, there are people protecting his path. Once he successfully opens the heavens, he won't be easy to provoke, why bother!"

The eight-winged tiger couldn't be bothered anymore, it seemed there was no advantage to be gained, I'm leaving!

Once I've read these books, know myself and the enemy, I'll decide what to do next.

"The civilization of the myriad races is indeed more prosperous than my Chaos Tribe... falling behind means getting beaten, blindly fighting isn't the right path anymore. I hope our old friends understand this, otherwise, even if they break out from the Gate of Hell... our era should end!"

The eight-winged tiger sighed deeply, in the era of chaos, strength reigned supreme, one-on-one was king, just one word—fight!

But in this era, it's not just about fighting to win!

"The key is, even if we fight, we might not win!"

"The Lords of Creation I've encountered, weren't they all dominant in their eras?"

"Truly terrifying..."

The Eight-Winged Tiger flew further and further away. As a scholarly tiger, it understood a simple truth: a wise man does not stand under a dangerous wall! Watching the battle was not a wise choice!

...

At this moment, Su Yu, who was in the midst of creation, slightly raised his eyebrows. In his ear, Wan Tiansheng's voice echoed, "It ran away!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, saying nothing more. He had sensed it; that creature had been spying just now. After killing the old eagle, he had actually wanted to keep the Eight-Winged Tiger. Unfortunately, this scholarly tiger was indeed intelligent. Sensing the unfavorable situation, it fled in an instant!

"I'm not afraid of strength; I'm afraid of intelligence!"

Su Yu had a feeling that he and this tiger would meet again!
