Chapter 830: Preparations (Seeking Subscriptions)

With everything arranged, Su Yu needed to enhance his strength.

He had never stopped comprehending the Great Dao. However, with myriad paths available, comprehending them was incredibly challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, Su Yu resorted to a method akin to "shearing the sheep" to quickly boost his power. If the Master of Time were present and not so powerful, Su Yu would have long stripped him bare.

In fact, Su Yu wasn't the only one doing this. Nowadays, anyone who had opened the heavens was doing the same. Everyone was trying to expand their worlds rapidly by drawing from the Master of Time. If Su Yu were in the Master of Time's shoes, the first thing he'd do upon appearing would be to eliminate the Lord of the Undead, then the Human Emperor, and only then deal with Su Yu.

Su Yu had only been at it for a while, yet the Lord of the Undead had nearly stripped the Death Path from the Time Path bare!

...

After returning to the Human Mountain, Su Yu wasted no time and headed back to the River of Time.

This time, he wasn't alone.

He had called upon the Martial Emperor!

Yes, the Martial Emperor had been dragged back by him, full of dissatisfaction and annoyance!

The Martial Emperor didn't enjoy being around Su Yu!

However, if Su Yu summoned him and he didn't come, Su Yu would directly harm his physical body.

This bastard was that ruthless!

...

In the River of Time.

The Martial Emperor glared at Su Yu, full of frustration. Why call me again?

Su Yu didn't care whether he was willing or not. As long as he could be used, Su Yu would use him to the fullest. Better to use him now than regret it later.

Su Yu was straightforward, "Help me find some unclaimed paths of rules. You can generally tell if a path is claimed or not. You've opened the Heaven Gate, and besides me, you're the only one who has! Mark every unclaimed path for me..."

The Martial Emperor took a deep breath and grumbled, "What do you want to do?"

"Extract power. Stop talking nonsense and get to work!"

"…"

The Martial Emperor was not pleased, his eyes flickering, "Fine, but without a physical body, I can't open the Heaven Gate!"

You need to return my body to me!

Su Yu turned his head to look at him, smiling, "How about... I destroy your Sea of Will and see if someone can take over your body? How about that? You could still open the Heaven Gate!"

"…"

The Martial Emperor was speechless. Lying to someone who had opened the Heaven Gate was clearly useless.

The Sea of Will could also open the Heaven Gate.

But without a physical body, it was indeed uncomfortable.

The Martial Emperor didn't want to say anything more, nor did he want to stay with Su Yu. He quickly turned and ran.

Su Yu shouted, "Don't run to the Human Emperor's side!"

"Do you need to say that?"

The Martial Emperor snorted after running far away. Nonsense, don't I know that?

If I go alone and have a bad relationship with the Human Emperor, I might be killed as an enemy. Where would I go to argue then?

The Martial Emperor ran swiftly, and Su Yu didn't bother with him.

Now, some things could indeed only be helped by the Martial Emperor. This guy was weak, but he was indeed a genius, a super genius who had opened the Heaven Gate.

360 acupoints and 360 apertures weren't something just anyone could open.

However, for someone who had opened the Heaven Gate to still be struggling to reach the second tier was quite embarrassing for the Heaven Gate.

As Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate to search for the power of the Great Dao, he pondered some questions.

Hundred Battle King and the others had opened the Human Gate, while Yu Qing and the others had opened the Gate of Hell.

It didn't seem too difficult.

Especially the Gate of Hell, which wasn't opened by just one or two people. Could it be that the earlier the gate appeared, the weaker it was?

So the difficulty of opening it was lower?

"Opening the Human Gate requires 720 physical acupoints..."

But Su Yu thought carefully. Perhaps his and Hundred Battle King's body structures were different. Su Yu was 100% sure that the human body couldn't open 720 physical acupoints.

The Giant Race might be able to. When he had time, he could study it, including the Sin Race, which had some descendants remaining and could also be studied.

"The Human Gate and the Gate of Hell... whether they open or not doesn't matter, but..."

Su Yu thought of Tongtian. Tongtian had difficulty advancing, and those who opened the gates were killed by Su Yu.

However, if he could master the method to open the Human Gate and the Gate of Hell, perhaps he could let Tongtian "shear the sheep," summoning the Human Gate and the Gate of Hell occasionally to gain some benefits.

"Also, the Gate of Hell can summon ancient beasts from behind the gate. As for the Human Gate, I haven't seen much use yet... Does the Heaven Gate only allow viewing the Great Dao?"

"Summoning the existence behind the gate should also be possible, right?"

Su Yu fell into contemplation. The Heaven Gate, as it stood, was quite effective. For Su Yu, various methods were actually assisted by the Heaven Gate.

But... it wasn't enough!

The Heaven Gate should have more undeveloped functions, like how to enter inside the Heaven Gate. Currently, Su Yu hadn't found a good method. Last time, it was only at the brink of death, at the intersection of life and death, that he broke through the Heaven Gate's shadow. But even then, he and the Culture King weren't in the same time and space.

As thoughts surfaced one by one, Su Yu soon delved into the Human Race's Physical Dao.

He directly entered with his true body!

This was actually the first time Su Yu had entered the Physical Dao so recklessly. It was vast beyond measure. From the outside, the Physical Dao seemed boundless, but upon entering, Su Yu found it even more expansive than imagined!

He focused his gaze, his heart stirred. With the Heaven Gate open, he vaguely saw that the Physical Dao was somewhat pitted, clearly having suffered significant damage over the years.

He could even vaguely see some cracks!

At this moment, within the Physical Dao, Su Yu saw waves of energy in the distance, feeling strong. It should be the Human Kings of the Physical Dao occupying territory. However, there was also a considerably vast area that remained unoccupied.

"This should be the territory previously occupied by Hundred Battle King and Zhou Ji!"

Su Yu roughly judged and quickly concluded that Hundred Battle King and Zhou Ji had occupied about one-third of the Physical Dao.

As for the Human Kings of the Physical Dao, Su Yu observed that there might still be four alive.

And these four only occupied about one-third as well.

In other words, the four Human Kings of the Physical Dao occupied territory comparable to that of Hundred Battle King and Zhou Ji. Zhou Ji and Hundred Battle King's strength was twice as strong as theirs!

Being twice as strong wasn't as simple as one versus two.

"The few Human Kings of the Physical Dao might be stronger than before. Now, they should at least be fourth tier!"

Su Yu assessed, but their progress should indeed be slow. They were all ancient Human Kings, and at this time, they might only be fourth tier, at most weak third tier, which was still quite weak for ancient Human Kings.

At this moment, with Hundred Battle King and Zhou Ji severing their paths, that area was left vacant, and no one occupied it. Mainly because the physical power of that territory had been drained, restoring it wasn't a matter of a day or two.

The entire Physical Dao had another third occupied by some weaker fluctuations.

"Some Daofuse cultivators of the Physical Dao?"

Su Yu sensed and speculated, which seemed to be the case.

Among the ancient marquises, the batch taken by the Human Emperor might still have some who cultivated the Physical Dao, occupying about a third as well. There might be some powerful Daofuse cultivators, but they hadn't reached the level of becoming a Human King of the Physical Dao.

The entire Physical Dao was thus divided into three parts, like a three-lane road.

Zhou Ji and Hundred Battle King were indeed formidable. Their cultivation time was much shorter compared to those ancient powerhouses.

"Physical Dao..."

Su Yu suddenly fell into contemplation. He came here to extract some power from the Physical Dao to perfect his own world. But upon truly seeing the Physical Dao and the vacant area... Su Yu realized that extracting power now would only mean drawing from the areas occupied by the Human Kings or those Daofuse cultivators.

That might cause some trouble on the front lines.

"Sigh!"

He had previously informed Xingyue, but at that time, he thought that even if the Human Kings of the Physical Dao weakened a bit, it wouldn't be a big problem. But now... forget it. If he extracted more, what if the myriad races saw an opportunity?

"I can't extract..."

"Then... I'll fill it in!"

Su Yu's eyes flickered. He couldn't approach this as an opener of the heavens, even if Xingyue might expose him. The myriad races didn't know.

Being an opener of the heavens... wasn't something to boast about for a weak opener.

Suddenly, a book appeared in Su Yu's hand, the Mark of Civilization!

"In that case... I'll temporarily occupy the Physical Dao and pretend to cultivate it!"

A page from the book was torn off by Su Yu and quickly fell into the vacant area!

In an instant, Su Yu's page began to occupy the territory, not using the power from the Physical Dao but rather the power of the Physical Dao from his own world. At this moment, it became distinctly separate!

Among the three lanes, the area Su Yu occupied began to show a golden hue.

This time, Su Yu didn't choose to extract power but instead chose to integrate the power of the Physical Dao from his own world. Since they were originally of the same source, there wasn't much of a problem. Although there was some minor repulsion, it quickly integrated.

In this way, he could disguise himself as a strong cultivator of the Physical Dao next time.

As for the world... the Human Emperor and others might know, but it didn't matter. At worst, he'd bluff them that his world was shattered. You can know a person's face but not their heart. Su Yu never spoke the truth to strangers or people he hadn't met.

After busying himself in the Physical Dao for a while, Su Yu actually found that the Physical Dao had suffered considerable damage over the years. This was also the reason for its current weakness. If it continued like this, without anyone to repair it, it might not be long before it had problems on its own.

On this day, after occupying the Physical Dao, Su Yu began extracting power from other Daos.

Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor, grumbling all the way, helped Su Yu search for unclaimed paths of rules.

Claimed ones could easily lead to conflicts.

...

At the same time.

Upstream of the Time Path.

Here, two massive landmasses floated as if the river of time had frozen, yet upon closer inspection, one could see that both continents were slowly drifting downstream. The pace was slow, but at this rate, it wouldn't be long before these continents reached the Myriad Realms.

At this moment, a continuous rumble echoed from the center of the two continents. On the opposite, larger continent, someone laughed heartily, "Human Emperor, why not release the seal? It seems like someone from my race has advanced! Your human race has been without reinforcements for years. It looks like your plans have failed!"

Indeed, they sensed something. Some individuals from their race seemed to have advanced. The key point was that they also felt the human race's fortune declining. For instance, those on the opposite side seemed to have a cloud hanging over their heads.

Laughter erupted from the myriad races' continent, with countless powerful beings joining in. "It seems we've won the battle for the Myriad Realms!"

No matter how much the Human Emperor schemed, he still lost. They were already at a disadvantage against the myriad races, hoping for support from the Human Realm. But now, the human race's fortune was declining, while the myriad races sensed the emergence of a new ruler of laws.

Even if a few rulers of laws couldn't change much, it was still good news. It meant the human race's plans had been thwarted!

On this day, to celebrate, the opposite side launched several small-scale assaults. Someone shouted again, "Release the seal and retreat to the Myriad Realms. You've been here for so long, isn't it troublesome? Human Emperor, why persist? If you retreat now, we won't exterminate your human race. At most, we'll just kill a few Human Kings, hahaha!"

Laughter filled the air!

...

Meanwhile, on the Human Emperor's side, the atmosphere was somewhat heavy. Had the Myriad Realms been lost? After waiting and persisting for so many years, had they failed to receive reinforcements and instead faced defeat?

It did seem like their fortune was indeed declining!

At this moment, the atmosphere was tense. However, a shadowy figure trembled slightly, and a light laugh echoed, "Don't say everything is just speculation. Even if the human race has lost in the Myriad Realms, what difference does it make if a few rulers of laws emerge?"

"Asking me to release the seal and return to the Myriad Realms is impossible!"

The Human Emperor's laughter was filled with mockery, "If you dare, then let's fight to the death! If not, keep dragging it out. By the time we return... the Gate of Hell should be opening, and a three-way battle is more fun, isn't it?"

The Human Emperor's voice was grand, his laughter hearty, "You all, unwilling to fight yet wanting to rebel, why bother?"

From the opposite side, someone coldly replied, "Human Emperor, you're at death's door, yet you remain so arrogant! You've been gravely injured for years, and your true body hasn't appeared. You probably can't be saved, can you?"

"Perhaps," the Human Emperor didn't deny it, sighing, "The injuries are too severe. Otherwise, I would have killed you all long ago!"

From the other side, someone chuckled, "The Human Emperor is still playing the empty city stratagem? Your plans aren't unknown, but... since you want to drag it out, then drag it out. Let's see when you'll die!"

It was both a probe and a threat. The Human Emperor was dying. Otherwise, his true body wouldn't have been absent for years. Of course, this was all speculation and couldn't be confirmed yet. However, the fact that the Human Emperor's true body hadn't appeared for years was undeniable. If he were fine, he would have shown up long ago instead of fighting in a state of separation between spirit and flesh.

The Human Emperor's laughter echoed again, "I'm dying soon, very soon. Everyone, hang in there a bit longer. Maybe by the time we reach the Myriad Realms, I'll just die on my own, saving you the trouble!"

With that, the Human Emperor chuckled lightly, "Alright, stop probing. Even if I say I'm dying, you wouldn't fully believe it! In that case, let's wait until we return to the Myriad Realms and see who dies first!"

Silence fell on the other side, and they no longer responded. They still held immense fear towards the Human Emperor!

Soon, both sides fell into silence.

...

In the human territory, the Human Emperor's shadow revealed a faint smile, not too clear, as he turned his back to the others and chuckled, "Alright, no need for such a heavy atmosphere. It's unnecessary! The battle for the Myriad Realms might be over... but... the victors should be the human race!"

A burly man spoke in a deep voice, "Your Majesty, did the human race win?"

"It seems so."

The Human Emperor laughed, "Didn't that Su Yu bring Xingyue over to assist in the battle? Xingyue is fine, so Su Yu is likely fine too."

Xingyue interjected, "Exactly, everything's fine! Besides, when I left, Su Yu had already killed Hundred Battle... ahem, Hundred Battle rebelled and was counter-killed by Su Yu. That guy insisted on betraying the human race. If he hadn't, he would have been quite formidable!"

One version was that Su Yu killed Hundred Battle, and another was that Hundred Battle was executed for rebelling. They sounded different.

At this moment, someone sighed, "At this point, the human race is still embroiled in internal strife... sigh!"

Helplessness!

Xingyue had returned and briefly mentioned some things, but not too much. Everyone knew that it seemed like the two generations of Human Lords had engaged in a civil war.

Xingyue dismissed it, "I said it last time, Hundred Battle wasn't a good person. He wanted to betray us long ago. Unfortunately, when I came last time, my strength hadn't recovered. Otherwise, I would have killed him! Now, he finally rebelled!"

Saying this, she ignored the rest and looked at the shadow, "Brother, how are your injuries?"

The Human Emperor laughed, "It's not too bad, but I can't appear now. If I do, the myriad races will think I'm guilty. When real seems fake, and fake seems real, it's best to intimidate them now, so they don't dare act. We'll talk about everything once we return to the Myriad Realms!"

The Human Emperor's laughter was relaxed, "You all, don't you trust me?"

"Your Majesty is wise!"

Everyone laughed, indeed, His Majesty was incredibly powerful, and now he was intimidating the myriad races. Of course, some were slightly worried, but after thinking about it, maybe... perhaps there really was nothing wrong.

Even if there were concerns, they couldn't voice them. That would be truly terrifying.

As everyone chatted, suddenly, the shadow trembled slightly. Over there, the Radiant King also looked over instantly, speaking in a deep voice, "Again? Has the battle for the Myriad Realms not ended?"

A special force spread, intertwining life and death, seemingly trying to summon Xingyue back.

The Human Emperor cursed, "Damn it, again?"

His curse dispelled the previous heaviness.

Everyone was speechless!

This Su Yu... was going too far!

The Human Emperor was annoyed, "Does he have to let the myriad races know? Damn it!"

What was he doing?

This Su Yu kept summoning, causing a big commotion. Didn't he know that his grandfather was very weak right now?

Suppressing such fluctuations consumed a lot of energy. If he didn't suppress it, the myriad races would find out and cause trouble. If he did suppress it, a few more times, and anyone could see his weakness.

Su Yu... damn you!

Was this guy crazy?

Summoning for no reason, what did he take his sister for?

As he thought about it, Xingyue's body trembled slightly. Soon, a force of life and death spread out. The Human Emperor had no choice but to suppress the fluctuation again, shouting, "Come back soon, or it'll be troublesome!"

"Okay!"

Xingyue responded and quickly disappeared.

The Human Emperor cursed silently, troublesome.

If this happens again, I'll slap you to death!

At this moment, others were puzzled, "Is the battle for the Myriad Realms not over, or has the human race encountered another crisis?"

The Human Emperor didn't bother to think, casually saying, "Maybe he's just bored and wants to chat with Xingyue."

Everyone was speechless!

What nonsense!

However, someone chuckled, "Maybe the Martial Emperor has revived and is causing trouble for Su Yu. Now he's summoning Xingyue to kill the Martial Emperor. Maybe the River of Time will tremble again, and the Martial Emperor will be killed!"

"Heh heh!"

"Hahaha!"

Everyone burst into laughter. This... was possible too!

The Human Emperor's shadow casually glanced at the speaker, saying nothing, but his ethereal gaze carried a deep meaning. The speaker felt awkward and embarrassed.

I was just saying, don't look at me like that. It makes me feel guilty.

Everyone laughed again.

The atmosphere was quite cheerful.

...

At this moment, Su Yu had absorbed a large amount of the power of heaven and earth and returned to his own world.

The world trembled for a moment, and a shadow appeared, intertwining life and death. Soon, Xingyue's figure emerged.

Despite being ethereal, Xingyue remained indifferent, her shadow appearing with hands behind her back, looking down at Su Yu!

"Speak, what is it?"

A cold voice echoed!

Su Yu glanced at Xingyue, not bothering with her attitude. With a wave of his hand, a chair appeared, and he gestured, "Sit down and talk, quickly!"

"Hmph!"

You want me to sit just because you say so?

I won't sit!

Xingyue continued to stand proudly. Su Yu didn't care, it was just a courtesy. Sit or don't, it was up to her.

At this moment, Su Yu didn't waste words, directly asking, "Did you see the Human Emperor?"

"Of course!"

"Is the Human Emperor injured?"

"It seems so... but I asked, and he said he's fine."

Su Yu pondered for a moment, nodding slightly, "You're someone who walks the path of life and death, and he said that. It means there's no saving him!"

"......"

Xingyue was speechless. What kind of logic was that?

But Su Yu concluded, the situation was dire. Otherwise, with Xingyue walking the path of life and death, ordinary injuries wouldn't be an issue.

Either Xingyue wasn't strong enough to save the Human Emperor, or the Human Emperor was beyond saving.

Those were the only two possibilities!

Su Yu didn't press further and asked, "How many rulers of laws are on both sides? Besides the rulers of laws, are there others?"

"On the human side, there are 42. I don't know about the other side. There are over 80 human marquises... more than a hundred people in total!"

Xingyue immediately spilled the information.

42?

Not many!

That's the truth!

Back when they left, the human race had 36 Human Kings, the Radiant King, the Human Emperor, making it 38. Adding Xingyue, that's 39. Plus over 200 human marquises...

But now, it seemed there were a few more rulers of laws, yet only a third of the human marquises remained!

Chapter 849: The Weight of War

Over the years, hundreds of Human Lords have perished.

It must be noted that those who fell were all elites. This fact is beyond doubt. The crux of the matter is that the Human Emperor was gravely injured, and his strength might not be as formidable as it once was!

"What about the Myriad Races?"

"I don't know..."

Xingyue spoke coldly, "There hasn't been a major battle for years. The other side has birthed some rulers of laws, but they remain deeply hidden! The humans are also concealing their strength, not allowing the other side to probe their reality... So now, the other side probably has around 120 rulers of laws, and they have brought more lords."

"120 rulers of laws?"

"Approximately!"

Su Yu frowned, "So, over the years, the humans haven't gained many, but the Myriad Races have increased by more than a dozen..."

Originally, the Myriad Races had 99 council members, and outside of that, there were some rulers of laws. The growth rate is similar to that of the humans, but... proportionally, the humans are in trouble!

Su Yu quickly asked, "Why haven't the Myriad Races launched a full-scale attack? Logically, they are much stronger than the humans!"

"Fear!"

"Fear of death!"

Xingyue said indifferently, "Moreover, on the Myriad Races' side, several top emperors were severely injured by my brother, so they dare not act rashly, fearing their own demise!"

To deal with the Human Emperor, the top existences would naturally be deployed. However, the other side was also heavily injured and dared not act lightly.

Su Yu furrowed his brows, "Is that the only reason? Also, aren't there human allies among the Myriad Races? Why haven't you mentioned them? Are they all within the Myriad Races' camp?"

"I didn't ask..."

"Can't rely on you for anything!" Su Yu was speechless. She didn't even bother to ask about such matters.

He quickly said, "I might go over to assist the lord soon! But... I'm worried, concerned about causing changes. If I go, I won't summon you. Summoning too much might lead to trouble. I'll use the fluctuations of the Life and Death Path to continue secret communication. Just inform the Human Emperor, and don't tell anyone else!"

"Okay!"

Xingyue responded briefly, then coldly added, "I insist on telling!"

Crazy!

Su Yu pretended she hadn't spoken. This was just her attitude; whatever you say, she will insist on the opposite. It's best to get used to it!

Su Yu said in a deep voice, "Ask the Human Emperor what help he needs, or if there's any way to help him recover. Let me know, and I'll find a way to provide some support!"

"Also, ask the Human Emperor..."

Su Yu quickly spoke for a while, finally looking at Xingyue's flickering shadow, which was trembling violently, and said, "Alright, that's it for now. You can go back!"

"That's it?"

Xingyue was somewhat annoyed, "Just that?"

Nonsense! What else could there be?

Su Yu thought for a moment, perhaps there was something else, and quickly said, "Yes, one more thing, ask the Human Emperor if he wants to bring Renshan along?"

"......"

Xingyue snorted coldly, turned around, and was about to leave.

Su Yu chuckled and added, "Also, take care of yourself, my lord. If the Myriad Races suddenly charge, retreat first, just say you're going to find reinforcements. You mustn't die, or my Life and Death Path will be finished!"

"Hmph!"

Xingyue snorted coldly and disappeared in an instant, leaving it unclear whether she was satisfied or not.

Su Yu shrugged, and only after she disappeared did he become completely serious.

What a mess!

After fighting for so many years, there are still over a hundred rulers of laws on the other side. The Human Emperor has been walking a tightrope all this time, not afraid of playing himself to death!

"The disparity in combat power is too great... There must be some internal conflicts within the Myriad Races, similar to the situation in the Myriad Realms!"

Su Yu quickly assessed the situation, yet remained extremely solemn.

To be honest, if the Human Emperor were fine, with his formidable strength, and if Su Yu could bring dozens of rulers of laws over, there wouldn't be much to fear. They might even suppress the other side!

The key is that the Human Emperor is in trouble!

He didn't even let Xingyue heal him, indicating that the injury is not ordinary!

"This is troublesome!"

In the current situation, going there would be pointless. It would be better to delay until they return, but by then, if the Gate of Hell opens again, it will be even more troublesome!

"What to do?"

"Do I have any other means?"

Su Yu kept pondering, wondering if there were any ways to enhance himself further.

The best method would be to go to the Heaven Gate and bring out the Culture King, Martial King, and Time Sage. With those three, it would be formidable, and the Myriad Races would likely be terrified.

But... the problem is, there's no way!

"Culture King..."

Su Yu murmured, there's really no way, but... Culture King... what if I impersonate the Culture King?

Let the Martial Emperor, that fool, impersonate the Martial King?

If the Martial Emperor reaches the second tier, and I impersonate the first-tier Culture King, it might work.

Then... intimidate the Myriad Races a bit?

Su Yu pondered, it's not impossible. According to the power levels back then, the Martial King was only second-tier, and the Martial Emperor could soon reach that. As for me, impersonating the first-tier Culture King isn't hopeless.

"It could be a plan!"

If the Culture King and Martial King appear, the Myriad Races probably wouldn't dare to attack easily, but it would only be a temporary deception.

Su Yu grew increasingly troubled, wondering if there were any ways to enhance himself in the Myriad Realms.

It's difficult!

There are ways, actually, like... the Human Emperor's Dao!

"Although the Human Emperor's Dao isn't fully developed, it's still a creation of the heavens. Devouring it might make me stronger, but... if I devour it and he dies, that would be even more troublesome!"

Various thoughts flashed through his mind, but Su Yu ultimately decided not to devour it.

After speaking, Su Yu suddenly held a bamboo pole in his hand, the bamboo pole of the Human Ancestor.

Perhaps this is the final means of enhancement. Heavendoom and others, who knows who will first reach the level of a ruler of laws. With luck, maybe a third-tier ruler of laws could emerge, or even stronger, but reaching the second tier should be quite challenging.

"Actually... maybe... I can try one more time!"

Su Yu's eyes suddenly flickered. Try what?

Try... resurrecting the Undead Emperor!

Why not give it a shot?

He's already at the fourth tier, but these undead, at least half of their original strength is in the Celestial River of Death. Resurrecting the Undead Emperor could at least bring him to the third tier!

That's the minimum!

And with resurrection, Su Yu's strength has increased significantly. If the Lord of the Undead appears again, Su Yu might be able to handle it.

"In that case... the Lord of the Undead might really want to kill me, having stripped away the strongest existence from his Dao!"

Who cares!

Su Yu made a decision, perhaps he could resurrect the Undead Emperor!

In doing so, a high-level combatant could emerge.

If the Martial Emperor reaches the second tier, I'm at the second tier, the bamboo pole can at least create a third-tier, and the Undead Emperor is at least third-tier. Others can become fourth-tier... There's also the Chaos Dragon, that guy is a strong fourth-tier, and if he can improve a bit, he might even reach the third tier.

In this way, the combat power would increase significantly.

"The key is... maybe I can take this opportunity to enhance Liu Hong! While resurrecting someone, expand his Dao!"

Resurrecting the Undead Emperor is a good choice.

This time, only one person needs to be resurrected.

The others don't matter.

Moreover, there are no strong beings in the Death Realm now.

"Once the Undead Emperor is resurrected, it will almost be time..."

Su Yu sensed that some people in his world were about to advance. Indeed, without pressure, it's impossible to progress.
