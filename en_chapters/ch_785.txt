Chapter 785: Peak Combat Power (Subscription Request)

With Xingyue's revival, this journey of revival has come to a complete end!

Su Yu has returned.

He emerged from the River of Time, entered the Celestial River of Death, and quickly returned to the Death Realm. The fluctuations of the Celestial River of Death gradually calmed down. The fleeting presence of the Lord of the Undead may have vanished completely, or perhaps it will reappear the next time someone attempts to revive and devour the source. If that happens, it will surely reemerge!

The situation in the Death Realm has undergone a tremendous change. The North King is dead, Dragonblood is dead, and fourteen top-tier experts in the Sealed Land have perished. Among the powerful undead in the Celestial River of Death, those who died are gone, and those who survived, like the Fire God Race's Tianhuo, have now merged into Su Yu's world.

Su Yu's world has expanded significantly!

At this moment, Su Yu's strength has also grown considerably, and his Great Dao has become much more complete. Xingyue has merged with the Dao of Life and Death, taking away Su Yu's Dao of Life and Death. However, this Dao belongs to Su Yu's world, and if Xingyue becomes stronger, these two Daos will also become stronger, thereby further perfecting Su Yu's world.

There are both advantages and disadvantages!

Xingyue took away Su Yu's Dao of Life and Death. If Xingyue were to die, the cycle of the Dao of Life and Death in Su Yu's world would be disrupted, causing turmoil in the entire world. However, if she strengthens the two Daos, it will also benefit Su Yu's world. This depends on Xingyue's situation.

...

In the new world.

There are 26 revived undead, almost all of whom are Su Yu's subordinates, but a few are not, such as Tianhuo. As for strength, at this time, the South King is the strongest. When Su Yu stepped into this world, he suddenly felt that within this world, he, the master, might not even be stronger than the South King, which is quite terrifying.

Of course, this is only within the world. Once outside, Su Yu is still Su Yu, while the South King may not be the same South King.

The drawbacks of the pseudo-path are vividly evident at this time. Marquis Lanshan, here, possesses top-tier Heavenly King strength, even approaching Heavenly Sovereign power, but outside, at best, he is just entering the Heavenly King realm. On the other hand, Tianhuo, even outside, has Heavenly King strength, and not a weak one at that.

Others have also improved. For instance, Hetu, here, barely seems to have a bit of Heavenly King strength. Xia Chen is probably a second-tier Daofuse, also nearing the Heavenly King domain, while others like Marquis Zhengyang are second or third-tier Daofuse, not far from the Heavenly King.

These 26 strong individuals vary in strength, but even those who were previously Eternal, after merging with the source, mostly possess Daofuse strength. This is a group of strong individuals, a total of 26.

Guarding this side, there are 31 strong individuals. Just these two groups of strong individuals amount to 57, plus other strong individuals from various races, human strong individuals, and ancient strong individuals...

At this moment, Su Yu's side is truly filled with strong individuals!

Su Yu landed.

At this time, everyone also returned one after another. Giant Axe and March also arrived. Seeing the previously scattered people gathering, once they entered this world, Giant Axe and March were secretly shocked!

Outside, some people's strength seemed ordinary. However, for instance, the Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, once they entered, their auras surged, instantly transforming into Heavenly King-level existences, which is terrifying!

Previously outside, there were more than ten Heavenly Kings. Once inside, there were almost 20!

Moreover, the South King and others, here, gave Giant Axe the feeling that even he couldn't match the South King. Not to mention the South King, he might not even be able to match Tianhuo here, while Marquis Lanshan's aura was not much different from his.

March was also shocked!

Looking around, it wasn't a large place, just the size of a small town or the territory of a mountain of the Iron Devourer Race. However, this place seemed completely different from the outside world.

Here, it wasn't the Death Realm, but it also wasn't like the Myriad Realms.

While March was thinking about these things, Su Yu smiled and said, "Senior March, this time, thanks to you and Senior Giant Axe for coming to assist in the battle, otherwise, I wouldn't know how to handle it!"

This was just a polite remark!

Their absence wouldn't have made much difference. At that time, Su Yu had already used the Sanctification Seal, and defeating those people was just a matter of time. The real factor that could have affected Su Yu's plan was the Undead Emperor. If the other party had intervened, there would have been changes this time.

But since the other party didn't intervene, everything was actually within Su Yu's plan. Without full preparation, Su Yu wouldn't dare to act rashly. Since he dared, it meant he was almost ready!

March quickly said, "Emperor Yu, you're too kind!"

Giant Axe hesitated, thought for a moment, and didn't speak.

Su Yu, however, smiled and said, "Senior Giant Axe, this is the first time I've seen you. I've only heard of your name before, but now that I've met you, your strength is indeed extraordinary!"

Giant Axe awkwardly replied, "Emperor Yu's place is filled with strong individuals. I thought..."

Forget it, better not say it.

I thought your side was really pitiful.

He stopped there but still said, "So... those people didn't die?"

He thought they were all gone!

Su Yu smiled and nodded, "Of course, they didn't die. I just didn't want to become the balance point between the Chaos Race and the Myriad Races, so I took the opportunity to leave with them."

"That's good!"

Giant Axe breathed a sigh of relief and said, "I was worried that because of saving me, Emperor Yu's side suffered heavy losses, and I felt guilty. Now I feel much lighter."

Su Yu chuckled, "Feeling guilty... that's better than many people! But there's no need for you to feel that way, Senior. The Myriad Races released you as just an attempt, hoping you could lend them a hand, which is why they were willing to release you."

With that, Su Yu smiled and said, "Let's not talk about this for now, Senior, just let it go!"

After Su Yu finished speaking, he looked at Tianhuo. At this moment, Tianhuo was accompanied by four people, all Daofuse. A group of five, these were the outsiders this time. The rest were all dead.

Seeing Su Yu looking over, Tianhuo said in a deep voice, "Thank you, Emperor Yu, for your help!"

Revived!

This time, they got a big bargain. The danger wasn't too great, of course, those who faced danger were all gone.

Su Yu looked at them and said calmly, "No need for pleasantries, it's meaningless! You chose to merge with my world, so you probably know what that means. I don't like to say polite words to people I'm not familiar with! Here, you and I are connected. If something happens to me, it's not good for you, and if something happens to you, it also damages my Dao power!"

Tianhuo said solemnly, "I have sensed it. Since we chose to merge with Emperor Yu's Dao, whether it's out of necessity, acceptance, or gratitude, we will all fight for Emperor Yu!"

He didn't say they were convinced, that's for the future. At this moment, they are not familiar.

Now they must serve Su Yu!

If they don't, they can choose to sever the Dao and leave, reverting to the Sunmoon Realm, and then... die of old age!

Yes, they will definitely die!

Their lifespan is calculated based on their previous life. How long can a Sunmoon live? Without Su Yu's Dao power, they cannot be accommodated by other Daos and can only die of old age instantly.

Su Yu laughed, "I like sensible people. I'm just afraid of those who are blind, that would be bad. At this moment, if anyone dares to bargain with me, there will be some grudges left!"

"We dare not!"

Tianhuo cupped his hands. On Su Yu's territory, using his Dao, if you still want to bargain, that would be too foolish. Moreover, who isn't afraid of Su Yu's many methods?

There were many strong individuals in the Sealed Land, right?

And now, what happened?

Most of them are dead!

Su Yu nodded slightly and looked towards the Sealed Land, suddenly smiling and cupping his hands, "Congratulations to the Emperor!"

His voice spread, and in the distance, the Undead Emperor opened his eyes and said calmly, "What is there to congratulate? It should be congratulations to Emperor Su!"

Su Yu laughed, "There is indeed something to celebrate. This time, with a large number of undead dead, the South King and others revived, and the source in the Celestial River of Death calmed down. I think the next step is the best time for the Emperor to enhance himself! There are also strong and weak among the rulers of the rules. I think the Emperor may soon step into the next realm!"

Yes, there is no competition anymore!

Those who competed are either dead or revived, which is also a development period for the weaker undead. At this moment, if the opportunity is right, becoming an undead Heavenly King or even a Heavenly Sovereign is not difficult!

On Su Yu's side, there are still some undead. Not everyone has the courage to revive, including some Daofuse, who haven't done so.

These people also have a development opportunity next.

At this time, Su Yu's side has reached an extreme in terms of combat power.

And he himself is much stronger than when he first opened the Dao, because more and more people have merged into his Dao, expanding the world he controls. At this time, Su Yu's personal combat power is also rising.

At this moment, under Su Yu's command, there are many strong individuals.

Heavenly Sovereign level: March, Giant Axe, Fat Ball, South King

Pseudo-Heavenly Sovereign: Tianhuo, Lanshan

Heavenly King: Lantian, Wan Tiansheng, Great Zhou King, Doubao, Flatbread, September, Fate Emperor, Huoyun, Marquis Giant Bamboo, Consort Qi, Hongmeng

Pseudo-Heavenly King: Great Qin King, Great Xia King, Topsoil Spirit, Yingwu, Hou Pseudo Emperor, June, Space Beast Emperor, Hetu

The pseudo-Heavenly Sovereigns Tianhuo and Lanshan can barely exert Heavenly King combat power in the outside world, while the South King can truly exert Heavenly Sovereign combat power. If she were in Su Yu's world, she might be able to fight a battle with the ancestors of the Control King's lineage.

This is the harvest of this time!

A huge harvest!

Such strength, if spread, is also terrifying, probably not weaker than any other side.

Lantian actually has a faint feeling of being a Heavenly Sovereign, but this guy keeps self-destructing his avatars, healing and injuring, injuring and healing, and you never know when he might advance.

The Hou Pseudo Emperor and Topsoil Spirit have all merged into Su Yu's world. In this world, although Topsoil Spirit entered Daofuse later, because the Five Elemental Race is perfecting his Five Elemental Dao, this guy has come from behind.

In this world, there are more than 20 individuals with Heavenly King combat power!

And Su Yu, looking around, is surrounded by strong individuals.

He is in a good mood.

Even Heavendoom, in his own world, could probably be considered a second-tier Daofuse expert. In one's own world, comprehending the Dao is actually easier, and everyone will have a period of improvement rather than stagnation.

Pseudo-dao... Su Yu didn't think his side was a pseudo-dao. It was just that the owner of this world wasn't as strong as the Master of Time, and it had nothing to do with the authenticity of the Great Dao.

Among the ancient powerhouses, the only one still alive was the unfortunate Marquis Dingjun, who was still second-tier. He hadn't integrated into Su Yu's world yet. The reason? This guy was fixated on merging with the Spear Dao.

Now that the Spear Dao was gone, even similar paths like the Halberd Dao had been merged by Marquis Lanshan, and the Staff Dao had been merged by Heavendoom. Su Yu thought this guy was really out of luck, always a step behind, and now there seemed to be no suitable Great Dao for him.

As Su Yu was pondering, Marquis Dingjun himself felt a bit inferior. Outside, it wasn't much of a problem. The Great Qin King and others were about the same as him. His old friend Yingwu was also comparable outside. But once inside... well, he was surrounded by Heavenly Kings, and he was the only one who seemed pitiful, struggling to stand firm in the first circle due to the overwhelming aura of these powerhouses.

Damn it, I seem to be falling out of the first rank!

Su Yu was the core, and now, more than twenty powerhouses stood around him. Marquis Dingjun barely stood in the first circle, but he felt he would soon be pushed out.

Seeing Su Yu deep in thought, he couldn't help but whisper, "Your Majesty, is there any Great Dao in this world suitable for me?"

I want to merge with a Dao!

Previously, the Great Qin King merged with the Spear Dao faster than him, so he thought he could take his time. But in the blink of an eye, the Halberd and Staff Daos were all gone. What should I do now?

Su Yu squinted and smiled, "You want to merge with a Dao?"

"Yes!" Marquis Dingjun nodded eagerly, a bit helpless. "Your Majesty, but... there's no suitable Great Dao for me!"

I also want to become a Master of Laws! If I end up fighting others, wouldn't that be troublesome?

"There is!" Su Yu laughed. "I told you to merge with a Dao long ago, but you didn't. Now you're coming to me. If I weren't free now, I wouldn't even bother with you. There's still a Pike Dao and a Lance Dao left. Choose one! Actually, the Pike is hard to master, but the Lance isn't much different from a spear. Just extend your spear a bit! I saved it just for you!"

This last sentence made Marquis Dingjun overjoyed. Saved just for me? My face... is so strong!

Of course, Su Yu was just saying that. No one had merged with it yet. He continued, "For warriors, it's better to merge with a Dao early. Unlike cultural researchers, who have a wide range of choices, warriors have fewer options!"

This was also true. Many people used the common warrior paths.

With a casual wave, Su Yu presented a Great Dao and no longer paid attention to Marquis Dingjun. He could handle it himself. It wasn't his first time merging with a Dao. Many people had done it last time, and Marquis Dingjun had watched, so there shouldn't be any problems.

Su Yu looked at the crowd and smiled, "Everyone's strength has improved quite a bit! Next, there will be one last enhancement. I'll go shatter and extract the Dao of the Desolate Beast to help everyone restore their full physical strength! In the short term, there might not be many opportunities for enlightenment!"

Everyone was delighted. There's still one more chance! Following Su Yu was like having three meals a day, while not following him was like having one meal every three days!

Su Yu left his world here and flew back with the crowd. Behind them, Marquis Dingjun was in a hurry, eagerly merging with the Dao, shouting as he did, "Your Majesty, take your time shattering the Dao of the Desolate Beast, wait for me!"

Heavendoom chuckled, "It's gone. When you return, there'll be nothing left!"

Marquis Dingjun cursed silently, impatient beyond measure.

Damn it! If I had known, I would have merged with a Dao sooner.

Su Yu couldn't be bothered with him, leading the group to fly once more towards the Sealed Land.

In the Sealed Land, fifteen pillars of light remained, now only one stood alone.

The Undead Emperor opened his eyes and looked at Su Yu.

Su Yu also looked at him and smiled, "Previously, Director Wan promised on my behalf to help unseal you!"

The Undead Emperor remained silent.

Su Yu continued, "Wait a little while longer. Once I'm done with my current tasks, I'll help unseal you! Don't worry, it won't take long, at least faster than the Martial Emperor. This way, you won't have any conflicts with my people."

"There's no need for Su Emperor to rush," the Undead Emperor replied calmly. "Sooner or later, it's all the same. Unsealing now doesn't benefit me much. It's also good to calmly comprehend the Dao of the Undead."

"The Emperor is quite open-minded!" Su Yu laughed and said no more, leading his people away.

The group flew towards the Abyssal Realm.

In the distance, the Martial Emperor seemed to be spying again. Su Yu vaguely sensed it but couldn't be bothered. The Martial Emperor, on the other hand, felt a bit despondent, wanting to curse.

What the hell!

Recently, the sense of impending death was too obvious. Every day, someone seemed to be chanting that he was done for. Was it Su Yu?

If not Su Yu, who else would be so idle, chanting all day that I'm done for?

Is this even human?

I'm alive and well!

Now, he was starting to doubt his own crisis sense. Am I really done for?

At this moment, seeing Su Yu leading so many powerhouses towards the Abyssal Realm, he felt a toothache. They were getting stronger and more numerous.

Clearly, my unsealing is just around the corner, so why... why does it feel increasingly dangerous?

It was supposed to be that after unsealing, I'd kill this bastard.

But... how do I kill him now?

Su Yu's own strength was terrifyingly strong now, not to mention he had so many powerhouses under his command.

"Not afraid... After unsealing, I'll be stronger than the average Master of Laws!"

There are different levels among Masters of Laws, and I'm not weak. Why should I fear Su Yu?

What use is having many people!

Alright, having many people seems nice, at least there are more heads to kill.

The Martial Emperor entertained himself, feeling that life was becoming unbearable.

...

Abyssal Realm.

When March and Giant Axe entered, they were stunned.

Is this still the Abyssal Realm?

This is practically a cultivation paradise!

Indeed, what we thought was nonsense. March had already seen it. In the distance, a massive bamboo mountain stood, covered in bamboo, with many Iron Devourer Beasts eating, drinking, and sleeping!

Their lives were much more comfortable than ours.

The entire realm was full of source qi, with clear mountains and rivers, birds singing and flowers blooming!

Even the power of laws was abundant.

We thought you were living a hard life, but you are truly living like immortals!

Comfortable!

Giant Axe also looked around, secretly smacking his lips. Damn, it's really comfortable!

This place is more comfortable than the Human Realm.

Who said Su Yu was living a miserable life?

Nonsense!

March seemed to remember something and quickly said, "Your Majesty, I remembered something. This time we descended, it was actually with the tacit approval of the myriad races, hoping we would take Tiangu and the others up, which is why they gave Thunderstorm and me the chance to descend!"

"Marquis Giant Bamboo and the others were all used as hostages, right?" Su Yu asked with a smile. March nodded, "Yes, our clansmen above are all considered hostages, all over there!"

Su Yu laughed, "Then take them up! If you don't, Thunderstorm will! Now Hundred Battle is eager for a fight above, and the myriad races are worried about trouble below. Sending people up can show that the lower realm has no intention of participating in the war."

March nodded slightly and quickly added, "By the way, there have been some changes in the Upper Realm. In the Chaos Mountain area, two top-tier powerhouses suddenly appeared, an Eight-Winged Tiger and a Tailless Dragon..."

Everyone's eyes turned strange.

Fat Ball muttered, "That tiger actually went up? Will it betray us? And that dragon went up too. We broke its tail. Will it seek revenge?"

March and Giant Axe were stunned. Damn!

This is related to you too?

Su Yu said calmly, "The Eight-Winged Tiger probably won't, but the Chaos Dragon is hard to say... However, it might not dare. It should have heard the Culture King's voice. No matter, even if it does betray us, so what? Will the myriad races believe it? As long as one side doesn't believe, it doesn't matter! I suffered heavy losses last time, they saw it. Would they take the word of a Chaos Beast seriously?"

Compared to the Chaos Race, at least from Su Yu's perspective, it wasn't much of a threat.

March nodded slightly, then suddenly remembered something and quickly took out a large ice block, saying urgently, "This is General Xuelan. What should we do with her?"

Su Yu was surprised, "Why is she with you?"

Last time, Xuelan's body exploded, which Su Yu saw. It wasn't her initiative to self-destruct, but rather her opponent forced her to, causing her body to shatter, and a freezing power sealed her.

This was a form of self-protection. Su Yu scanned it and knew the seal wasn't weak. Ordinary Heavenly Sovereigns would struggle to break it.

How did she end up with March?

Su Yu had thought she was taken by the Chaos Race.

March explained briefly, and Giant Axe hesitated but still said, "Xuelan is the daughter of the Snow King, the legitimate daughter. The Snow King might not have fallen. Saving Xuelan... might still be useful! And Xuelan isn't a bad person..."

Last time, he and several powerhouses were captured together.

As a result, Nanxi and the others followed Hundred Battle, while he came to Su Yu's side, and Xuelan self-sealed.

Su Yu laughed, "She's not obedient!"

Giant Axe said awkwardly, "She... she's not very familiar with Emperor Yu. Self-destructing... that's a death sentence. I think... maybe it's because she's not familiar. Once she gets familiar, it'll be fine!"

Su Yu nodded slightly, smiling, "True! But even if she's not familiar... Senior Giant Axe, let me ask you, during ancient times, if you were under the Martial King's command and were transferred to the Culture King's command, would you dare to disobey orders on the battlefield?"

Su Yu spoke indifferently, "This isn't about familiarity. I'm the master, and they are soldiers! I am the current Human Lord, and since that's the case, it's my responsibility to save them. If I lead them into battle, they must follow orders without question! If I command them to charge as a suicide squad, then they must do so! It's as simple as that!"

"That's a military order, not a personal favor. Do you understand what I mean, Giant Axe?"

Su Yu glanced around, his gaze landing on Tianhuo and the others, his tone cold, "In daily life, you can laugh and joke as you please. But on the battlefield, you're soldiers, just soldiers! I am the master, and on the battlefield, there will only be one voice!"

"If I say self-detonate, then you self-detonate. If you trust me, do it. If you don't trust me... you still have to do it. Not doing so is defying military orders!"

Everyone was solemn.

At this moment, the Great Qin King interjected, "Of course, on the battlefield, orders must be followed without question. This is something that must be adhered to at all times! On the battlefield, there are no personal feelings, no right to choose tasks. If you can go, you must go. If you can't go, you still have to go! We are still in wartime, and wartime military discipline is a must, regardless of strength!"

Giant Axe felt a bit embarrassed.

Su Yu looked at Giant Axe and smiled, "However... Giant Axe, you've come all this way, knowing my strength is greatly diminished, yet you still came to aid me. For that, I can give you some face!"

Su Yu chuckled, "There's no need for Snow King's gratitude. I don't care about such things!"

"Giant Axe, the fact that Xuelan was saved and unsealed this time is credited to you!"

Giant Axe was a bit embarrassed, "This..."

Su Yu laughed, "No need to say more, senior. You decide whether to save her or not! If not, we can keep her sealed and find an opportunity to throw her out later. Keeping her here isn't a solution! Or you can take the ice block and keep it as a collection!"

Giant Axe was even more helpless. Count it as mine? I... I'm not even that familiar with Xuelan. But if it's credited to me, does that mean I owe another life? How troublesome.

He looked again at the ice-sealed Xuelan. Su Yu continued, "This is also an opportunity for revival. I need to split open the Dao of the Desolate Beast, using the power of the physical body to help everyone recover. If she isn't unsealed now, even if she recovers, restoring her physical body later... maybe Hundred Battle can help, otherwise, it will be difficult!"

Yes, Giant Axe remembered! Xuelan's physical body was also shattered. If she doesn't recover now, it will indeed be difficult later.

Thinking of this, Giant Axe grinned, "Then... then I ask Emperor Yu to save her. Although I'm not very familiar with Xuelan, Snow King... is quite beautiful!"

"......"

Everyone was stunned by this sudden statement.

What does that mean? We thought you were interested in Xuelan, but it turns out you're interested in her mother?

Beside him, Marquis Huoyun couldn't hold back and muttered, "Giant Axe, are you interested in Snow King too?"

He grinned, "Isn't there some gossip about Snow King and Martial King?"

Giant Axe scolded, "Nonsense! Even if Martial King has thoughts, Snow King wouldn't be interested. Snow King is a pure and virtuous woman!"

Damn! Everyone cursed inwardly. What gossip! How did Martial King get involved again?

Now, some were curious. Heavendoom asked blankly, "Xuelan isn't Martial King's daughter, is she?"

"Nonsense!"

Giant Axe shook his head, "Ridiculous! Xuelan is not. Xuelan was born before Snow King became a king. I know her father, met him a few times. Of course, it's quite ancient, Huoyun might know."

Marquis Huoyun nodded. He indeed knew, but couldn't help adding, "He died a bit early. Xuelan was born over 30 years after his death."

"......"

Everyone's eyes grew more peculiar. What a big piece of gossip!

Giant Axe was speechless, "Nonsense, back then, it was during a great war. Snow King sealed the pregnancy process. You know this, Huoyun. Are you deliberately stirring up trouble?"

For the strong, who said you have to give birth the same year you conceive? If you don't want to give birth yet, seal it first and give birth when you want!

He defended himself a bit, and everyone understood, nodding in agreement. They said no more.

But their eyes were all very peculiar.

Giant Axe, could he really be interested in Snow King? This guy, truly deep and unfathomable!

No wonder he was eager to unseal Xuelan, wanting to be her father!

Su Yu just smiled, saying nothing more. He reached out, grabbing the ice block, examining it carefully, and said with a smile, "This path of ice sealing is quite interesting. Under normal circumstances, it's hard to break. It's a good life-saving technique!"

With that, a special flame emerged from his hand, different from ordinary flames, cold and piercing.

The flame rose, gradually unsealing the ice block.

Moments later, a light sphere appeared, and the next moment, General Xuelan condensed into a human form. Seeing Su Yu, she was somewhat surprised.

Su Yu... is here? Then where am I?

She glanced around, astonished by the number of strong individuals present, and those she saw self-destruct last time were still alive!

Su Yu didn't give her a chance to speak, saying indifferently, "Giant Axe asked me to unseal you and restore your physical body. From now on, you follow Giant Axe. For this, Giant Axe will serve me!"

Xuelan was extremely surprised. Giant Axe was embarrassed, "No, no, it's all thanks to Emperor Yu's generosity!"

Su Yu laughed, "Alright, it's a small matter! I'll guide the Dao of the Desolate Beast later, and everyone can restore their physical bodies, including Xuelan!"

Although Xuelan was still full of doubts, it didn't seem like the right time to ask questions.

Where is this place? The Human Realm? Is the Human Realm like this?

She vaguely felt it wasn't, but if this wasn't the Human Realm, then where was it?

So many strong individuals!

Last time, she communicated with Yingwu and the others, and they didn't mention so many strong individuals. Also, how long have I been sealed?

Why does it feel like those who self-destructed last time have grown much stronger?

A hundred years? A thousand years?

For a moment, Xuelan didn't know how much time had passed.

...

At this moment, Su Yu walked to the place where he had previously guided the Great Dao, where he had dug a pit in the River of Time.

From here, he could guide the Dao of the Desolate Beast.

The Dao of the Desolate Beast had been sealed by the Culture King, and later, Su Yu handed it over to the Great Qin King and the others. Now, it was in an unclaimed state again.

He also wanted to see what Xingyue had left for him.

In Su Yu's hand appeared a drop of blood, the blood of the Desolate Beast, which he had saved earlier. Now, he activated the blood, and a wild power emerged, with a faint Great Dao appearing.

Now, Su Yu had a deeper understanding of the Great Dao. Even if the Dao of the Desolate Beast wasn't here, he could guide it over just the same.

Moments later, Su Yu opened the Heaven Gate, already seeing a power of the Great Dao extending over!

Soon, the power of the Great Dao extended down through the opening.

Su Yu reached out, tearing the void!

The next moment, he stepped into the River of Time.

Soon, he saw the tributary of the Desolate Beast.

Su Yu stepped into the tributary, initially encountering resistance, but it quickly disappeared. Su Yu sensed it and smiled. This was sealed by his own power of life and death, so it didn't hinder him. Others trying to enter would find it troublesome.

As he entered, he was slightly stunned.

Such a rich life force, such a rich power of the physical body.

"Where did this come from?"

Strange!

Even if Xingyue had revived, even if she controlled the Dao of Life, she had just revived, not for long. Where did she get so much power of the physical body and life force?

Moreover, it wasn't wild; it was tamed, domesticated!

This was even stranger!

"Could it be left from before?"

Su Yu could only guess this way. He hadn't expected Xingyue to go find Hundred Battle and extract the life force and power of the physical body from that group.

Su Yu laughed, well, that's good!

The power of the physical body was something he needed now. He was worried one Desolate Beast's power wouldn't be enough, but now, it was sufficient.

As for the life force, it was actually quite good. It could heal, strengthen the physical body, enhance life force, and restore lifespan... but Su Yu didn't care much. Xingyue might have left it to help him restore his lifespan.

But it wasn't necessary!

Su Yu felt that if he could improve, he would definitely have a breakthrough within ten years!

By then, he could naturally recover.

If he couldn't improve, ten years later... it probably wouldn't take that long before he was done for. Lifespan, really, didn't matter. Ten years was more than enough!

Three years were more than enough!

"Moreover, once my own Dao of Life is strong, I can naturally replenish my lifespan!"

Lifespan is also a good thing, something some old fellows might need.

After all, approaching the limit of lifespan can lead to a decline in state!

"Giant Axe, March, Huoyun... these people aren't young. Absorbing some life force can help them recover better, reaching a peak state!"

And the newly revived South King and others also needed it.

After revival, their life force wasn't very strong.

Very good!

Su Yu smiled. The power Xingyue left was urgently needed now, saving him a lot of trouble. Now, everyone could probably recover sufficiently!

"It seems her memory has indeed recovered a lot..."

Su Yu chuckled, a bit puzzled. Xingyue had lived for hundreds of thousands of years, and as a dead spirit, countless years. Could she really remember just these few years?

But thinking carefully... maybe she could.

No choice, being a shut-in for hundreds of thousands of years, it seems... she only tended to flowers and plants. Maybe she was like this in life too. For such a shut-in, you can't guess what else is in her memory besides tending to flowers and plants.

"Terrifyingly reclusive!"

Su Yu shook his head, no longer thinking about it. The next moment, he shouted, suddenly punching out, directly causing the Dao of the Desolate Beast to tremble violently!

Su Yu wanted to forcibly split open this Dao, letting all the power leak out!

Other Daos, either had masters or were fused with someone. Attacking them would mean a deadly battle.

This Dao, Su Yu was clear about it, completely unclaimed. Punching a hole, no one would care.

...

Boom!

The sky collapsed and the earth caved in!

In the sky, a massive rift suddenly appeared. Su Yu emerged from it, followed by a surge of physical power and vitality. With a smile, he announced, "Restore your bodies, strengthen your vitality, elders!"

Without needing further instruction, everyone began to absorb the powerful physical energy. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, in particular, devoured it at an astonishing speed. Having already mastered this path, they absorbed the overflowing physical power with fervor.

Su Yu's eyes flickered as he glanced at some figures in the distance. With a grin, he called out, "Great Jin King, Great Chu King... see if you can seize this opportunity to draw more physical power and directly advance to the Daofuse Realm!"

These Human Lords, who had yet to advance, exchanged glances. Suddenly, the Great Jin King raised his voice, "Your Majesty, if we absorb this physical power and advance to the Daofuse Realm, can we carry this power into your world and help establish a new path of the physical body?"

Su Yu looked at them and chuckled, nodding. "You can, but... do you really need to create a path akin to the Great Dao of Time?"

"We... are warriors!" they replied helplessly. As warriors, they were destined to have strong physical bodies. The path of weapons had been claimed by others, leaving them no choice but to forge a new path of the physical body. At worst, they would become kings of the physical realm!

Su Yu laughed and nodded. At that moment, these former Human Lords, who had yet to change their paths, began to draw physical power to advance. After advancing, they had no interest in competing with the Human Realm and Hundred Battle King for the path of the physical body. Instead, they chose to integrate into Su Yu's Great Dao, creating a new path of the physical body and becoming pioneers of this path.

In no time, several more Daofuse experts emerged. Meanwhile, others rapidly restored their physical bodies. Su Yu's external world expanded once more. The stronger they became, the stronger Su Yu became, as they perfected his Great Dao.

He was growing stronger effortlessly!

With this, Su Yu's forces reached a new peak. The Great Qin King and the Great Xia King, having fully restored their physical bodies, seemed on the verge of stepping into an even more powerful realm. Could they become pseudo-Heavenly Sovereigns ahead of time? If so, they would be Heavenly Kings in the outside world!

Su Yu harbored a small hope, wishing for these individuals to grow even stronger. Ideally, they would all become Heavenly Sovereigns, ruling over his Great Dao as masters of laws. Even if their power diminished, they would still be formidable enough to suppress the current myriad realms!

"Protect the Heavenly Overseer Marquis well. Eventually, my side will become the strongest!"

Yes, protect the Heavenly Overseer Marquis! At that moment, Su Yu suddenly had this thought. Since he had separated from the Great Dao of Time, he didn't rely on killing the Heavenly Overseer Marquis to promote his subordinates to masters of laws. He needed to protect him! As long as the Heavenly Overseer Marquis lived, his side would eventually become the strongest!

Watching everyone recover, Su Yu calculated and sighed, "I've been away from the Human Realm for over a month!"

So long! I've left the Human Realm for over a month, and time has flown by.

Beside him, Fat Ball, who didn't need to restore its physical body, glanced at Su Yu with a peculiar expression, wagging its tail. Over a month... is that long? I've been watering flowers for hundreds of thousands of years! Why does listening to Su Yu's lament make a month seem so long?
