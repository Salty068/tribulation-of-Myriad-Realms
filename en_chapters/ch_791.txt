Chapter 791: The Change of the Three Clans

"Your Majesty, weren't you worried they might have attacked just now?"

At this moment, Giant Axe was sweating a bit, feeling a lingering fear. The Heavenly Sovereigns of the myriad races were numerous. If they had truly attacked, the four of them might not have been able to withstand it.

"Hmm?" Su Yu was puzzled. "Why would they attack? Are the myriad races insane?"

"We're here to help, even sending people over. We've been so friendly. Aside from the Dragon Race, which we've killed quite a few of, why would the others risk their lives to attack their reinforcements?"

Reinforcements? Giant Axe inwardly grumbled. You don't have good intentions; how can this be considered reinforcements?

Su Yu laughed, "Don't worry. If the myriad races really dared to attack, they would have done so to the Eight-Winged Tiger and the others long ago. Why wait until now? These people have strength, talent, and a fighting spirit, but they lack one thing... they can't reach a consensus. They all have their own little schemes!"

For example, the Dragon Heavenly Sovereign worries that if he dies, the Dragon Race will be finished. The Phoenix Heavenly Sovereign fears that if she falls, the Phoenix Race will be doomed. The Dao Heavenly Sovereign is concerned that if he perishes, the Immortal Race will be suppressed... They all have the same mindset!

In truth, such thoughts are the most feared in a great war. The myriad races lack an excellent leader. If they could truly unite their forces, they wouldn't be weak at all.

Even now, with Dao, Nether, Desolate, Demon, Mo, Sun, Moon, Dragon, and Phoenix, that's nine Heavenly Sovereigns. Additionally, Thunderstorm and Destiny are still serving, making a total of eleven Heavenly Sovereign-level powerhouses.

March has fled, but that's just March. Eleven Heavenly Sovereign-level existences, and that's not all. The Immortal and Demon races have at least one hidden, making it thirteen. Add the former Empress, and there are fourteen top-tier existences, plus many Heavenly King-level beings, totaling over ten.

With such strength, they are certainly stronger than Su Yu's side. The key is, who can control the power of the myriad races? That's the core issue!

Upon hearing this, both Giant Axe and March nodded. Giant Axe chuckled, "Your Majesty is right. If they could truly cooperate, they would have done so long ago. Back in the day, when we fought the Myriad Realms, we also defeated them one by one!"

It seems the myriad races have never truly cooperated, except when the Human Emperor led them away, forcing them to unite.

"Let's head to Bamboo Mountain first!" Su Yu didn't say much more. For now, they needed to establish a foothold in the Upper Realm. Once the myriad races send the Iron Devourer Race over, they can discuss other matters.

...

At the same time, everyone silently watched as Su Yu and his group departed. They looked at each other, speechless for a long time.

At this moment, the former Empress, appearing aged and frail, coughed lightly, "Let's head back!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign quickly said, "Empress, we've all moved to Ren Mountain now, and the myriad races of the Upper Realm are gathering."

"That's a good thing." The former Empress nodded slightly. Indeed, it was a good thing. She pondered for a moment and asked, "Did Su Yu suffer a defeat when he ascended to the Upper Realm?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign briefly recounted the events. The former Empress thought for a while before saying, "Not necessarily. It might have been a diversion tactic. Forget it; even if Su Yu has accumulated strength, he probably doesn't have any immediate plans against us. His primary target is still the Control King's lineage."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign was speechless. Did the Empress mean that Su Yu's previous defeat might have been just a smokescreen? That couldn't be, right?

While they were discussing, Tiangu and the person who came to meet him had already joined forces. At this moment, Tiangu turned his head to look at Dao and Desolate Heavenly Sovereigns, saying calmly, "You two, return to the Immortal Race's base. I have something to discuss!"

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign and Dao Heavenly Sovereign exchanged glances, nodded slightly to Moon Heavenly Sovereign and the others, and quickly flew over.

The former Empress glanced at them, coughed a few times, and said, "With Tiangu in the Upper Realm, I wonder who can lead the Immortal Race! As for our God Race..."

She looked at Jiwu, "Jiwu, your strength is insufficient. For now, let Sun and Moon Heavenly Sovereigns take charge of the clan's affairs."

Jiwu nodded slightly.

The former Empress coughed continuously, her aura fluctuating. "Moon Eclipse, you and Sun Corona... If it were back in the day, you would have already been rulers of the laws, transcending the mundane. Let Jiwu handle the minor affairs of the clan for now. Once the seal is broken, you will both be rulers of the laws, and you won't need to concern yourselves with trivial matters. Focus more on cultivation."

Moon Heavenly Sovereign nodded slightly. The former Empress had high seniority and status. Since she had ascended to the Upper Realm, they had to give her face.

The former Empress's coughing grew heavier. "The Control King's lineage must be eradicated. I'm not entirely clear on the specifics, but it's said that there's a top-tier powerhouse among them, right?"

"Yes."

The former Empress was silent for a moment before speaking, "I'm going to die soon. I probably won't live to see the return of the former Emperor. Leave this person to me. I'll use my last battle to deal with them! Besides this person, you and Sun Corona should kill another Heavenly Sovereign... cough, cough..."

She coughed, looking around at the others, gasping, "We must act quickly. Su Yu's ascension to the Upper Realm won't be peaceful! First, eliminate the Control King's lineage at the smallest cost, then join forces... join forces to deal with Su Yu and his group!"

Her speech grew increasingly urgent. "The Upper Realm might not take Su Yu seriously. Even if he has several Heavenly Sovereigns on his side, they might underestimate him. But in my view... Su Yu is even more troublesome than the Control King's lineage! The Control King's lineage is nothing. They've been dormant for a hundred thousand years without making a splash. It can only be said that we underestimated them before. Now that we know of their existence... they are strong enemies, but not mortal enemies!"

Everyone was shocked. Moon Heavenly Sovereign couldn't help but ask, "Does the Empress mean that Su Yu's side is even more troublesome than the Control King's lineage?"

"Of course!"

The former Empress nodded. "In just three or four years, he's stirred up the Myriad Realms, waging war across the lower realms. Don't say the lower realms are weak... the lower realms are weak, but the Human Race is even weaker! Tiangu and Jiwu are not fools. They've already greatly overestimated Su Yu, sending the strongest forces to kill him time and again... By the third time, Tiangu and the others personally took action!"

They acted personally by the third time! That's the ruler of a race! Who would send their own ruler to fight a child by the third attempt? Yet Tiangu and the others did just that! And still, it was too late.

The Control King's lineage, which hadn't developed much in a hundred thousand years, didn't frighten the former Empress. She was more worried about Su Yu. Perhaps the Upper Realm folks didn't understand, or maybe they underestimated him due to his previous defeat, but the former Empress wouldn't.

Not just her, everyone from the lower realms wouldn't underestimate Su Yu. Even if Su Yu appeared arrogant, reckless, and impulsive, it was all a facade. He was young but extremely deep and cunning. Every time he acted, except for the initial stages, he was always tenaciously confident, even ensuring that his side wouldn't fail or suffer casualties before making a move.

Otherwise, he was like a hidden viper, ready to strike at any moment, and if he missed, he would quickly retreat. Su Yu's ascension today only meant one thing: he was confident!

Regarding Su Yu, the former Empress didn't mind using the greatest possibility to speculate about him.

At this moment, the former Empress's words made people feel that she was overestimating Su Yu. Dragon Heavenly Sovereign, on the side, disagreed, "They are strong, but they are only a few. Ants can bite an elephant to death. Just the number of our Daofuse experts is enough to surround and kill them!"

The former Empress glanced at him and transmitted to Moon Heavenly Sovereign, "Stay away from him! This person is not bright and will die sooner or later! The three major clans should not underestimate Su Yu. As for the other races, if they want to court death, let them try!"

"I am the God Emperor's consort, guarding the God Race for a hundred thousand years. I don't wish for the God Race to perish... I am willing to give my last drop of blood to lay the foundation for the God Race for eternity. However, I don't want... my God Race to perish at the hands of fools! Sun Corona and you are both smart people. I hope this won't happen!"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign's heart was solemn as he transmitted, "Empress, do you think Su Yu is comparable to Hundred Battle?"

"Hundred Battle is not a fool... Of course, I don't know much about Hundred Battle's side. Hundred Battle might have his own calculations, but Hundred Battle... it's hard to say. His heart for protecting the Human Race isn't particularly strong... Su Yu, if compared, might be somewhat similar to the Human Emperor of old!"

This was the highest praise!

Moon Heavenly Sovereign became even more serious.

The former Empress continued, "It's actually quite simple! Are March and Giant Axe complete idiots? If not, why would they follow Su Yu without hesitation? How old is Su Yu? How many who have cultivated to the Heavenly Sovereign realm are idiots? Especially March, who is actually very smart and shrewd. The Iron Devourer Race has survived for many years without taking a clear stance since the first tide... Now, they are clearly standing with Su Yu. What do you think?"

Moon Heavenly Sovereign became even more solemn, transmitting, "According to the Empress, perhaps... we should deal with Su Yu first?"

"No!" The former Empress transmitted, "Deal with the Control King's lineage first. Su Yu isn't even dealing with us yet; he's targeting the Control King's lineage first. This means that lineage might be more dangerous at the moment! As for Su Yu's side... I don't recommend directly confronting him. Instead, delay!"

"Delay?" Moon Heavenly Sovereign was surprised. What did she mean?

"Delay until the former Emperor returns..." The former Empress transmitted, "It's soon. I've already felt it. The power of the Great Dao is fluctuating and rejoicing. They're coming back soon!"

The former Empress murmured, continuing to transmit, "Delay! In this era, Su Yu is actually difficult to deal with. Delay until the seal is broken, delay until the former Emperor returns. That's the opportunity to deal with Su Yu!"

"If we can't delay, then defend! If we can't defend... we can even contact Hundred Battle first, to resist Su Yu, let Hundred Battle stand at the forefront..."

"Fighting the Control King's lineage can also be delayed!"

The former Empress quickly transmitted, "Fight, we must fight, but we must delay!"

Regarding the former Empress's words, Moon Heavenly Sovereign was momentarily unsure of how to decide. What kind of talk was this? Fearful, yet not daring to fight, and Su Yu's side, the former Empress actually said, was even more troublesome than the Control King's lineage. There was even a hint of fear!

The former imperial consort was no weakling; she was once a master of the power of laws. Could it be that even a master of laws feared Su Yu? Moon Heavenly Sovereign pondered this, and for the first time, he began to take Su Yu seriously. Was he truly that difficult to deal with? Their interactions with Su Yu had been limited, and the last time they encountered him, Su Yu had been defeated, leaving an impression of recklessness and impulsiveness.

Meanwhile, the atmosphere among the Immortals was much more somber. Tiangu remained silent as he led his people toward Ren Mountain. Behind him, Dao and Desolate Heavenly Sovereigns frowned slightly but said nothing, following along. Immortal Battle Marquis, who had come to greet Tiangu, noticed the heavy atmosphere and attempted to change the subject. "My Emperor, the weapon I threw down last time... did Your Majesty not bring it up?"

"It's with Su Yu!" Tiangu replied without hesitation, even though he was unaware of the situation. He calmly added, "I haven't communicated with you. If there was any communication, it was Su Yu's doing!"

Immortal Battle Marquis was taken aback. "But... I was with the Fate Clan and him..."

"The lower realm's Fate Clan has likely allied with him. As for the upper realm, just don't place too much trust in Fate," Tiangu said as he walked. "Desolate, is Saint Marquis available?"

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign's eyes flickered, and he replied in a low voice, "He's in seclusion!"

"Have him come out!" Tiangu said calmly. "Inform Saint Marquis that it's time to come out. The moment of life and death is upon us!"

Desolate Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly. "Tiangu..."

Tiangu turned his head to look at him and, after a long pause, said, "I don't want to seize your authority, but you know nothing about Su Yu. If I don't take control, you will all eventually die at his hands!"

Tiangu's voice was cold. "Inform Saint Marquis to come out! I want to take charge of the Immortals! If you and Dao find this unacceptable, feel free to challenge me!"

Authority? Tiangu cared deeply about it, yet at the same time, he didn't. But he had to seize control! It wasn't for the sake of power alone but to prevent the Immortals from falling into a desperate situation. These people knew nothing about Su Yu and would never understand his terrifying nature! They would only underestimate him!

If their opponent were merely the Control King's lineage, he wouldn't bother seizing control now. There was no need. He wasn't strong enough, having only reached the Heavenly King domain. Why turn against the two Heavenly Sovereigns? But now, even if it meant turning against them, he had to seize control!

The two Heavenly Sovereigns didn't look pleased, but Tiangu ignored them entirely. Moving swiftly, he soon reached Ren Mountain. Ahead, Immortal Battle Marquis cleared the way for him, quickly activating the restrictions of Ren Mountain. Tiangu stepped directly into Ren Mountain and flew rapidly toward the Immortal territory.

Ahead, Origin Saint Marquis also arrived with his people. Seeing Tiangu, he wore a forced smile but remained polite. "Tiangu has ascended. I was just about to prepare a welcome for you..."

Origin Saint Marquis, like Tiangu, was on the path of the Immortal Emperor! Previously, many who followed this path either died or switched paths, but Origin Saint Marquis had always remained on it. He and Tiangu were connected, perhaps even as fellow disciples!

Tiangu and Origin Saint Marquis both hailed from the Immortal Emperor's lineage, sharing the same master. Thus, they both primarily cultivated the Immortal Emperor's path, though Origin Saint Marquis was older. Tiangu was a figure from the late ancient times.

"No need!" Tiangu brushed past him, leaving Origin Saint Marquis with a somewhat unpleasant expression. Tiangu didn't look at him and headed straight for the Immortal territory.

Upon reaching the Immortal territory, Tiangu wasted no time. His aura surged, and he shouted, "Saint Marquis, I have arrived!"

As his voice fell, a small mountain within the new Immortal territory suddenly split open. In the next moment, an ancient figure appeared, tearing through the void in an instant to stand before Tiangu, eyes filled with joy and excitement.

"Your Highness..."

Tiangu raised his hand, his eyes also filled with excitement. "Saint Marquis, I have arrived!"

"Your Highness!" The elderly man was visibly moved. "Your Highness should have ascended long ago. It's difficult to advance in the lower realm..."

"No!" Tiangu shook his head. "The upper realm isn't necessarily better. The Great Dao is hollow, and the same combat strength is still inferior to that of the lower realm!"

He quickly continued, "Let's not talk about this. Now that I'm here, it can only be this way! Convene the Immortal Council and summon all Daofuse experts. I want to take charge of the Immortals!"

"As you command!" Saint Marquis, with a powerful aura, immediately suspended a seal in the air and declared, "Immortals, convene the Immortal Council. All Daofuse experts, whether in seclusion or away, must come to the council hall immediately!"

"Saint Marquis!" At this moment, Dao Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly and was about to speak when Saint Marquis sternly asked, "Dao, do you have any objections?"

His aura was so overwhelming that it suppressed the two Heavenly Sovereigns, causing them to feel pressured. Meanwhile, the strong figures of the Immortal Battle faction also unleashed their auras, intimidating Origin Saint Marquis and his people!

Tiangu remained calm. Since he had arrived and Saint Marquis was still present, the heavens would not fall! Did Origin Saint want to compete with him? He was far from qualified! Even with the two Heavenly Sovereigns, it wouldn't work.

At this moment, everyone was shocked. Moments later, the long-sealed council hall of the Immortals opened.

Inside the hall, a group of powerful figures quickly gathered. At this moment, the full foundation of the Immortals was revealed. Only now did the outside world see and understand the true strength of the Immortals.

In the vast hall, the once-empty thrones quickly filled with people.

Three Heavenly Sovereigns! Six Heavenly Kings! Below the Heavenly Kings, there were a total of 65 Daofuse experts. Among the Immortals, there were 74 top-tier experts, and this was after Su Yu had killed quite a few, including several pseudo-path Heavenly Kings. Otherwise, the Immortals would have had even more strong figures.

With 74 top-tier experts, the three Heavenly Sovereigns and Tiangu sat side by side, while Origin Saint Marquis and Immortal Battle Marquis were slightly lower, representing their different statuses.

Origin Saint Marquis remained expressionless, lost in thought. Tiangu, looking at the people below, spoke calmly and without reservation, "I don't care if you are willing or not. From today onward, only my orders will be the orders of the Immortals! No one else is allowed to issue any commands to mobilize Daofuse experts!"

As soon as he finished speaking, someone frowned. Below, a Heavenly King said in a deep voice, "Tiangu, this isn't the lower realm!"

Tiangu looked at him coldly. "The upper realm is the same!"

"Tiangu, you..." The Heavenly King was dissatisfied. "Aren't you being too overbearing? Do you understand the upper realm? You just arrived, and you want to do this? Did you do well in the lower realm? You were beaten into sealing your realm and waiting for aid!"

He wasn't sure how Tiangu had the confidence to seize power upon arrival, given his performance in the lower realm. In the lower realm, he had been beaten by a newcomer into sealing his realm and waiting for aid.

The Heavenly King continued, "The upper realm is different. Over the years, under the leadership of the Heavenly Sovereigns and Origin Saint, our strength has grown, and our development has surpassed that of other races. I think, Tiangu, since you're new here, you should wait and see..."

"Impudent!" Immortal Battle Marquis shouted angrily. "Insolent! How dare a newly promoted quasi-king speak so arrogantly here?"

The newly promoted Heavenly King looked at Immortal Battle Marquis with a grim expression, but Immortal Battle Marquis coldly said, "What are you looking at? In the past, you would have been charged with great disrespect! His Majesty, after the disappearance of the Immortal Emperor, was publicly elected to take charge of the Immortals. For ten thousand years, the Immortals have thrived, all thanks to His Majesty! Which tide wasn't won by His Majesty awakening from slumber and leading us to victory?"

"What, are you dissatisfied?" Immortal Battle Marquis coldly said, "If you're dissatisfied, keep it to yourself! His Majesty has been in the lower realm, but now that he's here, the upper realm is His Majesty's domain!"

No one dared to speak. Above, Saint Marquis observed the situation and smiled faintly. "Since no one has any objections, let's proceed according to His Highness's words. Until the Immortal Emperor returns, the Immortals will be under His Highness's command..."

Dao Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly. "I think Tiangu might not be familiar with the upper realm. Perhaps he should follow Origin Saint for a while to learn..."

Saint Marquis replied indifferently, "No need. The upper realm is a small place. What's there to learn? Who here doesn't know His Highness? Since that's the case, the transition will be easy. Origin Saint, complete the transition with His Highness within three days!"

Origin Saint Marquis's expression changed, but he quickly replied softly, "As you command."

Tiangu glanced at him. He knew his senior brother might not submit to him. In the past, they had disagreements over the Immortal Emperor's path. At this moment, he didn't want to create discord with these people! Discord would only weaken the Immortals' strength.

However, his thoughts might not align with theirs.

"Origin Saint, come here!" Tiangu called out softly, causing everyone to frown. Was he looking for trouble already? Wasn't this too fast? Tiangu was never this impatient. Why was he so eager this time?

Origin Saint Marquis's eyes flickered. Was he looking for trouble already? Tiangu's ascent this time was indeed different from before! Origin Saint Marquis cursed inwardly. Was Tiangu acting recklessly because of Saint Marquis's support?

Over the years, even if he hadn't achieved great merit, he had worked hard. During the seclusion of Dao and Desolate Heavenly Sovereigns, he had been in charge of the Immortals. Did Tiangu dare to act against him now?

Countless thoughts raced through his mind as he stepped forward, wanting to see if Tiangu dared to kill him in public! Would he dare?

At this moment, Dao Heavenly Sovereign and others also looked serious. They glanced at Saint Marquis, who remained cold and indifferent, leaving them helpless. Saint Marquis was the foundation of the Immortals, a powerhouse at the level of the Sun Corona, or perhaps even stronger.

With Tiangu's ascent and Saint Marquis's immediate support, along with Immortal Battle and others, unless they wanted the Immortals to split, they had no choice but to comply with Tiangu's will to take charge of the Immortals once more!

Origin Saint Marquis stepped forward, soon standing on the steps below Tiangu. The two were less than a meter apart, staring at each other. Origin Saint Marquis's eyes showed defiance. Would Tiangu dare to kill him?

They were both disciples of the Immortal Emperor! Origin Saint Marquis was even older than Tiangu, his senior brother!

He was unconvinced. In the past, he might have let it go, but now, Tiangu had been stuck in the lower realm for years, his strength stagnant, while he himself had stepped into the Heavenly King realm long ago. Even though Tiangu had recently advanced, it was only a fresh breakthrough.

Their status was similar, yet he was slightly stronger than Tiangu. Why, then, was the Immortal Clan under Tiangu's control and not his? In previous times, it might have been understandable, but during this tide, Tiangu had performed poorly. The Immortal Clan had achieved nothing in the lower realm and had been beaten by the humans there, losing face.

What right did Tiangu have to seize power upon his return? With a rebellious spirit, he glared at Tiangu.

Tiangu, however, remained calm, looking at him. "You are my senior brother. I know you've never accepted me."

Yuan Sheng remained silent. It's good that you know.

"In the past, I was too arrogant, too domineering..."

Yuan Sheng was slightly taken aback. Tiangu continued calmly, "I haven't done everything perfectly over the years, but my heart to protect the Immortal Clan has never changed. I believe you feel the same. We are both disciples of the Immortal Emperor. When he left in haste, he didn't choose anyone to lead the Immortal Clan. But as his disciples, we must safeguard the Immortal Clan for him."

"My return to the upper realm is not for power. Such things are meaningless. Fame and fortune might have been important to me in the past, but now, I see through them."

"Without the Immortal Clan, we are nothing. Now, I only hope for the Immortal Clan to continue."

"The Immortal Emperor might soon return... He is still alive."

Tiangu looked at Yuan Sheng, who showed a hint of mockery in his eyes. "Is my junior brother trying to appeal to our relationship?"

"No need."

Tiangu replied indifferently, "There isn't much of a relationship between us. Years ago, I asked you to sever your path, and you refused. We've harbored resentment since then. I'm merely saying that now is not the time to dwell on such grievances."

Yuan Sheng laughed. How ridiculous! You think a simple statement can resolve everything?

Tiangu remained calm. "How about we settle our grievances today?"

"Hmm?"

Yuan Sheng was slightly surprised. Tiangu said coldly, "We both cultivate the Immortal Emperor's Great Dao and have reached the Heavenly King level. Let's compete in the Great Dao today and settle this once and for all. This way, you won't trouble me anymore."

"What do you mean?"

"A Great Dao duel!"

Tiangu said coldly, "We will devour each other's power of laws. The winner becomes a Heavenly Sovereign, and the loser severs their path. Two Heavenly Kings for one Heavenly Sovereign—it's a fair trade."

"No!"

At this moment, three Heavenly Sovereigns spoke up to stop them. This was unacceptable. Losing one's path was not a trivial matter.

Tiangu ignored them, looking at Yuan Sheng with indifference. "Do you want to try?"

Yuan Sheng's expression was heavy as he looked at Tiangu, coldly saying, "You think you have me cornered?"

"No."

Tiangu replied calmly, "It's about understanding the Great Dao. I just advanced and might not be as good as you."

Yuan Sheng, however, lacked confidence. His talent indeed wasn't as good as Tiangu's, and his comprehension of the Great Dao might not match Tiangu's either. But Tiangu had been in the lower realm, and the Heavenly Kings there were generally stronger than those in the upper realm.

Today, Tiangu had come to challenge him to a Great Dao duel, to devour each other's power!

Clearly, this guy wanted to use his strength to become a Heavenly Sovereign!

Yuan Sheng's eyes flickered. Would he lose? Most likely! But... he was unwilling!

The Dao and Desolate Heavenly Sovereigns seemed to think so too. The Dao Heavenly Sovereign frowned slightly. "Tiangu, this isn't appropriate. We are all on the same side. Yuan Sheng is still your senior brother. How can you do this..."

Clearly, he thought Yuan Sheng would lose!

Yuan Sheng's mind was in turmoil. Finally, he laughed, gritting his teeth. "Fine! Let's compete! I refuse to believe I'll lose to you my entire life! Tiangu, I've never accepted you, and that's how it is! Fine, let's settle this today... If I lose and you become a Heavenly Sovereign... fine, at least people won't say that the Immortal Emperor's disciples couldn't produce a single Heavenly Sovereign!"

Come on! I refuse to accept you. Why should you occupy the throne? Just because you have talent? Then let's only consider talent in the future!

If I lose, I'll step down and hand the Immortal Clan to you. Fine, if you become a Heavenly Sovereign, you'll have better control over the Immortal Clan.

Yuan Sheng's power of laws manifested, coldly looking at Tiangu. His power was somewhat unstable, as was common among upper realm experts.

Tiangu's power of laws also manifested, weaker but more refined. This was the result of years of accumulation and foundation.

One was a steel pillar, the other a wooden stick. Which was stronger?

At this moment, everyone had a sense of the outcome. Most likely, Yuan Sheng would not be able to defeat Tiangu!

The crowd had mixed feelings. Even if Tiangu won, over the years, it was Yuan Sheng who had led them to where they were today, not Tiangu. Why go to such lengths when you've already been acknowledged as the leader?

Tiangu's power of laws manifested. Regardless of what others thought, the next moment, the two powers collided, instantly merging into a stronger power of laws!

In an instant, both their auras vaguely reached the level of a Heavenly Sovereign. Of course, this was in a combined state.

At this moment, everyone watched silently. Devouring the Great Dao was extremely dangerous. Everyone vaguely saw Tiangu's power of laws quickly suppressing Yuan Sheng!

Yuan Sheng struggled violently, but his Great Dao was unstable and clearly at a disadvantage.

In a real fight, the outcome was uncertain! But in a Great Dao duel, it was all about comprehension.

Yuan Sheng was losing!

"Roar!"

Yuan Sheng roared fiercely, his Great Dao struggling, but it was firmly suppressed by Tiangu.

At this moment, Yuan Sheng was in despair, feeling defeated, somewhat unwilling, yet somewhat relieved... I... am truly not as good as him!

Everyone said Tiangu was a genius, but no one said Yuan Sheng was a genius. Indeed, even at the same level, I am still not as good as him!

Yuan Sheng mocked himself, smiling inwardly. Enough!

Two tigers cannot share one mountain! Perhaps I should really step down. Fine!

And at this moment, Tiangu, who had suppressed his Great Dao, suddenly sent waves of comprehension and power of laws into Yuan Sheng's Great Dao!

Others hadn't noticed yet, but Yuan Sheng, initially in despair, suddenly froze.

Tiangu... made a mistake?

It's supposed to be devouring, not giving! Why are you transmitting your comprehension and power of laws to me?

This fool, did he get it wrong? Impossible!

Yuan Sheng found it unbelievable. Who could be so foolish?

He was about to say something when Tiangu's voice echoed in his mind, cold and disdainful, "Comprehend and cultivate, or you'll never become a Heavenly Sovereign! You fool, the master took away the strong and talented ones. I was left behind because I was young. You were left because you were weak and foolish!"

"......"

Yuan Sheng was shocked, wanting to curse, but he couldn't speak. His power of laws was suppressed!

"Hurry up, you waste!"

Tiangu transmitted, "I only hope that when you become a Heavenly Sovereign, you won't be the weakest one! Don't disgrace the Immortal Emperor's Great Dao!"

"What about you?"

Yuan Sheng's will wavered, incredulous. What about you?

"Xianzhan seized the physical path from the pseudo-dao. I'll borrow it for now. The physical path is a foundational Great Dao. I can quickly become a Heavenly King or even a Heavenly Sovereign! This path isn't weak, though it seems to be under Su Yu's control... No matter, I'll change paths eventually! The Immortal Emperor's Great Dao can't become the master of rules, so it's just right for you, fool!"

"Just right, to add another Heavenly Sovereign to our Immortal Clan!"

Under Yuan Sheng's astonished gaze, before others could see clearly, Tiangu suddenly grunted, severing his power of laws, merging all his comprehension into Yuan Sheng's Great Dao!

The next moment, he reached out, and Xianzhan, with a hint of sadness, handed over a power of laws!

Tiangu quickly fused it, and in the blink of an eye, his aura reached the Daofuse level!

The physical path! This was the power of laws Xianzhan and Blood Severance Marquis had fought over. Even Xianzhan, a Heavenly King, wanted to change paths, and Blood Severance wanted it too. But later, when trouble arose with the pseudo-dao, Xianzhan had to give up!

Now, Tiangu had taken it!

In the blink of an eye, Tiangu's aura soared, while beside him, Yuan Sheng's aura also surged, advancing toward the Heavenly Sovereign level!

Only at this moment did others sense something, incredulous. Someone whispered, "Yuan Sheng... won?"

At this moment, the Holy Marquis frowned slightly, and Xianzhan Marquis gritted his teeth, angrily saying, "What do you mean won? His Majesty willingly gave up his power of laws. Otherwise, how could Yuan Sheng win?"

Everyone was stunned! Why?

Tiangu quickly fused the physical pseudo-dao. Moments later, his aura stabilized somewhat, vaguely possessing the power of a second-tier Daofuse. These experts were familiar with the physical path. Precisely because changing paths could quickly enhance one's strength, they chose to change.

Perhaps it wouldn't be long before Tiangu became a Heavenly King of the physical path.

At this moment, Tiangu suddenly opened his eyes, saying indifferently, "Yuan Sheng has become a Heavenly Sovereign. My combat strength won't be affected, equivalent to our clan gaining another Heavenly Sovereign! Now, the survival of the Immortal Clan is at stake. It's not as simple as you think! The real threat of extinction comes from Su Yu, not the Control King's lineage! Believe it or not, this is my governing strategy moving forward!"

"Guard against Su Yu. Be cautious in all matters related to him. Think thrice before acting!"

Boom!

A burst of energy erupted as Yuan Sheng's aura instantly strengthened to the level of a Heavenly Sovereign. Opening his eyes, he looked at Tiangu with a complex expression. "You..."

Tiangu said coldly, "I don't need your gratitude. It's too cheap! From now on, don't oppose me. Obedience is the best outcome! The Immortal Emperor's Great Dao isn't omnipotent. It's more about understanding life! This path can't break through to become the master of rules. That might be the price! Of course, discussing this now is premature!"

Yuan Sheng was speechless. After a long time, he bowed, saying, "Yuan Sheng... understands! I will follow His Majesty's orders!"

At this moment, he chose to submit.

Because Tiangu was not quite what he had imagined.

At this moment, although Tiangu's strength had declined, the three Heavenly Sovereigns all nodded slightly. 

Below, the sound of submission quickly rose.

"We obey His Majesty's command!"

The voice resounded through the Immortal Race!

On his first day in the Upper Realm, Tiangu instantly took control of the entire Immortal Race.
