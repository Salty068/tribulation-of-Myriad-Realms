Chapter 851: The Scheming Su Yu

The Human Emperor felt a complex mix of emotions.

Meanwhile, within the Myriad Realms, Su Yu exhaled softly. "I've done what I could, what I should. I've made the decision for you. Whether you choose to live or die is up to you."

Su Yu didn't envy the Human Emperor, but he did respect him. As long as Su Yu was human, he had to respect him to some degree. To cultivate to the level of the Human Emperor, where the Great Dao was centered on humanity and responsibility, was something Su Yu found incredibly admirable. Of course, he was also wary, wary that this madman might integrate his Dao into Su Yu's own Heaven. Su Yu had no desire for that.

Now, having successfully compressed the Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth, Su Yu sat cross-legged, floating within his own Heaven and Earth. He needed to digest his recent gains.

Previously, he had slain several rulers of laws, and the power of their Great Daos had collapsed, merging into Su Yu's Heaven and Earth. The Great Zhou King, the Nether Emperor, and even the Human Emperor's physical body had contributed to this. He had also extracted a significant amount of power from the Human Emperor's Heaven and Earth. Moreover, the Martial Emperor had integrated his Dao into Su Yu's realm.

In short, Su Yu had reaped enormous rewards recently, but he hadn't had much time to digest them. There was even a first-class realm expert, still alive, who had been nurturing his Heaven and Earth with all his might—a truly good person!

Taking advantage of this moment in the Myriad Realms, Su Yu began to absorb and digest these gains. Sharpening the axe does not delay the work of chopping wood!

Other matters could wait.

His Heaven and Earth continued to expand.

Everyone within his Heaven and Earth emerged, and they saw Su Yu. They weren't surprised by his sudden return. Su Yu was always so efficient; he must have won another victory at the front lines. And Su Yu, being young, was destined never to idle, nor did he wish to.

From the day he entered the academy, Su Yu had never stopped. He had always been fighting, fighting, and fighting again. Su Yu was truly a powerhouse who had risen from countless battles.

Now that Su Yu had returned, everyone knew it was only to better prepare for the next confrontation with the enemy. So, no one dared to disturb him, even though they had much to say to him, like the gossip about the Great Zhou King and Lantian's entanglements.

...

At this moment, Su Yu was unaware of such gossip; otherwise, he might have taken some time to listen.

He focused on absorbing and digesting his previous gains.

In his Heaven and Earth, one Dao after another was being strengthened. Many rulers of laws had died, and their Daos and corpses had been devoured by Su Yu's Heaven and Earth. Now, one Dao after another grew stronger, and before Su Yu, a book appeared.

The Mark of Civilization!

Of course, it no longer had a cover, as he had returned it to the Human Emperor. Su Yu was like that: you respect me a foot, I respect you a yard. When he was weak, the Dao Chart had helped him greatly. Now, the Human Emperor needed it, so Su Yu didn't hesitate to return it.

Without the book cover, Su Yu didn't mind. He had another treasure to serve as the cover—the cover of the Book of Time!

The entire Book of Time had been integrated into Su Yu, but the cover remained, inscribed with the words "Recipe." This was also a powerful treasure. Since the Time Sage was still behind the Heaven Gate and couldn't use it, Su Yu could borrow it for now.

The "Recipe" cover instantly merged into Su Yu's Mark of Civilization.

The four large characters "Universal Civilization" reappeared, overshadowing the "Recipe" characters.

The Mark of Civilization flipped page by page, growing stronger with each turn.

As he turned a page, words and illustrations appeared, such as the page on the Dao of the Physical Body, which now displayed the image of the Martial Emperor. This was also Su Yu's way of managing the distribution of Daos within his Heaven and Earth.

The Dao of the Physical Body was now occupied by the Martial Emperor. Previously, there had been no ruler of laws for the Dao of the Physical Body among the human race. Now, with the Martial Emperor's stewardship, the Dao of the Physical Body reached the second tier, and other cultivators of the Dao of the Physical Body grew stronger.

Su Yu continued flipping through the tome, noting the vast differences in strength within the book.

The strong had reached the second tier.

The weak, some Daos, only possessed eternal power, not even reaching the Daofuse level.

"The disparity in the power of the Daos is too great!"

Su Yu murmured as he flipped through the pages. Ideally, all Daos would be balanced. If the three thousand Daos he controlled all reached the second tier, Su Yu would be unimaginably powerful. He couldn't even fathom how strong he would be in total.

Not to mention the second tier, if all Daos reached the level of a ruler of laws... Su Yu might far surpass the Master of the Undead.

"Difficult!"

Su Yu shook his head slightly after a while.

Currently, his Heaven and Earth could only sustain the existence of over thirty rulers of laws, unlike the River of Time, which sustained countless rulers of laws. That was truly terrifyingly powerful.

While Su Yu was absorbing and digesting, a slight fluctuation of power occurred in a certain part of his Heaven and Earth.

At this moment, Su Yu focused his gaze and revealed a faint smile.

There, at the starting point of the power he had integrated, was where Gui was making some small moves, trying to enter the Myriad Realms. Of course, it was still too early, but Gui maintained full power, continuously infiltrating with his strength. Eventually, he could descend in person.

With a wave of his hand, Su Yu altered that part of Heaven and Earth. Vaguely, it seemed to transform into the Myriad Realms, with a small Sea of Stars floating, myriad realms standing tall, and faint shadows of living beings appearing.

Creating illusions and fabricating the Myriad Realms within his own Heaven and Earth was too easy.

Even if Gui tried to spy, he couldn't see much or penetrate much of Su Yu's will.

...

Meanwhile, behind the Heaven Gate.

Gui was panting, exhausted but exhilarated.

He had been maintaining full power, infiltrating the Myriad Realms with his strength. It was tiring but exhilarating. At this moment, he could vaguely sense that his power had imprinted on the Myriad Realms!

In the next moment, his eyes seemed to reveal a world.

Through the Heaven Gate, he wanted to glimpse the Myriad Realms!

At this moment, the Sea of Stars appeared in his eyes.

"The Myriad Realms!"

Gui's eyes flickered with excitement as the image of the Myriad Realms seemed to unfold before him. "It's really imprinted... but not enough yet!"

It was only an imprint, shallow and insufficient to support his full descent into the Myriad Realms. As for descending with his will, it was meaningless. He wanted to fully enter the Myriad Realms and seize the initiative!

As a 16-path powerhouse, he wasn't weak behind the Heaven Gate, but to be considered top-tier... he needed to eliminate beings like the Master of the Undead first.

Gui had no such intentions!

His only thought now was that he had struck it rich. This Su Yu was too arrogant, allowing his power to infiltrate the Myriad Realms. This was probably the most audacious Heaven Gate opener in history!

Who wouldn't want to return to the Myriad Realms?

Returning to the Myriad Realms to become the one and only!

"There seems to be a 15-path powerhouse in the Myriad Realms now, which is Su Yu's opponent... This guy has created an opportunity for himself, but he might also become an obstacle!"

"And then there's Xingyu and his group. They all went to the upper reaches of the River of Time back then. Who knows when they'll return... I need to hurry!"

One thought after another echoed in Gui's mind.

Compared to the powerful figure connected by the sixth generation Human Lord, Gui was much luckier. That figure had infiltrated for years, yet hadn't even penetrated a tenth of his power, unable to descend in person, only able to descend with his will.

In contrast, Gui, despite the high cost, had left an imprint on the Myriad Realms in a short time, which was exhilarating.

"There is currently a 15-path powerhouse in the Myriad Realms. Besides that, with Xingyu's seal broken, many rulers of laws might have emerged. Su Yu alone might not be able to match them, and since they haven't killed Su Yu, it means Su Yu's side also has rulers of laws..."

He kept analyzing, considering whether to recruit some allies.

If he imprinted on the Myriad Realms and descended in person, others could also infiltrate with their power. Even if they couldn't descend in person, descending with their will would be enough to display formidable strength.

But should he recruit others?

Upon entering the Myriad Realms, the first priority was to seize control, then proceed gradually. After all, there were still some powerful figures upstream, and even Gui was extremely wary of beings like Xingyu.

He hadn't met the Human Emperor, but he knew how strong the Culture King was!

If not for getting entangled with that figure upon arrival, the Culture King would have been a supreme existence behind the Heaven Gate.

"But if I want to recruit allies... I still need Su Yu's side to lend a hand, to leave an imprint in the Myriad Realms!"

"Su Yu isn't foolish. If I make such a request, will he be concerned?"

Gui pondered. Su Yu was a ruler, not someone easily fooled.

After thinking for a while, Gui decided to give it a try, as he urgently needed an opportunity. Not just him, many people now urgently needed an opportunity to enter the Myriad Realms ahead of time.

Just like the other side of the Gate of Hell, some ancient beasts also desperately hoped to enter the Myriad Realms ahead of time, rather than wait.

Because the strong were behind.

Once they entered the Myriad Realms alongside the strong, the opportunities would be too few. But if they entered alone ahead of time, they would be top-tier existences in the Myriad Realms. Even if it was only for a few years, it would be enough for them to seize opportunities they couldn't otherwise.

Opportunities must not be missed!

At this moment, Gui made his decision.

...

"Su Yu!"

While Su Yu was still cultivating, he suddenly opened his eyes. In the next moment, his will flickered, and he appeared beside the Heaven Gate's shadow, his figure towering, wearing a crown, and draped in a golden robe, exuding an overwhelming aura.

"What is it?"

Su Yu's voice was cold. "Don't tell me you can't hold on! My adversary has been searching for me everywhere these days. If you can't do it, say so early, or you'll harm both me and yourself! These days, your power has been infiltrating the Myriad Realms, leaving some imprints. I haven't stopped you, so you have enough motivation to help me. If you fail... you're useless, and I'll find a way to dispel the imprints you've left!"

Gui's heart trembled. This person... truly wasn't easy to deal with!

The voice carried a hint of amusement, "Su Yu, you and I are now friends helping each other... There's no need for such formality! I'm assisting you, and you're assisting me. That's the best kind of cooperation! However... I am indeed struggling to maintain this. The main issue is the Heaven Gate's isolation, which has consumed too much energy, leaving me with less than a tenth of my power to transmit."

"What do you want?"

Su Yu replied calmly, "Just say it directly. If I find it acceptable, I'll agree. There's no need to try and seduce or tempt me. If I couldn't discern such things, I would have been killed long ago!"

Gui felt a bit helpless. This guy was really difficult to deal with!

After a moment of thought, he said, "It's like this. I have some matters to handle on my side. After the Heaven Gate, many things are happening, and I must resolve them... So, I can retain half of my power to maintain your current state..."

Su Yu frowned, "Nonsense, if you leave half of your power, I'll fall from the initial second tier to the third tier. How am I supposed to fight that bastard? Can a third-tier fight a second-tier peak? If that's the case, you can leave on your own. I'll disperse all your power and sever all connections! The Heaven Gate's shadow is mine. If I don't summon it, you can't infiltrate your power!"

As the opener of the Heaven Gate, I have this level of authority. If I don't allow you to infiltrate, you can't.

Otherwise, wouldn't any Heaven Gate opener have been forcibly infiltrated long ago?

Gui clearly understood this logic as well.

Of course, he was just making excuses. Seeing Su Yu's refusal, he quickly said, "But I really have urgent matters to handle... How about this, I have some subordinates here. I can let them borrow some power..."

Su Yu frowned, "Subordinates? Are you planning to let your subordinates descend into the Myriad Realms too? Forget it, I don't care, but if you call too many people, the power will be impure and chaotic, completely different from pure physical strength!"

Gui was slightly taken aback!

Damn!

Su Yu didn't care about subordinates or not; his only concern was whether the power was pure!

This was unexpected!

He thought he would have to haggle with Su Yu over this, and that Su Yu would even sternly refuse!

But... no!

Su Yu's only concern was whether the power was pure enough. After all, he had previously received physical power, and if what infiltrated was something else...

This made Gui hesitate.

Are you really unaware, or do you just not care?

And Su Yu, as if knowing what he was thinking, sneered, "Aren't the people from the Heaven Gate just trying to get out? The Heaven Gate might open soon, and you people are probably the weaker ones trying to get out early. Do you really think I don't understand? To me... does it matter? As long as you offer enough benefits, what does it matter if you come out? One enemy is an enemy, a group is still an enemy!"

Su Yu was domineering and arrogant, "If you really come out and I can't match you, I'll go upstream to find the Human Emperor. Can you match the Human Emperor? The premise is, I need enough benefits! Without benefits, don't even think about it!"

Gui was a bit stunned. This Su Yu... was interesting!

He seemed to have guessed many things.

But he didn't care about these; he cared more about the benefits at hand, about improving himself at this critical moment?

Sure enough, Su Yu continued, "I know, in the coming years, the Myriad Realms might be in chaos. Previously, the Gate of Hell was in turmoil, and ancient beasts emerged. I even killed a ruler of laws... The situation is getting more and more tense! All sorts of monsters are coming out. My rival even controls the Human Gate, seemingly related to it, perhaps its representative! At this moment, I need enough help from the Heaven Gate..."

Gui was once again surprised, "Your opponent opened the Human Gate?"

"Yes!"

This time, Gui had some understanding, "No wonder! They actually opened the Human Gate... Maybe someone from the Human Gate gave them guidance or support, otherwise, a second-tier... difficult!"

Difficult my ass, not difficult at all, Su Yu thought to himself.

He realized that Gui might be even more anxious than he was.

Su Yu was eager to rush in, while Gui was eager to get out sooner, not even satisfied with coming out alone, worried about not being able to take down the Myriad Realms, encountering trouble, and thus looking for help?

Su Yu almost laughed!

Good news!

Is this because you think nurturing my world alone isn't enough, and you want to find more?

Su Yu thought to himself, but his tone remained cold, "I don't care about these things. Now that the Three Gates are in chaos, everyone wants to come out. The Control King's lineage even wants to bring out the Control King from the Gate of Hell! The Human Ancestor, Human Emperor, and even strong ones from the Myriad Races want to return... One more of you doesn't make a difference, one less doesn't matter!"

"But, before that, I need to elevate myself enough to participate in the upcoming turmoil!"

Su Yu's voice was indifferent, "I'm not an idiot, nor a fool. I know your intentions very well! Gui, you want to come out early, I have no objection, but I know, your reliance is on me! So, just say directly, how many benefits can you offer, that's the key!"

Gui didn't expect Su Yu to be so straightforward and blunt. After a while, he said, "Benefits... After I come out, I'll protect you..."

"Get lost!"

Su Yu cursed directly, coldly saying, "Do you take me for a three-year-old? Protect me after you come out? Do I need that? What a joke! Entrusting my life to someone like you, that's the real stupidity!"

Gui also had a headache, "But I can't descend into the Myriad Realms now. If you really want benefits, I can only give you some power support, other than that... I don't seem to be able to offer you anything!"

As for guidance or something, Su Yu was already a ruler of laws, not much use.

If Su Yu were weak, only having some eternal Daofuse power, he could offer a lot. The key is Su Yu isn't too weak. If he were weak, he could play the role of a fortuitous encounter grandpa without any problem.

The key is, he can't offer those things now.

Su Yu was indifferent, silent for a moment, then spoke, "No, you can offer something!"

"What do you want?"

Gui asked, and Su Yu said quietly, "Power of the Dao!"

"What?"

Gui was puzzled, what power of the Dao?

Su Yu chuckled quietly, "Various powers of the Dao, power of the myriad Daos, rule fragments, rule insights... Gui, you're not weak! Why don't you go kill some rulers of laws behind the gate, strip their Daos, and send them over..."

At this moment, Gui's heart trembled slightly, suddenly feeling a bit cold.

This guy... is he tempting me?

Who's really in control here!

I'm the strong one, logically, I should be in control of everything, yet this guy is actually urging me to kill and send everything to him. Gui suppressed his unease, speaking in a low voice, "You walk the path of the physical body, these things aren't very useful to you..."

"Idiot, don't I have subordinates?"

Su Yu said coldly, "The Myriad Realms have just been unsealed, some of my subordinates need to be elevated!"

"But the power behind the gate and the power outside the gate are different!"

Gui still explained, "To put it this way, if you divide yin and yang, behind the gate is yin, outside the gate is yang. Even if the Daos are the same, they're different..."

Su Yu said indifferently, "I know, but... does it matter? Besides, don't try to deceive me, yin and yang combined might be even better! Otherwise, why are you people behind the gate all trying to get out?"

Gui fell into contemplation, soon saying, "I can't do that, killing a ruler of laws isn't that simple... Su Yu, you don't understand..."

Boom!

A loud noise, the portal trembled, Su Yu said calmly, "Forget it, you're not honest! I don't refuse your requests, but you refuse mine so readily, hesitating and vague. I don't think much of people like you! Claims of being comparable to the Human Emperor are nonsense! Cooperating with someone like you is pointless, it might even get me killed... So let's end this here, I won't borrow your power anymore, you can continue with your Heaven Gate matters!"

"Su Yu, wait..."

Boom!

Su Yu severed the power of the Dao, a cold voice echoed, "I know where you left your mark, soon, I'll remove it! I am the Human Lord, trying to take advantage of me without paying, do you really think I'm an idiot?"

Boom!

Another loud noise, the portal was locked by Su Yu, instantly severing the connection, Gui's voice quickly echoed, "Su Yu, don't, without my borrowed power, you'll be in trouble... Your opponent is very strong..."

"Idiot, at worst I'll go upstream to find the Human Emperor, the Myriad Realms, it's not like I have to stay here? I just didn't want to look at people's faces before!"

With a bang, everything was blocked!

...

Behind the gate.

Gui was dumbfounded.

This isn't how it was supposed to be!

We were talking nicely, I said I'd bring people, you even agreed, why the hell did you suddenly turn hostile!

He just cut off his power like that!

The Heaven Gate's shadow, after all, belonged to Su Yu. Su Yu held the initiative, if he really wanted to cut it off, now, he did have some imprints outside, and could forcibly descend a bit of willpower.

Maybe he could descend with the power of a fourth-tier ruler of laws?

But that's useless!

What I want is to get my true body out, otherwise, it would be just like the sixth generation Human Lord's time, descending a clone out, completely useless, once the power is exhausted, it's gone.

"This guy..."

Gui was a bit frustrated, a bit helpless.

This guy, a smart person!

Dealing with smart people is too troublesome, the key is, this guy has a bit of a madman's vibe, one moment we're talking nicely, the next moment, just because I hesitated a bit, he cut off the connection!

"He wants to dispel my imprint..."

Gui wanted to curse, I've spent a lot of power, been going all out these days, if you dispel it, wouldn't it all be for nothing?

"He wants the power of the rules behind the gate, the rule Daos and fragments..."

Gui frowned slightly, to elevate his subordinates?

The Division of Yin and Yang... the Unity of Yin and Yang... Su Yu had indeed hit upon some truths.

In reality, Su Yu didn't care. Regardless of what power or what Dao rules, he wanted them all. His universe's Dao encompassed everything, and even if he didn't have something, he could cultivate it as a new page, perfecting his Dao. How wonderful.

The Dao of the Cosmos embraced all directions, encompassed everything. Su Yu didn't care what the other party offered; as long as it was given, he would take it.

Other things couldn't be transmitted, but power could. Since he could borrow power, he could transmit the power of laws.

At this moment, Gui was having a headache. This guy really severed the Heaven Gate without a second thought. The key issue was, he was now worried that without his support, this guy might be killed by his opponent.

The opponent was a powerful being who had opened the Human Gate!

"Are the beings within the Human Gate also plotting?"

"The Earth Gate is also bringing out powerful beings..."

"But the Heaven Gate, there are too few who have opened it; it's difficult to open..."

Gui was pondering, his expression changing. At this moment, he sensed that his imprint seemed to have been discovered by Su Yu, who was dispelling it!

"Madman!"

Gui couldn't help but curse. Does he believe I won't descend with my willpower and kill him right now? You're just a fourth-tier; if I descend, at least I'll be a fourth-tier too. Do you believe I can kill you?

But... descending now would really tear things apart!

Gui was exasperated!

I've been supporting you with all my might for several days, and now I might end up with nothing?

...

In the Myriad Realms.

Su Yu wore a smile. Gui, you provided me with this opportunity yourself. Before, I couldn't tell if you were anxious, but when you mentioned finding someone, I knew you were eager!

Eager to come out!

Eager to solve the troubles of the Myriad Realms!

"People, no matter how anxious, shouldn't show it too clearly, or they'll be caught."

Su Yu chuckled. Once you're caught, you'll be uncomfortable.

Originally, everyone was cooperating equally.

But when Gui showed his eagerness, and Su Yu said he was going upstream to find the Human Emperor, Gui didn't know what Su Yu was thinking. When Su Yu severed the connection, Gui could only become more anxious!

Su Yu slowly erased the imprint left by Gui.

He believed Gui would agree and would come to him.

"This doesn't fit the tropes I've read in books..."

Su Yu murmured with a smile. Why do I feel like such a villain?

Isn't it usually the big shots scheming against the newbies?

Why... did I scheme against Gui, this ancient being, and even tempt him into a murderous deal? I feel like the real villain, while Gui seems like the pitiful one.

"Truly pitiful, insisting on coming to my Heaven Gate. Well, you deserve it!"

At this moment, Gui felt to Su Yu like a pitiful creature about to sell its soul to the devil!

"Do you want to sell your soul and make a deal with me?"

Su Yu murmured to himself, his smile radiant.

He believed it would happen.

Sure enough, just as he was erasing Gui's imprint, suddenly, the Heaven Gate trembled. Su Yu smiled and opened a crack, and Gui's urgent voice came through, "Su Yu, I agree, let's cooperate!"

He was anxious!

Very anxious!

Su Yu, stop erasing it. I've spent several days, and I can descend with fourth-tier power. If you keep erasing, I'll have to start over!

Su Yu continued erasing, speaking calmly, "You're a top-tier expert. Haven't you killed anyone behind the Heaven Gate all these years? If you've killed, don't you have some Dao power left? Send some over, let me see the quality, and whether it can merge with my people!"

"Su Yu, you..."

Boom!

The Heaven Gate closed again, and Su Yu continued erasing.

This time, he didn't even open the Heaven Gate, letting Gui knock on the other side without responding.

After a while, Su Yu was still erasing the imprint. The imprint trembled slightly, and a voice filled with fatigue and helplessness came through, "Su Yu, let's cooperate. I agree. Open the Heaven Gate first..."

Su Yu slapped away that bit of willpower, and soon, the Heaven Gate opened a crack again. Su Yu's voice echoed through, "Have you thought it through?"

"I've thought it through!"

Gui was feeling a bit aggrieved!

He wanted to kill someone!

He was supposed to be the one in control, but suddenly, all the control shifted to Su Yu.

He was about to explode with anger!

But Gui still said, "Su Yu, killing a ruler of laws isn't that simple. Even if you kill them, you might not be able to strip away their Dao power. Over the years, I haven't accumulated much..."

Seeing Su Yu about to close the gate again, he panicked and quickly said, "But I can find someone to trade with, to borrow. Su Yu, don't close the gate again. If you do, it won't benefit you either!"

Su Yu said calmly, "Actually, you can help me with something, and I'll give you time."

"What is it?"

"Go find the Culture King... you don't need to bring him over. I know you're worried about being discovered by him... just go to him and tell him to give me all the benefits he's gained from killing people over the years... just pass them on to me!"

"How is that possible!"

Gui was dumbfounded. You don't even know him, and you want me, an outsider, to ask for it? You think he'll just give it to you?

Are you joking!

Su Yu said calmly, "Just tell him I'm the tenth generation Human Lord, an existence who has opened the Heaven Gate. Oh, and add that the Martial King is an idiot... Hmm, just like that, see if you can get some treasures."

"......"

Gui was about to explode. Stop joking!

The Martial King would kill me!

Yes, he boasted to Su Yu, but he couldn't even match the Martial King, let alone the Culture King. If I really dared to say that, the Martial King would kill me!

"They won't give it, Su Yu..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu said unceremoniously, "Just go and say it. As for how to avoid the Culture King's tracking, or not being discovered where my Heaven Gate is, that's your problem! You're a strong expert. If you can't handle this small matter... and you still want to come out and take the lead? That's a joke! Sooner or later, you'll be beaten to death! As for whether the Culture King gives it or not, that's his business, not yours!"

Will the Culture King give it?

He will!

It's a tacit understanding!

Although Su Yu hadn't interacted much with the Culture King, only having a brief conversation once, he was sure the Culture King would give it.

Su Yu was certain!

The Culture King and Martial King had been in the Heaven Gate for so many years, hadn't they killed anyone?

Su Yu didn't believe it!

As for the Culture King's world, Su Yu thought for a moment and added, "Also, add that he should tell me where he's hiding his lair. Fat Ball wants to eat something delicious but couldn't find it, so he should quickly tell me the address of his lair!"

"......"

Gui's voice carried some reluctance, "Su Yu... I'm not your subordinate, you..."

"Then goodbye!"

Boom!

The Heaven Gate closed, and Su Yu quickly erased his imprint. Gui frantically knocked on the Heaven Gate, and soon, a willpower was transmitted through the imprint again, "I..."

Bang!

Su Yu punched away that bit of willpower!

Moments later, the Heaven Gate opened again, and Gui's voice carried some fatigue, "You're a madman. Why negotiate like this? But I have conditions too!"

"Speak!"

"The matter we discussed earlier, about having my subordinates help..."

"No problem!"

Su Yu agreed readily. Gui continued, "I want some intelligence and information about the Myriad Realms, and it must be accurate!"

"Okay!"

"I... I want to manifest a clone with willpower. Don't worry, it won't be too strong. Even if it's just Sunmoon Realm... but I want to see it with my own eyes."

He was a bit apprehensive. Was this too much?

Su Yu was silent for a moment before saying, "Okay!"

Gui was stunned!

This... is also okay?

Is Su Yu crazy?

You're agreeing to let my clone come?

Of course, Su Yu agreed!

Nonsense, you're descending into my world. I'll create a small world for you, satisfying your curiosity. Want people? I'll give you people. Want items? I'll give you items. Can your weak clone see through it?

I'll create an illusionary world for you!

You can see whatever you want!

Of course, Su Yu also had conditions. He said calmly, "However, your manifested clone must not be too strong. Sunmoon Realm is enough! If it exceeds Sunmoon Realm... I'll erase your clone!"

"Additionally, besides what the Culture King gives, you must also provide me with enough benefits, at least ten complete fourth-tier Dao powers, the more the better. Otherwise... I'll close the Heaven Gate again!"

Su Yu said with a smile, "I'm not asking for much. That's it. If you agree, we'll cooperate. If not, we'll part ways!"

Gui quickly thought it over. It seemed... not bad!

Except for finding the Culture King, which was a bit risky, but as long as he avoided being tracked by the Culture King... he might not have the chance to track me, then there's no problem.

He didn't have ten fourth-tier Dao powers himself, but he could find someone.

For example, the person he planned to cooperate with!

Thinking of this, Gui quickly said, "These are all fine... but I must say in advance, even if I find the Culture King, if he doesn't give... then there's nothing I can do!"

Su Yu said impatiently, "He will give. If he doesn't, it means you embezzled it! It's that simple!"

"But..."

"No buts!"

Su Yu interrupted him!

Gui was almost exploding with anger. You're so sure the Culture King will give?

Do you know the Culture King?

Or are you the Culture King's son?

Damn!

Su Yu's words were somewhat unreasonable!

Gui was speechless. The Culture King, such a powerful figure, had left the Myriad Realms long ago. This young Su Yu clearly didn't know the Culture King. You're not even going yourself, but sending an outsider. Do you think the Culture King will give you anything?

You think the Culture King is an idiot?

The Culture King giving it would be strange!

Gui kept complaining in his heart. Su Yu's request was indeed a bit unreasonable.

"Then I'll try... if I can't get it, then... then you'll have to find a way yourself. I can't possibly fall out with the Culture King now..."

To maintain a bit of dignity, he didn't even dare to say he was afraid of being killed by the Culture King.

Chapter 870: The Search for the Culture King

"Alright, just be quick about it. I'll give you three days. If you don't find the Culture King within that time, I'll close the Heaven Gate and erase all your imprints!"

"Three days is too short!"

Boom!

Su Yu shut the Heaven Gate once more, silencing any further protests. People are often driven to their limits; three days should be enough. If it were one of my subordinates, I'd give them a day at most. You old folks are just too slow!

Behind the gate, Gui let out a deep sigh. Suddenly, he felt that collaborating with Su Yu might not be the safest choice.

"This guy... he's a bit crazy!"

Gui frowned, momentarily at a loss for words. There was no other way! Unless he truly gave up on the idea of leaving early, Su Yu was his only partner.

Feeling somewhat helpless, Gui quickly steeled himself, concealed his presence, and vanished into the void.

He had to find someone! The Culture King, and perhaps some other allies. Gui didn't know where the Culture King was at the moment, but it wouldn't be hard to find out. Many were hunting them recently, so it shouldn't be too difficult.
