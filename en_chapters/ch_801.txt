Chapter 801: Prison Green Breaks the Gate

Instantly killing Yue Hao!

At least, to outsiders, it seemed like an instant kill. In the blink of an eye, Yue Hao was gone.

At this moment, Yue Zhan, who was being blocked by Sun Corona and the Divine Consort, had a face as dark as iron!

Yue Qin, Yue Hao, Sword Servant, and Dou He—within just a few months, four members of the Celestial Race had fallen at Su Yu's hands!

As for the Heavenly Kings, although Su Yu hadn't killed any today, he had slain quite a few before.

The Holy Race had suffered such significant losses, all because of Su Yu.

Otherwise, the Control King's lineage was planning to wait until the Gate of Hell opened, or at least partially opened, allowing some powerful beings to return before sweeping through the Myriad Realms. They were just a step away!

If Su Yu hadn't interfered, they would still be a secretive existence!

If Su Yu hadn't interfered, even if they dragged it out until today, their lineage would have produced a true master of the power of laws!

Everything was because of Su Yu!

Yue Zhan was furious beyond measure, and in the distance, Prison Green's voice rang out again, shouting, "Defend, defend with all your might! Delay them for a moment!"

She was about to emerge!

Defend!

They couldn't continue fighting. If they did, all these powerful beings would be killed, and her emergence would be meaningless.

If they were all dead, how could she alone contend with these Celestial beings?

Four Celestial beings had already died!

Yet, at this moment, Su Yu wore a smile and said, "What are you standing around for? Keep killing!"

With that, Su Yu and his two companions appeared beside the Poro Dragon Beast. The Poro Dragon Beast's eyes changed, "Little bug, if I come out, you will surely die. Do you still want to kill me?"

Once was enough, and now again!

At this moment, those Celestial beings and Heavenly Kings actually wanted to withdraw the Gate of Hell, but... they couldn't!

If they withdrew it, the Poro Dragon Beast would dissipate. Once it dissipated, Su Yu's side, with seven Celestial beings, would have no restraints!

So, even though they knew Marquis Tongtian could devour the Gate of Hell, they didn't dare to withdraw it.

No one wanted such an outcome.

There were four Celestial gates: one each for Yue Luo and the twins, and the fourth belonged to the white-haired elder. The previous Gate of Hell had actually been devoured once by Marquis Tongtian, and this time, it was very weak.

If it were devoured again, he would surely be severely injured.

However, the white-haired elder didn't dare to withdraw it, fearing that doing so would cause the Poro Dragon Beast to dissipate, leading Su Yu and his people to target them, which would be a true disaster!

At this moment, Su Yu smiled as he looked at the Poro Dragon Beast, playfully saying, "You should die once more!"

"Kill!"

This time, he didn't use the power of the heavens and earth because this creature was merely a projection of will. Once killed, the main body might sense something, and Su Yu didn't want the beings behind the Gate of Hell to know about his situation so soon.

Even without the assistance of the heavens and earth, it didn't matter.

Seven Celestial beings, with Su Yu and Fat Ball being top-tier existences—if they couldn't kill this projection of the Poro Dragon Beast, then this creature's projection could contend with a master of the power of laws!

In other directions, battles erupted rapidly!

The slaughter began once more!

Yue Zhan and his group fought while retreating, mainly defending!

They retreated towards the Gate of Hell!

Yue Zhan was indeed powerful. Even with the Divine Consort and Sun Corona joining forces against him, they could only barely hold their ground. In truth, the Divine Consort could be stronger, but Sun Corona repeatedly shielded her, showing a solemn expression and slightly shaking his head.

The Consort must not die at this moment!

The great battle hadn't ceased. If the Consort were to unleash her full power and die here, the future of the Divine Race would be uncertain.

Sun Corona didn't want the Divine Consort to die now, even if it meant killing Yue Zhan, it wasn't worth it.

And the Divine Consort also restrained herself. She glanced at Su Yu's side, feeling heavy-hearted. Even if a master of the power of laws from the Control King's lineage appeared, and even if they were killed, Su Yu's side couldn't be easily ignored.

She... couldn't die now!

According to the original plan, she would perish together with Yue Zhan!

But at this moment, the Divine Consort held back. She couldn't die, at least not now!

...

While they held back, Su Yu didn't.

Although going all out felt foolish, acting as a tool for the myriad races... in reality, it was the other way around. The myriad races were acting as his tools!

He was weakening both sides!

Su Yu's goal wasn't just one side; both sides needed to be weakened to meet his expectations.

Of course, this was also the goal of the myriad races and the Sin Race!

At this moment, the myriad races were holding off powerful enemies for him, allowing him to go all out against his opponents. Wasn't this a delightful thing?

So Su Yu fought with great enthusiasm!

Heaven-Opening Blade!

Five Elements Purgatory!

Expanding God Hammer!

All sorts of techniques were used by Su Yu against the Poro Dragon Beast, and the Poro Dragon Beast was extremely aggrieved, almost dying from frustration!

His true body was very powerful!

But this was not his true body.

Su Yu and his group, seven top-tier existences, were attacking him together. The fact that he wasn't instantly killed showed he was stronger than Marquis Ziyun.

But... it was useless!

Boom!

Another loud explosion, and within him, a Heavenly King's portal directly shattered. Before the Poro Dragon Beast could cry out, Marquis Tongtian suddenly screamed, "No, don't!"

A portal shattered!

Even if it was just a Heavenly King's portal, it was still a portal, and he didn't want it shattered!

He was heartbroken to the point of fainting, shrieking, "Don't break the portal, don't break the portal!"

He shouted, his voice filled with anguish.

He glared viciously at the Giant Axe, wishing he could chop him to pieces.

Because it was the Giant Axe who had split a portal with one strike, and he was heartbroken to the point of explosion!

Marquis Giant Axe was also helpless!

Damn it.

We're fighting and killing here, who has time to care about your portal?

The Poro Dragon Beast was extremely aggrieved, and finally, he glared at them, gritting his teeth, and without a word, the nine portals within him trembled violently.

He wanted to self-destruct these portals and his willpower!

Beast!

I'll self-destruct and not let you gain any benefits!

Wishful thinking!

Even if I self-destruct, I'll make sure you suffer, you bastards, bullying this great existence of mine. Even though my true body isn't here, having my avatar beaten like this is a disgrace.

Moreover, this wasn't the first time; it was the second time today!

Absolutely unacceptable!

He came out to slaughter all sides, not to be devoured and give benefits!

He was just about to self-destruct when Su Yu sensed it, and so did Marquis Tongtian. At this moment, Marquis Tongtian was truly anxious, shrieking, "Don't self-destruct, don't, please don't..."

"......"

Su Yu and the others had black lines on their foreheads!

Damn!

Anyone who didn't know would think your relative was about to self-destruct. This is your opponent, you know, do you really need to act like this just because you want to eat the portal?

Marquis Tongtian was so anxious he was about to cry, "I won't hit you anymore, just don't self-destruct, please don't self-destruct..."

"Shut up!"

Su Yu couldn't take it anymore, shouting angrily, embarrassing!

On the battlefield, many people were moved to tears by Marquis Tongtian's shrill cries. It was your enemy about to self-destruct, and it was an avatar of an ancient existence, not you about to self-destruct.

You beat them so miserably, to the point they want to self-destruct, and you still have the nerve to cry!

Everyone was speechless!

The Poro Dragon Beast was also laughing in anger, roaring, "When my true body emerges, I will kill you all!"

What a disgrace!

The opponent didn't want him to self-destruct because they wanted to eat him, damn it!

When had he, the Poro Dragon Venerable, fallen to such a state?

"Sigh!"

Seeing Marquis Tongtian about to cry, Su Yu was also helpless. This embarrassing fellow, you don't deserve to be a Celestial, forget it, to prevent him from actually crying... if the Poro Dragon Beast self-destructed, he would definitely cry.

To avoid further embarrassment, Su Yu decided not to give him the chance to self-destruct!

As long as I'm fast enough... Fat Ball can devour his willpower, and through the Gate of Hell, his true body might not know anything.

In an instant, the heavens and earth reappeared!

"Silence!"

A low shout rang out, "Misfortune!"

"Dispel!"

In an instant, several great daos erupted, silencing the opponent, attaching misfortune, dispelling the power of self-destruction.

The Poro Dragon Beast suddenly felt a hitch in his breath... a hitch?

He was stunned for a moment, why would an avatar have a hitch in breath?

In an instant, the gathered power of self-destruction suddenly dissipated.

Before he could figure it out, Su Yu and the seven others appeared, launching a frenzied assault, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to shatter. Marquis Tongtian frantically devoured those portals, instantly swallowing a Heavenly King's portal!

Keep devouring, keep devouring, devour more!

Devouring caused the Poro Dragon Beast's aura to plummet, and only then did the Poro Dragon Beast react. He was stunned, "Heaven Opener?"

He had seen it before!

At this moment, he seemed to recall something, recalling the end of chaos, recalling that figure who emerged from chaos, opening the heavens and earth, creating the Myriad Realms!

The Master of Time!

That Heaven Opener was not comparable to Su Yu. When that person opened the heavens, countless chaotic powerhouses tried to stop him, forbidding the opening of the heavens!

That person, with one sword, slaughtered chaos into oblivion!

Slaughtered until corpses were strewn everywhere!

Slaughtered until the Myriad Realms were opened with blood!

Heaven Opener?

Fear!

Instantly, that scene flashed in his mind, leaving only fear. After fear came shock; this information must be transmitted back. While this guy is still weak, find a way to kill him!

Otherwise, it will be difficult to restrain him later!

But at this moment, it was too late. Fat Ball's large mouth reached out, swallowing his willpower, and Marquis Tongtian roared, disregarding everything, eat!

Eat everything!

Eat, eat, eat!

Nine portals, he wanted to devour them all. He couldn't bear to give up, even though he was really about to burst, but he couldn't bear to let go!

Without the Control King's lineage, if he wanted to devour the power of the portals again, he would have to eat Su Yu, or eat the Martial Emperor, or go eat the Culture King, Human Emperor, and those people.

Could he eat them?

Only now was the last chance!

He had to eat!

Boom!

Marquis Tongtian transformed into a great gate, and at this moment, the gate was faintly cracking. Su Yu couldn't help but curse, "Spit it out..."

Are you happy to blow yourself up?

No spitting!

Even if it kills him, he won't spit it out!

Marquis Tongtian knew what Su Yu was worried about, but... he couldn't spit it out. If he did, it would be hard to have such an opportunity again!

Su Yu had almost exterminated the Control King's lineage today!

If he spat it out, should he go eat the Heaven Gate?

The portal he had transformed into was being buffeted by a powerful force, scattering wildly. In an instant, Su Yu retracted his power of laws.

At that moment, deep within the Gate of Hell, a faint sense of fear reverberated back. The next instant, a furious roar echoed in all directions: "Su Yu, once I get out, I will kill you!"

It was the true form of the Chaos Dragon Beast!

He was filled with anger, confusion, and... fear? At the last moment, his willpower had transmitted an emotion of fear. What a joke! His avatar and he were one; he was so powerful, how could he feel fear?

...

Boom!

Explosions rang out from within Marquis Tongtian's body. Some of the portals were forcibly devoured by him, while others exploded!

At this moment, the twins, Moon Luo, and the white-haired elder all spat blood. Their foreheads split open!

The same happened to some of the Heavenly Kings; their foreheads burst open. In an instant, two Heavenly Kings, already on the brink, were slain on the spot by the myriad races' experts.

The white-haired elder was shattered a second time, suffering severe injuries!

His opponent was the strongest of the Immortal Race, the Holy Marquis. With a single palm strike, the Holy Marquis shattered his body and head. Though a new head quickly grew, he was in grave danger of falling!

At this moment, Moon Luo, who had previously helped the white-haired elder fend off Tiangu and Yuan Sheng, let out a piercing scream. Everyone's spirits shook, and their eardrums ruptured.

Moon Luo's forehead split open, but her aura grew stronger!

She didn't weaken; she became even stronger!

At this moment, a colorful ribbon suddenly appeared in her hand. In an instant, it swept out, pulling the white-haired elder away. She herself also retreated swiftly, fleeing with the elder toward the Gate of Hell!

Seeing this, Moon Battle and the twins also fled, as did the two Heavenly Venerables of the Demon Race!

Escape!

They could no longer fight!

...

Su Yu did not make a move.

At this moment, his eyes narrowed.

Moon Luo... was stronger than before. This woman, to save the white-haired elder, didn't hide her strength. Strange.

Quickly, he understood the general situation.

Su Yu's eyes narrowed.

They were in cahoots!

Yes, they were in cahoots.

Moon Luo and that white-haired elder were in cahoots, possibly... both were people of Hundred Battle!

In other words, these two Heavenly Venerables were actually people of Hundred Battle.

Unbelievable, not just one, but two!

Perhaps among those Heavenly Kings and Daofuse experts, there were also people of Hundred Battle, but compared to Heavenly Venerables, they were less valuable. So, although some had died before, Moon Luo hadn't gone all out.

It wasn't until this moment, seeing the white-haired elder about to be killed, that Moon Luo had no choice but to act and save the elder!

Su Yu looked at Thunderstorm, who lowered his head, not daring to speak.

Su Yu laughed!

"Interesting!"

The voice echoed in Thunderstorm's ears: "Really interesting! Among the remaining five Heavenly Venerables of the Control King's lineage, two are actually people of Hundred Battle. I wonder if the Control King's lineage wants to cry!"

Seven Heavenly Venerables fled!

But the remaining Heavenly Kings and Daofuse experts couldn't escape!

Tiangu and the others pursued and killed these guys, while Su Yu didn't bother to chase. He swiftly killed the experts of the Control King's lineage, including those of the Demon Race!

Some from the Demon Race escaped!

Yes, Su Yu saw it. Demon Halberd and a few other demons who had ascended from the lower realm decisively fled. In fact, they had long wanted to escape. At this moment, seeing others in retreat, they didn't hesitate, burning their blood essence to break through the void and flee!

Some from the God Race and Immortal Race wanted to pursue, but soon gave up.

Jiwu and the others watched them escape with complex expressions, not pursuing further. Demon Halberd and the others had cooperated well with various races in the lower realm. At this moment, their strength was weak, so let them escape!

These guys had just arrived in the Upper Realm and might not even know what had happened.

Today, the Demon Race suddenly cooperated with the Control King's lineage, leading to the death of many Demon Race experts.

If they couldn't turn the tide, the Demon Race would be finished!

...

Su Yu didn't care about those guys. He led March and the others, swiftly killing the fleeing experts.

In this place, Daofuse experts were cannon fodder.

The slaughter continued unabated.

He didn't pursue because he knew that Yu Qing was about to emerge!

Sure enough, when Moon Battle and the others fled near the Gate of Hell, a booming sound erupted, and an incomparably powerful aura exploded forth. At this moment, the world fell silent!

A terrifying existence, a true master of the power of laws, appeared!

This might be the first time in ten thousand years that a complete combat power of a master of the power of laws appeared in the Myriad Realms. Before this, whether it was the Martial Emperor or the Necromancer Emperor, they were both in a sealed state.

As for Hundred Battle, his current strength was unknown. Even if he was at this level, he hadn't gone all out!

In the deep mountains, a fearsome existence clad in black armor took step after step forward.

Moon Battle and the others were overjoyed!

He was out!

Finally, he was out!

"Supreme!"

"Senior Sister!"

"......"

The fleeing Heavenly Venerables were overjoyed, some even crying tears of joy.

They were all dead!

Apart from the seven Heavenly Venerables, less than ten Daofuse experts escaped with them!

One must know, previously, the Demon Race and the Control King's lineage had over a hundred Daofuse experts. Now, including them, less than twenty remained!

The losses were too severe!

At this moment, Tiangu and the others also halted.

All the experts gathered together.

There were still over a hundred Daofuse experts, more than ten Heavenly Kings, plus some Heavenly Venerables.

At this time, these people all gathered together, each with a solemn expression.

He was out!

After several Heavenly Venerables were killed, and the Heavenly Kings were almost wiped out, he came out. His emergence was a bit late, perhaps related to his luck being stripped away by Su Yu.

"Very good!"

Yu Qing was incomparably cold, stepping into the air, instantly appearing before Moon Battle and the others. His eyes were like sharp swords, looking towards Su Yu and the others. Su Yu and his group were fine, but the other Daofuse experts were bleeding from their seven orifices.

Rank suppression!

At this moment, the rank suppression was vividly displayed!

A true master of the power of laws!

Yu Qing's aura exploded, overwhelming the surroundings, intimidating all directions!

His strength might not necessarily be much stronger than Moon Battle and the others, but his aura was truly oppressive. This was probably the first time Su Yu had seen such a powerful presence, including the previous Lord of the Undead. Only now did Su Yu understand that at that moment, the Lord of the Undead might not have reached the level of a master of the power of laws!

Yu Qing, wearing black leather boots, clad in battle armor, holding a black spear, dressed entirely in black, walked step by step. Even though Su Yu's side had many Heavenly Venerables, she was unafraid!

Even if she couldn't kill many people alone, if she wanted to escape, it would be difficult for these people to stop her!

A master of the power of laws is a master of the power of laws!

Heavenly Venerables, even if they comprehend the same, do not mean they are masters of the power of laws!

No matter how top-tier a Heavenly Venerable is, there is still a gap!

She walked step by step, and wherever her gaze fell, people retreated. When she saw Su Yu, Su Yu smiled, appearing very calm, and said, "Congratulations! Report your name, so everyone can get to know you!"

Yu Qing's gaze was cold and stern, coldly saying, "Yu Qing! Ninth disciple under the Holy Lord!"

Su Yu inhaled, "A disciple of the Control King? Don't joke, you're only ranked ninth. The Control King has nine disciples who are masters of the power of laws? Don't be ridiculous. If that's true, wouldn't the Human Emperor and Culture King be embarrassed?"

I don't believe it!

Does the Human Emperor have disciples who are masters of the power of laws?

Speaking of which... do they even have disciples?

The Culture King has some students, but they are all registered disciples, seemingly without formal disciples.

As for the Human Emperor, it seems he doesn't have any either!

But regardless of whether they do or not, Su Yu doesn't believe they have nine disciples who are masters of the power of laws!

Of course, it's hard to say!

What's behind the Gate of Hell, no one knows. Maybe... there really are!

Could it be that most of the Control King's disciples went behind the gate?

Did they break through behind the gate?

If so, producing nine is understandable.

"Impudent!"

Yu Qing was incomparably cold, "How dare you directly call the Holy Lord by name, are you courting death!"

Su Yu laughed, "Even if the Control King stood in front of me, he would just be a traitor, unworthy of speaking to me! I am the Human Lord, the lord of the Human Race. He, a traitor of the Human Race, bringing some little traitors, dares to speak arrogantly in front of me? You too, a master of the power of laws, don't know who you are, do you?"

Su Yu mocked, "A master of the power of laws, plus seven Heavenly Venerables, is that strong?"

He glanced around, smiling, "Let me see, on our side... it seems there are quite a few Heavenly Venerables!"

There were already seven on his side!

Four from the Immortal Race, three from the God Race... but Moon Heavenly Venerable's body was gone, so count it as two.

Add the Nether, Phoenix, and Heavenly Venerable powers, plus the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger, there were a total of ten more.

Seventeen Heavenly Venerable-level experts!

Yu Qing ignored him, looking at the Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger, her gaze cold and stern, "Are you going to betray?"

At this moment, a towering aura faintly appeared on her body, the aura of chaos, the will of chaos, representing the will of those powerful beings in the world behind the gate!

A wave of chaotic will surged through the heavens and earth!

The ancient beasts behind the Eight-Winged Tiger and Tailless Dragon suddenly roared, their eyes blood-red, and in an instant, they charged at the myriad races' experts around them!

Boom!

This indeed caught everyone off guard.

The Heavenly Venerables all acted, not caring whether they were brought by the Eight-Winged Tiger, they all attacked!

In the blink of an eye, more than ten ancient beasts were killed, but it also led to the fall of seven or eight Daofuse experts on the myriad races' side!

Daofuse experts died like dogs!

In just an instant, over twenty died.

The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger both roared, their eyes blood-red, staring at Yu Qing.

Yu Qing was incomparably calm, "You are all ancient chaotic races. Defying the will of chaos is courting death, isn't it? At this moment, come over, serve me, and you can redeem your sins. Otherwise... you will die!"

On her body, the chaotic will grew stronger, interfering with the two ancient chaotic beasts.

At this time, the myriad races quickly distanced themselves from the two ancient beasts.

Too terrifying!

Tiangu and the others were also apprehensive.

Could these two not resist the interference of chaos?

At that moment, Su Yu grumbled, "Alright, enough with the act. You think you can pretend to defect and then deliver a fatal blow? Give it up. That old woman will never fully trust you!"

"Huh?" The Eight-Winged Tiger suddenly snapped to attention, looking puzzled. "Why wouldn't she trust us?"

"..." Silence fell over the area, and even Yu Qing's expression shifted slightly.

They weren't affected?

Su Yu, somewhat exasperated, said, "If she's not stupid, she obviously won't trust you..."

"But I think she's pretty stupid!" The Eight-Winged Tiger grumbled in frustration. "Emperor Yu, could you stop messing things up? We painstakingly devised several plans, and you've ruined them all! I thought that when she controlled us, we could let her think she had control, but you... Not everyone is as cunning... ahem, as well-read as you!"

He was utterly vexed! Su Yu, damn you! Yu Qing might not have noticed, but my plan was brilliant. I pretended to be under her control! Then, you all would fight until both sides were exhausted, and I, along with the Tailless Dragon, would turn the tables. Damn you, Su Yu, damn your ancestors, your whole family is a bunch of bastards! You've messed it up again!

The Eight-Winged Tiger, fuming, said, "Emperor Yu, we agreed to do our own things. Why do you keep interfering with my plans?"

Su Yu shrugged. "I just think she's not that dumb. If she sends you as the vanguard, isn't that declaring war on me? What if I accidentally kill you? And you, Chaos Dragon, still pretending? Your tail's been severed for days now, and it hasn't healed? You, who can fight in a Moon Battle, are overdoing it. You and the Eight-Winged Tiger teamed up against the twins, and they didn't get a scratch. That's over the top!"

"..." The Chaos Dragon also regained clarity and looked at Su Yu, somewhat helpless. "Su Yu, why do you keep sabotaging our plans?"

"..." At this moment, everyone was stunned.

Damn! These two ancient beasts were pretending all along, including their strength and their supposed loss of control. They were just playing Yu Qing for a fool, weren't they?

Across from them, Yu Qing's expression darkened. She asked in a deep voice, "How did you break free from control?"

The beings behind the chaos had strong control over the chaotic ancient beasts! Otherwise, they wouldn't have let her out to represent chaos and subdue those beasts. Yet, as soon as she emerged, two ancient beasts broke free! Impossible!

The Eight-Winged Tiger flapped its wings. Why should I tell you? It bluntly said, "You strip away the chaotic will, and the Chaos Dragon and I will split it and leave! No need to fight to the death over chaotic will, Yu Qing. You're strong, but even if the Chaos Dragon and I can't match you together... can you handle everyone here?"

Su Yu, smiling, added, "Give me the chaotic will, and I'll leave immediately, as promised! Yu Qing, killing me won't be easy!"

"..." The faces of Tiangu and the others changed!

Are you kidding?

But Su Yu was serious. "I'm not lying. I do want to kill you, but... if I really fight to the death, someone might take advantage. You don't think you're the strongest in the Myriad Realms, do you? Think again! Even I don't dare to be careless, let alone you, who just emerged!"

Su Yu laughed. "Besides, are Yue Luo and the White-Haired Ghost really yours? With your intelligence... you might not even see through it!"

Su Yu laughed heartily. "I never stopped you from coming out. Otherwise, do you think you could have come out so smoothly? I let you out to restrain some people, understand?"

Yu Qing coldly stared at him, speaking in a low voice, "You must die!"

Su Yu's expression turned cold. "Are you forcing me to kill you? Do you really think you're the strongest in the Myriad Realms? Do you believe I can't summon a master of the rules to fight you to the death?"

Everyone was shocked. Was he serious?

At that moment, Su Yu suddenly shouted, "Zhou Ji, if you don't come, Yue Luo and this White-Haired Ghost will die. Don't you care about your stepmother?"

Zhou Ji!

As soon as these words were spoken, the surroundings shook. Behind Yu Qing, Yue Luo's face changed slightly as she looked at Su Yu. "Su Yu, do you think your little tricks will work?"

Su Yu said calmly, "Do you have any idea? Your son... never mind, you're the mistress, he might not acknowledge you. Should I call your man to save you? Isn't it a bit harsh if he doesn't?"

Yue Luo sneered. "Su Yu, are you scared because the Supreme Yu Qing has returned? Using these underhanded tricks to slander me!"

She continued coldly, "Supreme, Su Yu is a smooth talker, skilled at sowing discord!"

Yu Qing said calmly, "I know."

However, at this moment, Tiangu suddenly spoke, "Zhou Ji?"

He looked at Su Yu, his expression changing. "Human Lord... are you talking about the son of Hundred Battle?"

Su Yu laughed. "Guess!"

"..." I'm not guessing! You've made it so clear, what's there to guess?

His mind was in turmoil, and suddenly he felt a deep sense of sorrow. He spoke, "Human Lord, does Hundred Battle... also have many powerful subordinates in the lower realm?"

Su Yu laughed. "Guess again!"

I'm not guessing!

Tiangu, in fact, vaguely understood something. At this moment, he felt inexplicably sad. So, the rule of the Myriad Races over the past 6,000 years was actually a joke! Hundred Battle, Su Yu, the lineage of the Control King... the rule of the Myriad Races was so fragile!

Yu Qing looked at Su Yu, her eyes cold. "Since you want peace... then let's end it here today. You all retreat, and this battle will be over!"

She suddenly changed her attitude! From calling for bloodshed to suddenly not wanting to kill.

Because Yu Qing understood one thing: whether it's the Myriad Races, Su Yu, or the Chaos Dragon and the others, they won't stay united forever. Rather than fighting to the death now, it's better to wait until they disperse and retreat!

They will separate eventually!

Taking them down one by one is more suitable for her!

Not too stupid!

That's Su Yu's thought as well. At this point, she won't be too stupid.

Yu Qing is actually very wise!

At this moment, the three sides are united, but once they retreat, whether through division or recruitment, it will definitely be easier than now. Now, all three sides are worried she will kill, so they are gathered together.

Yu Qing continued, looking at the strong of the Myriad Races, saying calmly, "Fighting until now, Su Yu's side is unscathed! Myriad Races, do you really want to be his scapegoat? You've suffered heavy losses. What will you gain in the end? Even though you have many Heavenly Sovereigns, if I go all out, disregarding everything, and bring the Moon Battle and others, just to kill the Myriad Races' Heavenly Sovereigns, you all will probably die! Even if we die... the beneficiaries won't be you!"

The strong of the Myriad Races changed color.

If the lineage of the Control King really targets them, that would be troublesome.

Su Yu sighed and said, "What you said, who said I didn't suffer losses? Two of my Heavenly Kings had their Great Daos broken, and several Heavenly Kings died before... You all are too ruthless! I don't have much foundation, yet you kill my people like this!"

Then, he laughed. "Thunderstorm, Destiny, step aside. You're not my people. Why pretend to be? Go back to Hundred Battle. Why come to me?"

"I'm not taking the blame!"

Su Yu shrugged. "I have five Heavenly Sovereigns, and Hundred Battle's people haven't even come. There are four Heavenly Sovereigns here. That's what's scary!"

Su Yu squinted and smiled. "Now, the strongest side in the Myriad Realms is Hundred Battle, followed by your Sin Clan, then the Myriad Races, and finally me... After that, it's these two lonely chaotic beasts. Really pitiful! At least I'm a bit stronger than them!"

The Chaos Dragon and Eight-Winged Tiger remained silent.

Damn you!

The Eight-Winged Tiger knew that Destiny was Su Yu's person, and Su Yu might have more people in the depths of chaos, quite a few strong ones. Who's he fooling?

Yu Qing looked at Su Yu, no longer agitated, and said calmly, "How about this, let's all disperse. I promise not to attack you! I came out of the Gate of Hell this time just to explore the path for chaos... to find a way back! In this Myriad Realms, it's not just us who want to return; there are many others. You and I are both pawns. Why fight each other?"

She didn't come out shouting for bloodshed, which, instead, made the Myriad Races somewhat tempted.

At this moment, they couldn't see many things clearly and were worried that the master of the rules would really erupt in slaughter, targeting them. Retreating... might be a good thing!

Of course, the premise is that after retreating, Yu Qing won't take them down one by one!

Tiangu looked at Su Yu, then at Yu Qing, and said in a deep voice, "Retreat... are we just waiting for Supreme Yu Qing to reorganize her strength and strike us with thunder?"

Yu Qing said calmly, "Open the lower realm passage, you go to the lower realm, close the lower realm passage, and we are separated by a realm. Naturally, there won't be a chance for a thunderous strike. You have the suppression of your realm in the lower realm. Even I can't completely discard it..."

Su Yu sneered. "She's human, even if she doesn't admit it, she still is. Do you believe her? Just hearing this, you know it's unreliable!"

Sure enough, several people, including Sun Corona, changed color.

Yes, she's human. Even if she says she's of the Holy Clan now, she's essentially human!

...

Su Yu said a few words, but in his heart, he was thinking.

If this continues, maybe... this battle really won't happen, as long as Yu Qing can give the Myriad Races enough assurance.

At this time, the Myriad Races are actually afraid too.

On one hand, they're afraid of Su Yu's side; on the other, they're afraid of Yu Qing and the Myriad Races perishing together.

But this won't do!

Together, they're still too strong!

He glanced at Yue Luo and the others. Hundred Battle, don't you have any intention of stirring things up?

The Hundred Battle side, are they really just going to wait it out?

That's not the style of Hundred Battle!

The lineage of the Control King and the myriad races both suffered heavy losses. Was this Hundred Battle King's intention all along? Could it be that because he sealed off the lower realm, Hundred Battle King truly has no way to communicate with the Upper Realm?

Thoughts flickered through Su Yu's mind as he pondered the situation. Ceasing the battle now wasn't impossible, but his goals had yet to be achieved.

"We can't stop the battle now!"

If they didn't fight this time, the myriad races might be devoured!

He glanced at Tiangu, frowning slightly. Tiangu, have you realized it yet? If they didn't seize this last burst of momentum to fight, the myriad races would soon become nothing but scattered sand!

...

Tiangu was aware of this. Yet, at this moment, he hesitated, feeling a sense of sorrow. The myriad races were truly powerless to resist! Whether it was Su Yu, Hundred Battle King, or the Control King's lineage... perhaps only the myriad races were the weakest!

If they fought now, both sides would suffer. If they didn't fight, soon, some individuals might be swayed, choosing to ally with various races, and in the end, the resistance of the myriad races would become a joke!

Because all three factions were human!

The myriad races had resisted the humans for many years, and in the end, they still became vassals of the humans! This was something they couldn't accept!

Tiangu looked around. Despite the current large numbers of the myriad races, the reality was that this was their entire strength. Meanwhile, neither Su Yu nor the Control King's lineage had revealed their full power!

The Control King's lineage still had powerful figures behind their gates! As for Su Yu... who knows, perhaps the Death Realm still hid a group of strong individuals.

To fight or to retreat?

He didn't know!

At this moment, Tiangu was truly lost. What path should they take in the future? Six thousand years of dominance had become a colossal joke! Could they still wait for the return of the Immortal Emperor and others?

At this moment, he suddenly sent a voice transmission to Su Yu: "If you are willing to lift the seal on the myriad races, I am willing to fight the Sin Clan to the death right now! Su Yu, as long as you agree... today, the myriad races will be at your command!"

Only by breaking the seal would there be a chance! Otherwise, there would be no chance at all!

At this moment, Su Yu's eyes flickered. Tiangu, this sly fox, really knew how to seize the moment and focus on the key point.

Unsealing!

If the myriad races were unsealed, even if a few more Celestial Sovereigns died in this battle, if three to five remained, they could become rulers of the laws. Once they became rulers of the laws, the opportunity would arise!

By then, some top-tier combat power would be evened out! Figures like Yu Qing would no longer be invincible!

Yet, at this moment, it was Su Yu who hesitated. Unseal? Was it worth it?
