Chapter 738: All Preparations in Place

"Greetings, Marquis of Riftspace!"

At this moment, Su Yu, with a smile on his face, resumed his true form and looked at the Marquis of Riftspace. The Marquis, who hadn't actually strangled Kong Kong, returned the greeting with a slight bow, "Riftspace greets the Human Lord!"

The two exchanged pleasantries, and the Marquis of Riftspace recognized a few individuals, such as Doubao and Marquis Huoyun. Glancing around, the Marquis said softly, "This place is not suitable for a long stay. Would the Human Lord mind discussing matters further inside the mansion?"

After all, this was the outside, and it wasn't very convenient. Within the dojo, generally, no one dared to probe recklessly. Even the Heavenly Sovereigns wouldn't do so easily, as it might invite trouble.

"With pleasure!"

Su Yu chuckled. The Marquis of Riftspace easily opened a space, revealing the scene on the other side, as if compressing two spaces into one, allowing a clear view of the opposite side.

Beside him, the Great Zhou King praised, "The Marquis of Riftspace's mastery of space is truly unparalleled and extraordinary!"

"You flatter me!"

The Marquis of Riftspace smiled, though the Great Zhou King's words were indeed true. After all, if the Space Ancient Beast Race didn't excel in spatial abilities, they wouldn't be worthy of the name.

Su Yu said no more and stepped in. The Marquis of Riftspace raised an eyebrow slightly but said nothing. This Human Lord was indeed bold. But upon reflection, it was quite normal. With so many powerful beings accompanying him, unless several Heavenly Sovereign-level experts came, it would be difficult to capture him. How could he not be bold?

...

Inside the enormous mansion.

There wasn't much luxurious decoration, just one word—big! Truly big! The Space Ancient Beasts had large true forms, so within the mansion, they couldn't always maintain a human form. Thus, the size was a necessity. Excessive decoration wasn't needed; otherwise, when the true form was restored, everything would be crushed.

The Marquis of Riftspace was straightforward. Upon entering the mansion, he invited everyone to sit and got straight to the point, "Is the Human Lord here for our race's teleportation gates?"

"Indeed."

Su Yu nodded. "So, the Space Ancient Race truly has a large number of teleportation gates?"

"There are indeed."

The Marquis of Riftspace didn't hide anything. Since they had come, she was straightforward, "Those teleportation gates were built at great cost and effort by our race, opening up numerous dangerous places. Over the years, more than one Daofuse cultivator has fallen for this cause, and even a quasi-king has perished!"

"They were originally meant for the future of our race, so that if a great war broke out, the Space Ancient Race could seek refuge at any time..."

Su Yu listened silently and nodded, "The Marquis of Riftspace is right. So, what price must I pay to borrow one of these space gates now?"

"Which gate? To where?"

"The inner perimeter of Chaos Mountain!"

Su Yu looked at the Marquis of Riftspace. Is there one?

The Marquis frowned, not rushing to reply, but her attitude indicated that there was indeed one. Su Yu was secretly shocked! There really is one!

The Marquis of Riftspace said solemnly, "Back then, to open this passage, a quasi-king of our race was gravely injured and died shortly after!"

The cost was enormous!

Su Yu was also shaken. A quasi-king had fallen for this. The price was not easy to bear.

Seeing his silence, the Marquis of Riftspace paused before speaking, "Now, with the great war about to erupt, the three major races intend to sweep the Upper Realm. The teleportation gates in other dangerous places might all be destroyed! Only Chaos Mountain hasn't been breached yet; it might be our race's last refuge!"

Having paid such a huge price to open these gates, they might all end up being wasted. The Marquis of Riftspace felt immense sorrow. However, there was no choice. The gate at Chaos Mountain might be the last retreat.

And if Su Yu borrowed it, it might not be returned. Even if it was, it might no longer be secret. Without secrecy, what kind of retreat would it be?

Su Yu considered for a moment and said, "What are the Marquis of Riftspace's conditions? If it's feasible and not excessive, I will try my best to meet them."

"Conditions?"

The Marquis glanced at Kong Kong and said in a low voice, "In the Lower Realm, our race has already pledged allegiance to the Luminous Domain Mansion. The old fellow down there is my Dao companion; we are one and the same, so how can we be distinguished?"

With a sigh, carrying some helplessness, she continued, "Our race has always been neutral. The old fellow believes the Human Lord can become the second emperor. I am not familiar with the Human Lord and cannot know if there is truly hope."

"Now, with the three major races gathering the myriad races at Ren Mountain, I might not be able to take these space gates with me."

"If that's the case, giving them to the Human Lord as a favor isn't out of the question."

"As for conditions... the Human Lord's invincibility is the greatest benefit to our race. If the Human Lord is defeated... any conditions would be meaningless to me!"

She shook her head. What conditions would be useful? In truth, nothing would be.

At present, survival is the only goal!

The situation is unclear, and who will win or lose cannot be known now. Su Yu's side has many quasi-kings, not weaker than any of the three major races. With March, they should be able to match one of the three major races, but the three major races are not just one race!

Of course, Su Yu's side is developing rapidly, with many strong individuals in a period of progress. The old antiques of the myriad races have been stuck at certain realms for too many years. Su Yu's side indeed has greater potential.

After weighing the situation, the Marquis of Riftspace continued, "All those things can be handed over to the Human Lord. I don't have many thoughts or ideas. The only condition is that unless the Human Lord openly declares allegiance and has the confidence to resist the three major races or the Chaos lineage... otherwise, our Space Ancient Race will not openly support the Human Lord!"

She was straightforward, "And what the Human Lord needs to do is not to publicize any relationship with our race before the Lower Realm opens! Unless I am willing to assist actively, I will not be threatened into joining hands with the Human Lord at critical moments, regardless of race... that's not the outcome I want to see!"

Su Yu smiled, "So, in the Upper Realm, the Space Ancient Race will always align with the three major races."

"Yes!"

The Marquis of Riftspace nodded, "The Space Ancient Race cannot resist the three major races! The Iron Devourer Race at least has March as a Heavenly Sovereign. I am not even a Heavenly Sovereign; how can I resist the three major races? If the Human Lord can establish a foothold in the Upper Realm, then our race will naturally come to join... if not... I'm sorry, I only hope the Human Lord can spare us, give us a way out, and not let the Space Ancient Race be buried with you."

She looked at Su Yu, with only this request.

If Su Yu agreed, those teleportation gates would be his.

Except for the Chaos Mountain gate, the other gates were almost useless.

Keeping them served little purpose!

If the dangerous places were cleared, keeping the gates would only mean having an extra place to teleport to.

Su Yu smiled, "If I truly lose, won't the cooperation between the Space Ancient Race and me in the Lower Realm implicate the Upper Realm?"

The Marquis of Riftspace gritted her teeth, "If it truly comes to that... losing half is better than total annihilation! The old fellow has pledged allegiance to you, so he can plead guilty to the three major races... whether to kill or flay, it's up to the three major races. Our race excels in space, so there is still room for survival!"

Su Yu laughed.

His smile carried a touch of emotion.

All for the sake of the race!

A weak race can only be so passive.

Even if the Space Ancient Race isn't weak, at this time, they are still helpless, forced to consider the survival of their race.

Su Yu nodded, "Unless I have the strength to resist the myriad races and the Chaos Mountain lineage, I won't trouble the Marquis of Riftspace again, including Kong Kong. It's best if he stays here. One more Eternal, and the myriad races won't mind."

"Emperor Yu..."

Su Yu raised his hand, interrupting Kong Kong, and smiled, "You stay here for now. I won't be heading to the Lower Realm anytime soon. If you wish to go down, you can contact the Iron Devourer Race, and I'll take you down! Now, with the races sweeping the Upper Realm, it's quite dangerous. Staying with the Marquis of Riftspace is safer."

Kong Kong, feeling helpless, could only nod.

Lacking strength, there was no choice.

The Marquis of Riftspace said nothing more. Seeing Su Yu agree, and having learned a bit about Su Yu from Kong Kong, she didn't question anything.

Su Yu had carved out a territory in the Lower Realm, so he wouldn't be one to break promises.

Her power of laws fluctuated for a moment, and a space vortex appeared, "The teleportation gate is within. Would the Human Lord like to take a look?"

"Let's go together!"

Su Yu smiled, calling the others, and observed the space vortex himself. It was right here, and he hadn't sensed it before. Even without opening the Heaven Gate, the concealment was strong.

...

A group of people quickly entered the labyrinth.

Upon stepping in, they all gasped.

So many!

At least nearly a hundred gates.

The Marquis of Riftspace, initially proud, quickly turned dejected. They were all wasted!

With a sigh, she introduced them one by one, "This gate leads to Divine Fire Mountain. When our race's strong ones explored Divine Fire Mountain, Marquis Huoyun hadn't entered yet. Later, when we wanted to check again, we found that Marquis Huoyun had occupied the base we had left. This gate was considered wasted and hasn't been used since."

"......"

Marquis Huoyun was stunned, looking at her. The Marquis of Riftspace said calmly, "Marquis Huoyun is hiding in the 47th volcano of Divine Fire Mountain. When we went there, we should have discovered that the place was extremely suitable for hiding, with a large platform that could accommodate over ten thousand people..."

Marquis Huoyun was shocked, "Does the Marquis of Riftspace mean... that platform was developed by your race?"

The Marquis of Riftspace sighed, "No, but we discovered it. Seeing it was suitable for hiding, we established a space teleportation channel there. When we heard Marquis Huoyun was hiding there, we worried if it overlapped with our chosen spot. After testing, it turned out to be true, so we had to abandon that hiding place."

"......"

Marquis Huoyun was both shocked and relieved, quickly saying, "If the Space Ancient Race had informed the myriad races back then, wouldn't we have been..."

Finished?

The Marquis of Riftspace was indifferent, "This was our race's retreat. Why would we casually inform others? Informing other races that we have space channels in these places? Even if we destroyed Marquis Huoyun, what benefit would it bring us?"

Marquis Huoyun felt both fear and gratitude, quickly saying, "But I also explored back then and found no space channel."

裂空侯自信地说道：“我族的空间通道，都是先开辟，再封堵！也就是说，其实只是定位出一条路，打开了通道，之后又用空间之力封住了，你就算打破了空间，也只是以为是寻常的空间破碎……而不会追溯本源，寻找到我们这边。”

作为万族中最擅长空间一道的种族，裂空侯有资格骄傲。

“不止神火山，这是明月花谷的……不过也废了，明月花谷都没了。”

苏宇也是意外，“别说，当日我们也在明月花谷，还真没发现通道。”

裂空侯笑了笑，继续指着其他门户：“这是一线天的，这是天窟岭的，这是浮沉河的，这是云雾山的，这是坠魔涧的，这是葬魂山的……”

一道道门户，通往一处处险地，让人震动。空间古族，如同蜘蛛一般，在整个上界编制了一道道网线，贯穿了整个上界。

苏宇忍不住道：“那在各大族道场附近，没有通道？”

“有。”裂空侯轻咳一声：“当然有，只是……不动用罢了。”

“所以当日冥族被袭，其实，你不需要再另外开辟通道，完全可以直接传送过去？”

“门户没有携带，还是要开辟的。”裂空侯笑道：“只是，我知道那条通道在哪，其实可以沿着那条通道开辟，速度会很快，完全可以及时将冥天尊传送过去……不过……我为何要那么做？”

她当时可以迅速将冥天尊传送过去的。可是有什么好处？

她笑道：“当日我若是瞬间将冥天尊传送过去了，我的死期不远了！我族传送是厉害，可也需要时间，大家都知道的，往往是来不及的！若是我族瞬间抵达上界任何地方……空间古族就该覆灭了！这样的种族，不该存在！”

苏宇点头。这倒是真的。太可怕了！

此刻，他看着此地密密麻麻的门户，深吸一口气，“也就是说，这里，几乎是上界的交通枢纽之地，可以去上界任何地方，速度都极其快？”

“差不多吧！”裂空侯看着这门户，有些唏嘘：“我族为了这些，付出了太多！不过，算是半废了！而且几乎都没启动过，只是给我族留个退路罢了！”

她指了指一道巨大的门户：“那是道源之地的，但是只能传送到道源之地光幕之外，光幕内，容易被规则之力侵袭。”

说完，又指了指一道大门：“这就是混沌山内围的门户，当年我族那位准王深入混沌山内围，被古兽围攻，重伤垂死……混沌山内围，也有不少古兽，而且实力更强大，你们要小心了！”

她警告道：“内围的古兽，很强大，准王也不少！甚至可能存在天尊级的古兽，当然，我们没遇到就是了。内围广袤无边，山头无数，比外围还要大，混沌山，纵深不知千万里……可能直接连接了万界边缘！”

她沉声道：“诸位也知道，这万界，这上界，都是有极限的！极限之外，便是混沌，混沌山，便是混沌的蔓延，是万界和混沌的交接之地！在深处，有一道地狱之门，算是连接了万界和混沌的分界线！要说混沌一族可能在哪，我觉得大概率就在那边！”

“我族也曾探查过内围，没敢深入，但是我们探查的区域，恐怕不适合隐藏太多的人，三五百的还可以，可混沌一族按照推测，人数不少，甚至自成国度……那只能是在最深处了！”

苏宇点头。此刻的他，看向迷宫中的一道道大门，不由舔了舔嘴唇，好多！掌控此地，上界几乎任何地方都可以去了！

裂空侯大概知道他的心思，无奈道：“人主，最好不要用，用了……我族开辟大量通道的事，也许会暴露，除非万不得已，其他时候，我建议不要使用！”

苏宇瞬间清醒，点头：“这个我知道，放心吧！”

他指了指那混沌山的门户：“这个可以带走吗？”

裂空侯沉吟道：“尽量不要移动，在这，代表我们的通道入口开在了这里，一旦移动，那就需要重新开辟空间入口……”

说着，她又道：“在一条线上，就可以随时连接！”

“这么说吧，我们这里，和混沌山的直线路线，这条线上，任何一处，都可以用这道门户开启一个通道，但是……其他地方就不行了！”

“你要是在其他地方开启，那还得专门再开辟一条通道才行……这样动静就太大了。”

两点之间，直线距离上，可以任意一点上开个通道，错开这个直线，那就没办法了。

苏宇回想了一下空间古兽一族的地盘，以及混沌山所在方位，微微挑眉道：“那这么说，我在冥族那边，差不多也能开启，大体上在一条线上？”

“嗯！”裂空侯点头：“稍微连接一下就行，人主真要带走，我会教人主如何操控，如何和已有的通道联系起来。”

苏宇眼神雪亮，“那其他门户，也是如此吗？”

“大多都可以！”裂空侯点头：“都是直线之间，可以随意连接一点，但是不在一条线路上的话，就没办法了！还有一点，我要提醒人主，开启一次之后，就有可能被人感应到空间通道存在……所以，不要贸然动用！”

苏宇笑道：“一次就足够了！”哪还需要很多次的。当然，真到了后期，实力够了，被发现就被发现了好了。

苏宇想到这，又挑眉道：“现在各族挪移人山过去，会不会路过混沌山那条通道？若是的话，岂不是说，我有可能，直接传送到人山？”

“有这个可能。”裂空侯也没否认，“我判断了一下，若是按照之前定的地点，偏差不大，应该是可以传送到的，不过大概在山脚的位置，不会直接出现在山上。”

“足够了！”苏宇庆幸，这次没白来。就这满满的空间门，简直就是至宝！整个上界，几乎都囊括在了其中，苏宇又道：“现在万族扫荡上界险地，这些通道会被发现吗？”

“不会。”裂空侯摇头：“我说了，这些通道都是被封堵状态，和正常空间没差别，除非那些天尊闲着没事干，连空间都到处给打爆了，否则，不会影响通道的！但是险地没了，这些通道的价值大打折扣……不会成为避难之地了！”

苏宇舔了舔嘴唇，也不再说，问清楚了每道门户对应的地点，最后，苏宇深吸一口气道：“这些门户，我都要带走！空间古族，日后有何要求，尽管提！能做到的范围，必不推辞！”

裂空侯有些不舍，哪怕废了大半，她还是舍不得，这其中，他们一族付出了太大的代价。没有说话，默默看了一阵那些门户，许久，她叹息一声：“都带走吧，留着也是浪费了！”

苏宇拱手：“多谢了！”也不客气什么，他需要这些。

空间古兽一族耗费十万年，打造了这四通八达的传送体系，苏宇这边，大周王哪怕擅长，他一个人，不花个几百上千年，也开辟不出来这些通道。还得日以继夜才行！

而空间古兽一族，也不是天天开辟，而是趁着没人知晓的时候，一点点开辟出来的。恐怕万族也不敢相信，这些年，空间古族这些家伙，如同蜘蛛似的，织了一张覆盖上界的大网！

裂空侯也不说什么。

而苏宇，想了想，很快看向万天圣他们道：“那就在这，大家传送过去吧，我看这里空间稳固，波动不大，大概是空间古族耗费无数岁月，稳固了这里。”

裂空侯点点头：“这地方，我们稳固了很多年，在这传送，不会有动静的！而且第一次传送，通道内的空间之力波动很微弱，也很难被人感应到。”

说罢又道：“不过，传送过去了，想传送回来就难了……我们也是担心被人反向传送回来，所以都是单边传送！”

“单边传送？”苏宇微微凝眉。

裂空侯点头，很快又道：“不过若是带着传送门，那就是双向的！”

苏宇松了口气，这还不错。传送门，显然是核心部位。

“混沌山通道对面危险吗？”

“挺危险的，也是一座山，在山中洞穴中，但是在那待久了，就会被古兽感应到。”

裂空侯解释道：“到了地方，最好主动切断和大道的联系，那样的话，会更安全一些。”

显然，这些强者尽管没看到是因为什么，但是也知道，和大道排挤有些关系。

苏宇这边倒是不用担心，大明王可以制造屏蔽大阵。

苏宇看向万天圣几人，“那你们就直接传送过去，我就不去了，也不需要星宇印来镇压，第一次传送动静不大！你们传送过去了，打探清楚四周的情况，在那扎下根基！等到必要的时候，我会通过蓝天联系你们，随时给敌人背后一击！”

Wan Tiansheng spoke in a deep voice, "Be careful. Now that we've left, this place has become more dangerous with the emergence of some Heavenly Sovereigns..."

After a moment's thought, he added, "Why not... leave Fat Ball behind?"

He glanced at Fat Ball, who looked back at him with clear eyes.

Why are you calling me?

Wan Tiansheng chuckled and quickly said, "Fat Ball may only have the combat strength of a Heavenly King, but it possesses many treasures, especially that... that shoe. When it erupts, it might have the power of a Heavenly Sovereign!"

Lie Kong Marquis was taken aback. Heavenly Sovereign power? This dog?

She looked at Fat Ball, who humbly replied, "No way, Heavenly Sovereigns sound really powerful. I can't beat them! I'm just a dog, I can only bite, not fight, and I'm only at the Eternal level..."

Su Yu was speechless. Last time, you said the same thing. You claimed Daofuse was formidable and that you couldn't win! Then... then you hurried back to water the flowers and stomped the West Heavenly King to death with a shoe!

Heavenly Sovereign or Heavenly King, they're all Daofuse. Since no master of laws has appeared, the Daofuse realm has accumulated many experts of varying strengths. Can Fat Ball, using the Culture King's shoe, match a Heavenly Sovereign? That's hard to say! It's not easy for a Heavenly Sovereign to kill a Heavenly King. After all, there's no qualitative change yet!

Can Fat Ball fight a Heavenly Sovereign? It's unknown for now. Su Yu didn't expect to get any information from Fat Ball, because in Fat Ball's view, it's just a dog that can't beat anyone. Whether it can fight or not, it will find out when the time comes.

"Fat Ball, stay with them. The interior of Chaos Mountain is more dangerous. Moreover, if the Control King's lineage discovers us, I suspect they have experts who walk the Chaos Path, perhaps even reaching the level of Hundred Battle, or even beyond..."

Su Yu took a deep breath and said, "The Chaos Path can avoid the seal of the myriad paths. I know this, and the Control King's lineage, who cultivate the Chaos Path, should know it too! If I were them, no matter the cost, I would cultivate a Chaos Path expert to the level of a master of laws! So, I suspect this possibility exists. With Fat Ball here, there's some resistance!"

Fat Ball blinked, feeling overestimated. A master of laws! An ancient Human King! How could I resist? This new Human Lord really thinks too much. Forget it, no need to explain.

"Doubao and Flatbread will stay hidden in my Mark of Civilization," Su Yu said with a smile. "Lan Tian, Marquis Giant Bamboo, and I won't leave. We also have March and Doubao. Our strength is sufficient! I'll find Xia Longwu and the others soon. Don't worry, I'll bring them into the Mark of Civilization. They won't be in danger unless they reach Daofuse."

Wan Tiansheng spoke softly, "Be careful, and Lan Tian, protect Emperor Yu!"

Lan Tian grinned, "Don't worry!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded. Although Lan Tian wasn't very reliable, he could be counted on in critical moments.

"We're teleporting now!" the Great Zhou King said, considering if there was anything else to remind them of. After thinking for a moment, he added, "In the Land of Dao Source, if there are any hidden humans, I suggest helping them within your capabilities!"

He explained, "The old folks from the Hundred Battle era, except for Marquis Huoyun and the others, are likely dead! If anyone appears now, they might have been in slumber for a long time! These people are worth recruiting! Emperor Yu has the Starry Sky Seal and has inherited the pen dao of the Culture King, opening the Heaven Gate. Even if those old folks see it, they will support Emperor Yu... and won't have other thoughts, because they haven't experienced the Hundred Battle era!"

Su Yu nodded, "I'll see when the time comes. There might not be an opportunity, and besides, it's hard to say if there are any ancient humans in the Land of Dao Source!"

"Alright."

The Great Zhou King said no more. At this moment, the strong were ready to teleport. Heavendoom looked helpless. Ever since he came up, he had been running around without a single fight. Now they were heading to Chaos Mountain, and he still didn't have a separate array symbol to leave alone. Clearly, even at Chaos Mountain, he wouldn't have a chance to fight, making him feel even more lonely!

Meanwhile, Marquis Tongtian didn't mind these things. He smiled and said, "Emperor Yu, when I reach Chaos Mountain, I'll try to establish portals along the Space Ancient Beast Race's pathways. Then, when Emperor Yu controls these portals, I can locate them anytime..."

He continued with a smile, "If Emperor Yu has the chance in the future, just take me along. No need for these portals! These portals can serve as positioning points for others. At that time, with me, I can teleport Emperor Yu to any portal location!"

"......"

He wanted to show his value and, by the way, compete and show off his prowess as Marquis Tongtian!

Marquis Tongtian's words made Lie Kong Marquis's face change slightly, "You... Marquis Tongtian?"

Marquis Tongtian grinned, "Lie Kong Marquis, your Space Ancient Beast Race's teleportation is troublesome. So many portals, too troublesome! One portal is enough! Once I figure out your pathway system, I can go anywhere... In this myriad realms, where can't I open a portal? If Emperor Yu finds the Gate of Hell, I can even compete with that gate! When it comes to portals, I think I'm the best in the world... even the Gate of Hell can't take my first place!"

Opening a portal is nothing! I am the portal! And I'm a Daofuse-level portal, who am I afraid of?

Lie Kong Marquis said in a deep voice, "You actually came out!"

She was somewhat shocked, and after a while, she looked at Su Yu and said, "With this guy here, it can indeed save some trouble. Actually, back then, our race's emperor wanted to refine this guy into our race's space portal, but unfortunately... he was taken by the ancient imperial court!"

With some regret, "If our race controlled this portal, we could teleport anywhere in the heavens and earth! If the Human Lord thinks it's necessary, you can give Tongtian to me to refine. After refining, I might be able to traverse the lower realm..."

"......"

Marquis Tongtian's face turned green, and he angrily said, "Nonsense! Utter nonsense! Your Majesty must not listen to her slander! If she controls me, even a Heavenly Sovereign would find it hard to catch her. She will rebel sooner or later, yes, rebel!"

"......"

Lie Kong Marquis glanced at him and ignored him.

Marquis Tongtian snorted coldly, "Rest assured, Your Majesty, I will control all the pathways of this race sooner or later. By then, whether they are there or not, it doesn't matter! This race dares to bargain with Your Majesty, thinking they are extremely important, but they are nothing!"

"With me here, one person is worth a race!"

Lie Kong Marquis squinted her eyes and looked at him.

Marquis Tongtian was full of pride, "No need to explain, explaining is just covering up! I was personally conferred by the Culture King, able to connect heaven and earth, a marquis of the myriad realms, who is more noble than me?"

Lie Kong Marquis was speechless and didn't bother to respond. However, a slight sense of crisis arose in her heart. She had forgotten about Marquis Tongtian! Now that these space portals were handed over, once Marquis Tongtian controlled them and became familiar with the entire pathway system, he might really be able to teleport anywhere in the upper realm at will. By then, the importance of the Space Ancient Beast Race would indeed decrease significantly.

However, she couldn't say much at the moment.

Su Yu was also a bit surprised and delighted. He glanced at Marquis Tongtian and smiled, "Marquis Tongtian, don't talk nonsense..."

Marquis Tongtian quickly nodded, "Emperor Yu is right. Even if I'm happy, I must keep it to myself and not show it! It's necessary to restrain the Space lineage. Even if Emperor Yu doesn't say it, I understand. I will control everything well and help Emperor Yu restrain the entire Space lineage!"

"......"

Damn!

Su Yu cursed silently. Did I say that? Did I mean that? This guy talks too much! I never said such things; it's all your own imagination!

The others had strange expressions. Did Su Yu have such thoughts? Maybe... he did. After all, the Space Ancient Beast Race currently felt quite terrifying. The Great Zhou King could teleport people at will, becoming a treasure to restrain the myriad races, able to launch surprise attacks anytime. Even Daofuse experts didn't dare to leave. Now, the Space Ancient Beast Race was even scarier, having connected the upper realm system.

Could Su Yu not be wary at all? Now, with Marquis Tongtian's arrival, it did have some suppressive effect on the Space lineage.

Of course, Su Yu wouldn't admit it. At this moment, with a dark face, he coldly said, "If you can't speak properly, shut up! Enough nonsense, teleport!"

Marquis Tongtian wasn't angry. Everything was understood without words! I understand! Rest assured, watch my skills. As he left, he added, "Rest assured, Your Majesty, I'll take the time to sort out the entire upper realm teleportation system to prevent Lie Kong Marquis from secretly hiding some pathways... Rest assured, Your Majesty, with me here, I specialize in restraining them!"

"......"

With that, he quickly entered the huge portal, and a faint voice came, "Your Majesty need not worry. I know Your Majesty won't say it openly. It's all my own initiative. I understand this principle! I've been watching the portal for so many years, what don't I understand? This is called everything understood without words!"

"......"

Su Yu looked at Lie Kong Marquis, and after a while, awkwardly said, "I didn't say anything!"

I didn't say anything! Misunderstanding! Marquis Tongtian, you damn fool, would it kill you to say a few less words?

Lie Kong Marquis was also speechless and, after a long time, said, "It's fine."

But she was extremely depressed inside. Marquis Tongtian, you damn dog, I'll make you pay sooner or later! I haven't even joined the Human Race yet, and this damn dog is already giving me a hard time. I should have refined this portal back then!

At this moment, the others were entering the portal one after another. Lie Kong Marquis waved her hand, and a surge of spatial power flowed in. The space gate flickered for a while, and the teleportation began!

The teleportation power lasted for a while, and suddenly, a head popped out of the portal. Marquis Tongtian looked a bit sly, "Your Majesty, see, I said I could teleport freely. I've grasped some patterns. Look, I can shuttle back and forth. Your Majesty, call me anytime if you need anything!"

With that, his head disappeared!

Chapter 756: The Weight of Decisions

The Marquis of Rift Sky wore a grave expression, clenching her teeth for a long moment before spitting out, "Shameless!"

Su Yu looked at her with confusion. The Marquis of Rift Sky gritted her teeth and said, "He's stealing the marks our race left in the passage... He's trying to seize control of these teleportation channels!"

Su Yu's face changed slightly. "Scoundrel! Shameless! If he doesn't leave, I'll definitely deal with him. I'll call him back..."

"No need!"

The Marquis of Rift Sky sighed. "Forget it. Maybe he's right. Since our race has given up... handed it over to the Human Lord, then let him be!"

Her voice carried a hint of helplessness. Although she had relinquished control to Su Yu, the Space Ancient Clan could still use these channels. But now, the Marquis Tongtian was swiftly taking control of the spatial marks within these channels, erasing their influence over them. If this continued, even the Space Ancient Clan wouldn't be able to use the channels they had opened!

Su Yu's subordinates truly included all sorts of people. The Marquis of Rift Sky had completely forgotten about this until now. She suddenly remembered that Marquis Tongtian had been a nemesis of the teleportation path in the past. He controlled the entrances to the eighth layer. No matter how powerful the Space Ancient Clan was, even if they could teleport through any barrier, they still had to pass through his gate to reach the eighth layer! If he didn't let them in, even the ancient emperor of the Space Clan couldn't enter unless they forcibly broke through.

The Culture King had personally conferred the title of Marquis upon him back then. There were stronger individuals who hadn't received such a title, clearly valuing his abilities.

As for Su Yu, he was merely paying lip service. The Marquis of Rift Sky didn't need to guess; Su Yu was probably quite pleased with Marquis Tongtian's control over these channels.

Su Yu, however, maintained a stern expression, suppressing the joy in his heart. With a serious face, he said, "Rest assured, Marquis of Rift Sky. The next time I encounter that fellow, I will definitely punish him! This is simply outrageous!"

"......"

The Marquis of Rift Sky didn't want to speak further.

Su Yu coughed lightly, downplaying the matter quickly. He then turned his attention to the portals. "I'll take these portals with me, then. Thank you, Marquis of Rift Sky!"

"The Human Lord is too kind!"

Su Yu smiled, not saying much more, and swiftly collected all the portals.

Good stuff!

...

Moments later, Su Yu bid farewell to the Marquis of Rift Sky, feeling unburdened. He and Lantian quickly vanished into the void, leaving the territory of the Space Ancient Clan.

After they left, the Marquis of Rift Sky suddenly grabbed Kong Kong by the neck. In Kong Kong's panicked and helpless gaze, she squeezed his neck tightly, gritting her teeth. "Little one, you didn't tell me a lot of information! You didn't mention they have several quasi-kings, several top-tier Daofuse experts! You also didn't say that the chatterbox Marquis Tongtian is among them!"

"You didn't tell me that this new Human Lord is also at the quasi-king level!"

"You didn't mention that there might be a Heavenly Sovereign among them, that dog... why didn't you bring it up?"

"And you didn't say that Marquis Huoyun and the others have all pledged allegiance to him!"

"And..."

Kong Kong was on the verge of tears.

I don't know!

I really don't know!

I'm just an Eternal. We parted ways last time, and it's only been a few days. How could I know so much has happened?

Also, I'm quite grown up, not a little one.

Unfortunately, here, he was indeed a little one. At least in the eyes of the Marquis of Rift Sky, he was just a little one.

After venting her anger for a while, nearly strangling Kong Kong, the Marquis of Rift Sky finally sighed in defeat. "Forget it, I won't hold it against you. This new Human Lord has a talented group under him. Maybe he really can accomplish something!"

She patted Kong Kong and said after a long pause, "Work hard on your cultivation. You're still too weak! If our clan truly wants to pledge allegiance, it shouldn't be now... The old ones in the lower realm haven't achieved any great merits. Without any accomplishments, who would value or pay attention to you? Without a Heavenly Sovereign, even with many quasi-kings under his command, the Space Ancient Clan might be marginalized. What's the point of pledging allegiance then?"

The Marquis of Rift Sky's gaze turned profound. "Either make great contributions, so that even if you pledge allegiance, you can instantly become a pillar of strength! Otherwise... maintain the current situation, understand?"

"Understood!"

Kong Kong nodded, understanding the Marquis of Rift Sky's intentions. Indeed, with many strong individuals under Su Yu's command, the importance of the Space Ancient Clan wasn't that significant.

"So, what does the lord mean..."

"No need to ask more, just focus on your cultivation!"

The Marquis of Rift Sky didn't bother with him. Telling him was pointless, as he was just a weakling!

Kong Kong sighed. In these times, having no strength was truly pitiful!
