Chapter 698: The Path of All Beings Opens! (10,000 Words Update Requesting Subscription)

Three Madmen Pave the Way!

At this moment, Su Yu wielded a massive stone, advancing with unstoppable force.

"Suppress!"

His voice echoed continuously.

Times have changed. Just because our predecessors didn't dare or couldn't do it doesn't mean we can't!

Did the predecessors have someone as abnormal as Lantian?

Did they have so many avatars fall?

Su Yu realized that this path was difficult to tread!

Too difficult!

Each time, it was the true body that fell. Yes, the true body.

Every Lantian was himself.

Not fake.

If it were Su Yu, he could also use avatar techniques, but they would be useless. His avatars were merely simple copies.

In this era, the only one who might have hope of opening this Path of All Beings was probably Lantian.

Su Yu led the way, with Lantian following behind, his avatars continuously falling.

Yet, Lantian was all smiles.

"Brother Yu is truly amazing!"

"Much better than Brother Tian Sheng. Before, an avatar could only take a few steps, but now it goes so far. Brother Yu is incredible!"

"......"

Damn!

Su Yu cursed silently.

If it weren't for the fact that we're opening a path right now, do you believe you wouldn't see me anymore?

I just praised you a bit, and now you're getting cocky!

With a bit of helplessness, Su Yu didn't bother anymore. Soon, he laughed heartily, drowning out Lantian's words.

"Principal, let's see who can suppress longer and go further. It seems your human path isn't quite there yet!"

"Your human path isn't there!"

Wan Tiansheng was speechless. What nonsense was this?

Su Yu was also speechless. What was wrong?

Still not convinced!

I'm speaking the truth. You really aren't there yet. Mainly, your Human Lord Seal's suppression effect isn't as good as this small stone. Of course, Su Yu wouldn't say that.

At this moment, Su Yu was also advancing rapidly, flying forward.

The three of them cleared the River of Time, and the blood path spread!

Lantian's avatars continued to explode, but much slower now.

Gradually, Su Yu found it hard to sustain.

Suppressing was exhilarating.

Showing off was also exhilarating.

However, clearing the River of Time ultimately required strength, not just strength, but also a deep understanding of the great path.

All three of them were top-tier existences.

Yet, at this moment, Su Yu was actually feeling a bit powerless!

He forced himself to continue. Having just said Wan Tiansheng wasn't good, how could he not be good himself? He had to hold on.

As long as the understanding of the great path was deep, nothing was impossible.

Not only that, but at this moment, Su Yu thought of something. As he passed by certain places, there were tributaries. At this moment, in some of these tributaries, a page of a book appeared, and with a boom, it suddenly exploded, flattening the waves near the tributary!

Wan Tiansheng was dumbfounded.

What was this?

Ahead, Su Yu laughed loudly, "Those who gain the Dao have much help! Indeed, when I, Su Yu, pave the way, even the River of Time must make way for me!"

At this moment, Wan Tiansheng couldn't refute.

He didn't understand!

He didn't understand why, even though Su Yu hadn't suppressed that area yet, the waves had already dissipated.

Could it be... as Su Yu said?

When he paves the way, even the River of Time must give face?

What a big face you have!

Wan Tiansheng was somewhat skeptical, yet he couldn't figure out why the waves in the area ahead, which hadn't been reached yet, suddenly calmed down.

Su Yu also secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

The pages of the book smuggled into the tributary great paths were now playing a role, borrowing the power of myriad paths to stabilize the main path's fluctuations.

Although a single page couldn't borrow much power, the key was that Su Yu had buried many!

1,477 pages!

Each page could extinguish a wave, allowing everyone to advance a considerable distance.

Behind, some tributaries had Su Yu's buried pages, some didn't.

For those without, Su Yu could suppress them himself. For those with, the pages could borrow power to suppress.

In this way, it gave Su Yu a buffer period, no longer having to endure such immense pressure continuously.

At this time, the great paths of various races were actually fluctuating.

Some Eternals and Daofuse cultivators could vaguely sense it.

But it was useless!

Because at this moment, the entire myriad realms' great paths were fluctuating. Three madmen were opening a path on the main trunk, with blood-red lines spreading through the void. Even fools knew that the human race might be up to something.

At this moment, with the great path fluctuating, everyone could only endure.

...

Puff!

Su Yu, who had been enduring, finally couldn't hold back and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Behind, Lantian's avatars were also much weaker.

Not as strong as before.

How far had they gone?

He didn't know. Anyway, they had passed the pen dao, passed the human path, gone very far, and the blood-red thread was still spreading, yet it hadn't ended.

At this moment, both Wan Tiansheng and Su Yu had already surpassed their previous limits.

They had gone further than before on the River of Time.

Su Yu spat blood, and behind him, Wan Tiansheng quickly flew over, shouting, "I'll take over, you go recover!"

Su Yu quickly retreated.

Behind, Lantian laughed, "Both brothers are so amazing! Keep it up!"

Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng ignored him.

In reality, Lantian's consumption was even greater than theirs. Not to mention the number of avatars, he had already exploded seven or eight thousand!

At this moment, Lantian was also struggling to move forward!

The glow on the Hunting Heaven List was also gradually dimming.

Lantian looked at the Hunting Heaven List and chuckled, "This Ten Thousand Laws Record has the effect of covering the sky. Once it loses its power, the River of Time will actively reject me and won't let me open the path anymore! If my avatars all die, or if this record runs out of power, then this path-opening will fail!"

Lantian laughed cheerfully, "Gentlemen, from now on, let's walk and talk! Record everything I've learned, felt, and comprehended! If I fail, I hope there will be successors to inherit my legacy!"

Lantian's avatar exploded, and another appeared. Without changing his expression, he continued, "My name is Lantian, born in the 275th year of the Anping Calendar..."

"What a good day!"

Su Yu shouted, and Lantian giggled, "Annoying, let me finish!"

Alright, Su Yu instantly shut his mouth.

You're ruthless!

"Counting it up, I'm 78 years old this year. I joined the Great Xia Cultural Research Academy at 18. At that time, it was still under the leadership of the fifth-generation principal, Ye Batian."

"I was in the same era as Liu Wenyan and Hong Tan, a few years older than them."

"I experienced the most glorious period of the fifth generation, but unfortunately, I still couldn't escape death..."

"After the fifth generation died, I felt that cultivating in the academy, being a mere researcher, was like building a car behind closed doors, unable to save the world... I also had noble ideals."

Lantian smiled, "At that time, Tian Sheng wanted someone to infiltrate the myriad races, to infiltrate the Myriad Race Cult, so I chose to leave. During that period, I felt powerless. The more I understood the myriad races, the more desperate I became. I despaired at this era, why it was so humble! I despaired that the myriad races didn't destroy the human race only because the human race still had value..."

Lantian recounted his history, his everything, his past, his life.

Including some of his turning points.

Why did he make such choices?

Because he saw no hope!

The more he understood the myriad races, the more desperate he became.

What was Eternal?

There were too many myriad races!

The dozens of Eternals of the human race were not enough to save the human race, so in despair, he chose a path he had previously wanted to take but didn't dare to.

I want to have countless avatars!

To defeat the myriad races, I must deeply understand them. I am Lantian, and I am also the myriad races.

Initially, he only wanted to study the weaknesses of the myriad races, but he always felt a barrier. Even with avatars, he couldn't truly use them as real people.

"Later, I felt this wouldn't work!"

"So, I chose to go further. I completely transformed my avatars. I cut my sea of will, and I didn't die!"

Lantian laughed brightly, but Su Yu felt a chill.

Cutting the sea of will!

And not dying?

This guy was truly a monster!

Lantian laughed, "The first time I tried cutting my sea of will, it hurt, it was too painful! I thought I was going to die, but later I found out I didn't die! Why didn't I die? This needs to be recorded clearly. It's willpower, it's spirit, it's a kind of persistence and recognition!"

Lantian said seriously, "Recognition! The first time I cut my sea of will, it was to transform into a demon race, so at that time, I firmly believed I was a demon race! I knew everything about the demon race, even my body structure was that of a demon race, everything about me was a demon race, so the sea of will I cut was a true demon race!"

Su Yu pondered, and ahead, Wan Tiansheng coughed blood, "Willpower and spirit are important, but cutting the sea of will should inevitably lead to the collapse of both seas of will. No matter how strong the willpower, it should collapse. Why didn't yours collapse?"

"Idiot!"

Lantian smiled charmingly, "Anything is possible! Just because you can't do it doesn't mean we can't! Brother Yu can try cutting his sea of will, cutting it in half, and then quickly repairing it. As long as you have a strong enough repairing character, there's a good chance..."

Saying this, he coquettishly added, "Tian Sheng is really stupid. You can actually try it too. You have a copying character. Although it's not powerful, you can try cutting half, then copying half, and then half real, half fake, trying to merge! As long as you get through the first hurdle, just wait for the slow fusion, and the fake can become real!"

Wan Tiansheng's heart moved slightly, and suddenly, he laughed, "Makes sense!"

After saying that, he quickly said, "How many avatars do you have left?"

"Over a thousand."

Wan Tiansheng frowned, then quickly said, "No problem, you continue cutting your sea of will to create avatars. I'll help you copy avatars and try. If it doesn't work, then as you said, half real, half fake!"

He was worried the avatars wouldn't be enough!

In reality, they probably wouldn't be enough. Up to now, there was no hope of successfully opening the path, and Lantian's avatars had already died seven or eight thousand!

Behind, Su Yu's eyes also moved slightly, "This is feasible. The principal is responsible for copying, increasing the number of avatars! I'll be responsible for strengthening his avatars, healing his avatars!"

After saying that, Su Yu shouted, and a character exploded, "Heal!"

Heal!

Lantian's damaged avatar suddenly healed a bit, and Su Yu was delighted. He almost forgot, we are civilized masters!

I know many characters!

I know many powers of the great path!

Why must we endure it head-on?

In the midst of the chaotic battlefield, Wan Tiansheng unleashed the power of his character, creating a clone of Lantian. The clone appeared almost real, but Lantian quickly frowned and said, "This won't do. Don't replicate my entire being! If my clone is injured, just replicate an arm or a leg. That way, we can delay the injuries and the explosion."

"Alright," Wan Tiansheng nodded, feeling somewhat optimistic. Both Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng knew that this was akin to drinking poison to quench thirst. The power of their characters was draining their strength, and they were already struggling to hold back the massive waves. Now, they had to help Lantian restore his clone's power, making their task even more difficult. Yet, no one mentioned this. At least, they hoped to see a glimmer of success, a chance that the path they were forging could succeed. This path was incredibly arduous.

Restoration and replication continued. Wan Tiansheng was reaching his limit, coughing up blood incessantly. Behind him, Lantian smiled, though the time before his clone's explosion was shortening. The blood-red path he walked grew longer and longer.

"Tiansheng, you should leave!" Lantian said with a smile. "Really, go! I've said all I needed to say. I want to try this myself. I want to see if this path can truly be opened."

Lantian's smile was radiant. "You've done your best. From ancient times to now, no one has ever had two top-tier experts paving the way for them. I've lived a life of madness and brilliance. To have the Human Emperor and the Human Lord of this era personally pave the way for me... it's an honor!"

At this moment, he seemed normal. Wan Tiansheng smiled, his blood staining his clothes. "You want to see, and so do I. Can this path succeed?"

Behind them, Su Yu soared into the sky, wielding a massive stone to suppress the giant waves. He said calmly, "Alright, let's keep moving! We're not at the point of no return yet!"

"I'm afraid... you won't be able to return!" Lantian sighed softly. They had ventured too far. If these two didn't reserve some strength, they might not make it back.

"I've been too willful. If Tiansheng accompanies me... then let him. But Su Yu, you must return!" Lantian said bitterly, "If he dies here, it won't affect the overall situation. But if you die here... all our previous efforts will be in vain!"

Su Yu couldn't die here!

Wan Tiansheng also spoke solemnly, "Go back!"

If Su Yu continued, he might not have the strength to return. Once lost in the River of Time, even if he didn't die, he might be swept into a tributary and sealed, never to return.

Su Yu snorted coldly, "Underestimating me?"

With that, Su Yu shouted, "Come forth!"

Boom!

At that moment, the Book of Time in his mind fluctuated, unleashing a formidable power that swept forward, clearing the path. Su Yu's face turned pale, and a strand of white hair appeared among his long locks.

"Time is with me, the cosmos and space, heaven and earth unite!"

Characters emerged, and I controlled time!

Above was the cosmos, below was eternity.

The four corners of the world, all belong to me!

The Book of Time trembled slightly, and strands of white hair appeared on Su Yu's head. In this moment, Su Yu was incredibly powerful and cold. "What are you looking at? You think I'm like you, with no means at all?"

"You..."

Wan Tiansheng frowned, "Are you throwing your life away? Lantian isn't worth it!"

Lantian rolled his eyes at him and looked at Su Yu with bitterness. "He's right, I'm not worth it!"

"Foolishness!" Su Yu sneered, "Though you two are older than me, you're foolish! In three to five years, the Upper Realm will open! What does eternal life matter? If I lose, I won't live without dignity, without hope! If I lose, I'll die, living only to 25! So what? In my life, who can compare?"

He was burning his lifespan!

So what?

Su Yu didn't care!

Using the Book of Time, he was still lacking. Every use consumed his lifespan.

No problem!

With Su Yu's strength, living for 100,000 years would be easy.

Many ancient relics were still alive.

Either I live less than 25 years, or... I defeat the myriad races and become the overlord of the heavens. Then, I can slowly recover!

The future?

Who knows what the next 100,000 years will bring!

I only look at the present, not the future. I only know that if Lantian succeeds, the Human Race will gain a top-tier Daofuse, perhaps even a Heavenly King, or stronger!

"Move!"

Su Yu held a stone in his left hand and the faintly visible Book of Time in his right, shouting, "What are you standing there for?"

Wan Tiansheng's expression changed, and Lantian sighed before quickly smiling, "Lantian... thanks you!"

He stepped forward, leaving a long trail of blood.

At this moment, Lantian was no longer flamboyant or disgusting, only resolute. I must succeed!

An emperor paved the way for him.

Burned his lifespan for him!

If I don't succeed, how can this world be worthy of me?

As they moved, the Book of Time fluctuated, calming the waves. More strands of white hair appeared on Su Yu's head.

White clothes, white hair.

At this moment, in Wan Tiansheng's eyes, Su Yu no longer had the immaturity of the past. Wan Tiansheng felt bitter. This guy... always surprises me.

I can never predict what he'll do!

Suppression!

Constant suppression.

The huge waves were suppressed, the tributaries were suppressed, and Su Yu's aura grew stronger and colder. His white hair fluttered. How much of my lifespan can you burn?

Can I live to 25?

If so, I'm not afraid!

If not, then we'll see.

At that moment, a tributary of the Great Dao appeared before Su Yu. He hadn't paid attention initially, but suddenly, a figure appeared on that tributary. In such a deep place, there was actually a figure!

That figure was also shocked!

"No... Su Yu... impossible..."

Martial Emperor!

Su Yu's heart trembled.

He quickly looked over. It was a powerful Great Dao. If the pen dao was five or six thousand meters wide, and the Wild Beast Dao was two or three thousand meters, this Dao was stronger than the Wild Beast Dao!

The Martial Emperor was stronger than the Wild Beast!

At least close to 4,000 meters wide, from Su Yu's perspective.

This was the strongest Dao Su Yu had seen so far, after the Death Dao, the Physical Dao, and the Pen Dao. The Five Elemental Dao and the Wild Beast Dao were inferior, and Wan Tiansheng had just begun his path.

"You can't possibly have come this far..."

The Martial Emperor was shocked. This was his domain!

The next moment, he roared, "You think you can, but you can't!"

Boom!

At that moment, a massive seal erupted, shattering his shadow instantly. It was a powerful seal, the Sanctification Seal!

This was the first time Su Yu used the Sanctification Seal with full force!

With one strike, a crack appeared on the Sanctification Seal.

The Martial Emperor's shadow shattered instantly.

Su Yu coldly looked ahead, the Martial Emperor's voice disappearing.

"Annoying!"

Su Yu coldly shouted, and the next moment, the small stone smashed toward that Great Dao. The Book of Time fluctuated, striking the tributary into chaos. Su Yu shouted angrily, "Dare to block my path, Martial Emperor, even if you're unsealed, I'll kill you! Don't provoke me!"

The Martial Emperor actually wanted to block the path!

Su Yu was furious, also intimidating the Martial Emperor. He wasn't unsealed, not yet the master of rules.

Believe it or not, I'll pay the price to damage your Great Dao!

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's voice disappeared.

...

Luminous Domain Mansion.

The Martial Emperor suddenly opened his eyes, spitting out blood like lava.

The Martial Emperor's face was grim, quickly turning heavy.

This guy, so decisive!

Not only that, but also so... domineering!

He had merely spoken casually upon seeing him, and this bastard had smashed down a seal without giving him time to react!

"These guys actually made it here..."

The Martial Emperor was still shocked, truly shaken.

He seemed to sense something. Su Yu... seemed to be burning his lifespan, his hair already white. Was that guy throwing his life away?

Su Yu was much stronger than the last time he saw him!

He even seemed to be advancing toward top-tier Daofuse.

"Just betting on this one chance?"

The Martial Emperor's heart was endlessly shaken, just betting on this one opportunity!

Su Yu, with his extraordinary talent, traversing the myriad realms, didn't seek the future, only willing to bet once. If he lost, it would be over. If he won, he didn't care about his lifespan!

"Why?"

The Martial Emperor murmured, why!

With Su Yu's talent, even if he lost this time, he could completely escape like Hundred Battle, or hide, not necessarily dying!

Endure for hundreds or thousands of years, Su Yu would surely become the master of rules!

What was he thinking?

At this moment, the Martial Emperor suddenly didn't understand, couldn't accept it, because Su Yu wasn't a small bug. He was a peerless genius who opened the Heaven Gate. The Martial Emperor almost never called Su Yu a small bug now, unless extremely angry.

Because, in the Martial Emperor's view, only Su Yu in this era could compare with himself.

"What are you pursuing?"

The Martial Emperor muttered, suddenly calming down, with a thoughtful look, a confused look. What was Su Yu pursuing, he didn't know.

Then what... was he pursuing?

Revenge?

Or something else?

"Three people, Su Yu is paving the way for someone, another is opening the path, it's that Lantian... someone who resonated with me in the past, what path is he opening?"

The Martial Emperor's heart shook again.

As for Wan Tiansheng, someone who could reach near his Great Dao, no matter what, was a peerless figure. This tide actually produced so many monsters.

"Is a great era descending?"

The ancient times were a great era!

Is this era going to produce someone like the Culture King?

At this moment, the Martial Emperor's emotions were too complex.

Even though Su Yu's seal had caused his Great Dao to fluctuate, making it harder to unseal, he didn't care.

He didn't appear again to intercept them.

He also wanted to see... where they were going!

Madness!

Year 350 of the Anping Calendar.

Deep within the River of Time, danger lurked at every turn. 

"Su Yu, with your unparalleled talent, why risk your life here as a protector? If you perish in this river, would you not be wasting your extraordinary gifts?"

...

"Who was that just now?"

"The Martial Emperor?"

In the River of Time, Wan Tiansheng was equally astounded.

Su Yu chuckled, "It was him! A man with talent but no wisdom! He doesn't understand what the Dao is, what pursuit is, what dreams are, or what he truly desires!"

Su Yu sneered, "He who opened the Heaven Gate, preceding even the Culture King and others! Yet, his power of the Dao is only slightly stronger than that of a foolish Desolate Beast. Such a human, a brute, a mere warrior!"

Wan Tiansheng nodded, "To have opened the Heaven Gate and yet be sealed away, indeed... a bit weak! In my view, opening the Heaven Gate signifies supreme talent, an understanding of the Dao at a glance. Such an existence should at least reach the level of the Four Heavenly Kings, or it's a disgrace!"

Lan Tian also sighed, "It's somewhat regrettable. I once visited the Luminous Domain Mansion and felt that this person was quite powerful. But now... compared to the geniuses of his era, he falls short! Opening the Heaven Gate, he should not lag far behind the Culture King and others, even if he doesn't surpass them."

The three shook their heads simultaneously, disdainful, "A brute, a mere warrior!"

They were dismissive!

Truly, talent without the ability to wield it was a lamentable thing.

The three continued forward, leaving the matter of the Martial Emperor behind. There was no point in discussing him further; he had failed to block their path and was sent flying by Su Yu's strike. Talking more about him would be a waste of energy.

However, Su Yu had gained some understanding.

The Martial Emperor's Dao was here.

The pen dao and human dao were ahead, suggesting that the depth of a Dao wasn't necessarily better. Perhaps because the Martial Emperor was still alive, his Dao extended further. The pen dao, being unclaimed, might have drifted.

He didn't quite understand, but it didn't matter.

It was a pity that his Mark of Civilization had no pages left. Otherwise, during the moment the Martial Emperor was struck, he might have been able to sneak a page in. But then again, the Martial Emperor was alive and might have noticed.

No regrets!

At this moment, Su Yu was clad entirely in white.

White clothes, white hair, white eyebrows.

Yet, he remained as youthful as ever, his appearance unchanged, now exuding an even more dashing and elegant aura.

The Book of Time continued to ripple, and the three pressed on.

Their lifespans continued to burn—thousands of years, tens of thousands, twenty thousand years...

Su Yu felt he could live for a hundred thousand years!

This was just the beginning!

Burn, keep burning!

Behind them, the blood path now spanned the myriad realms.

It stretched into the endless void!

...

The River of Time knew not the passage of years.

After an indeterminate period, Su Yu suddenly halted. Behind him, Wan Tiansheng's aura was weak, and Lan Tian's avatars had exploded by the thousands. The Hunting Heaven List had dimmed completely.

Lan Tian, feeling a sense of loss, chuckled, "This time, let's head back! I've seen sights I never imagined! No regrets in this life! Thank you, my fellow Daoists, for seeking the Dao with me!"

Daoists!

Companions on the same path.

In this world, the hardest to find were companions on the same path. You and I share the same Dao, so my path is not lonely.

The three had traveled tens of thousands of miles, traversing time and space.

The Emperor Yu had expended tens of thousands of years of lifespan for him, and the Holy King had suffered countless injuries... it was enough.

If they continued, none of the three would return!

Su Yu also felt a sense of loss. I... have done my best!

This path, I cannot see its end.

I truly have done my best!

At this moment, if Lan Tian did not succeed in opening the path, he would be ruined. Thousands of avatars exhausted in one moment, countless seas of will transformed into a blood path, spreading through the River of Time. Even if he returned, he would be a cripple.

This path is difficult, as hard as ascending to the heavens!

Fail and you die!

Wan Tiansheng, swaying, also bore a look of finality, having failed.

We cannot see the end of the Dao.

"Where is the end of the Dao?"

Su Yu shouted, filled with unwillingness!

We have opened the path for tens of thousands of miles, yet no path can be so difficult to prove!

Can anyone prove this path?

Two peerless Daofuse experts, using the Book of Time, the Hunting Heaven List, and the small stone, protected a Sunmoon Realm expert for tens of thousands of miles, yet they still couldn't see the end. In this world, can anyone open this path?

Even the Lord of Rules can't!

Their understanding of the Dao may not be as profound as the three of them, focused on one path. Being the Lord of Rules doesn't mean you can protect the Dao.

The three were such prodigies, walking myriad paths, yet they couldn't help one person open the path!

Unwilling!

Lan Tian laughed, "Let's go back! I have seen and heard this path, and I can die without regret. It's enough, I have no regrets. I must thank this path for leaving me without regrets!"

He had no regrets!

Just a bit of sadness, not seeing the end, having cost two peerless experts a significant portion of their lifespan, Su Yu having paid a great price, and in the end, still ending in failure.

Ahead, Su Yu's long hair fluttered, filled with anger and unwillingness.

Ultimately, it turned into a sigh, unable to continue!

If he continued, he would die.

"Sorry!"

Su Yu sighed, not daring to look back. I was so confident, full of conviction, bringing them onto this path, and now, only two can return.

Lan Tian laughed, "Are you saying this to me? You really are... leaving one speechless!"

"Let's go!"

He chuckled, "I'll keep walking, I still have three avatars, I'll continue with the three bodies, to see more beautiful scenery! This journey, I've gained much insight, thank you both!"

Accompanying a friend for a thousand miles, a farewell is inevitable!

One cannot be willful!

Su Yu felt incredibly bitter, I must leave.

Wan Tiansheng also silently watched Lan Tian continue forward, his avatars gradually collapsing, his eyes filled with loss and sadness.

Another of my Daoist friends is gone.

Coming with full confidence, now only filled with sorrow.

Seven emotions and six desires, I am ultimately not immune.

No sadness, no injury, that is a saint, I am not, I am Wan Tiansheng, not a saint.

"I only wish you have another life, and I will guide you again..."

Wan Tiansheng murmured, guiding you onto this path, I will send you again, I believe, you will continue, to see more beautiful scenery!

"This life is without regret!"

Ahead, an avatar collapsed, Lan Tian's second avatar emerged, smiling, with his back to Su Yu and the others, "Go back, when the heavens and earth change, don't forget, in the depths of the River of Time, there is still a Daoist friend of yours!"

Su Yu watched him, step by step surpassing himself, continuing forward, the second avatar beginning to collapse, feeling a bit of sorrow.

Damn!

Why can't it be?

This path, why can't it be opened!

Must it reach the end of the river?

That's impossible!

The Human Emperor and others might be at that end, how could I possibly take Lan Tian to that end!

"This is a dead end, a path no one can open..."

Su Yu sighed in his heart.

The next moment, he looked ahead, vaguely seeing some Daos, perhaps the Daos of peerless experts, but unfortunately, Su Yu had no interest now.

Ahead, he vaguely saw some darkness.

Su Yu couldn't see where the end was.

He just watched, silently watched, watched with open eyes, as Lan Tian's second avatar began to collapse, the third avatar emerged, and with its collapse, there would be no more Lan Tian in the world.

Death aura began to seep from Lan Tian's body.

He was about to die!

Su Yu felt a bit of sorrow, the death aura was already coming out...

The death aura was already coming out?

Death aura!

Boom!

Like being struck by lightning!

Death aura?

Damn!

This is the River of Time, where did the death aura come from!

Don't joke!

The Death Dao and the River of Time are not the same!

Where did the death aura come from!

Su Yu's scalp tingled, recalling what the South King had said before, myriad changes do not depart from their origin!

The Death Dao, guiding the dead experts...

At this moment, it seemed to be guiding Lan Tian.

But how could death aura suddenly appear here?

Impossible!

At this moment, Su Yu roared, "Wait! I'm coming!"

With a loud shout, Su Yu rushed forward, Wan Tiansheng was startled, Lan Tian also turned his head, shouting, "Don't!"

"Idiot, death aura!"

Su Yu roared, death aura!

He thought of something, frantically, "Born from death! Yes, born from death! Ahead is a tributary of the Death Dao, there must be, no, not a tributary, it's the Death Dao! The Death Dao must intersect with the River of Time ahead!"

There must be!

He knew how the Death Dao was opened, the master of the Death Dao was also stealing the power of the River of Time.

This has nothing to do with Su Yu!

Su Yu only knew, perhaps there was hope.

He quickly flew forward, the Book of Time rippling again, shouting, "Don't fear the consumption, we'll return via the Death Dao, it's much easier than coming! Principal Wan, come quickly!"

"Lan Tian, do you have a death avatar?"

"No..."

"Create one immediately!"

Su Yu shouted, "Life and death as one, born from death, you lack the Death Dao in your myriad paths! Your path is not complete, even if you walk it for a lifetime, your path of all living beings may never be opened!"

Missing something!

The Death Dao!

Lan Tian was momentarily dazed, my path, still lacking!

Lacking the Death Dao!

At this moment, he seemed to understand, and behind, Wan Tiansheng was also frantic, overjoyed, "Quick, quickly create a death avatar, go ahead, find the River of Death!"

He and Su Yu, disregarding everything, had previously held back, preparing to return.

Now, they didn't care.

Frantically bombarding ahead, suppressing the giant waves!

The waves were monstrous!

Su Yu's hair was snow-white, the Death Dao was not far, definitely not far, otherwise, death aura couldn't have emerged from Lan Tian.

Forcing their way forward, the next moment, Su Yu was incredibly surprised.

He sensed it!

He sensed the seed of the death page!

He truly sensed it, in this region of the River of Time, in this place where the Death Dao shouldn't appear, he found the Death Dao, it was too incredible!

Su Yu rushed forward, quickly, he saw it!

Nothing, blank!

Anyone looking would see nothing, even with the Heaven Gate open, Su Yu didn't see it, but he sensed it.

The master of the Death Dao, too terrifying.

Where did he open the Death Dao?

Why can't I see it?

But I can sense its existence!

The next moment, Su Yu's eyes shone brightly, suddenly, a stone was thrown into the river, monstrous waves rolled, but Su Yu was incredibly ecstatic.

"Madman, this guy is also a madman, he opened a passage at the bottom of the River of Time, damn, no wonder I couldn't see it!"

The tributaries were all on the sides.

Chapter 715: The Path of Life and Death

There was no one else who would dare to carve a path directly beneath the riverbed!

The master of the Necro Path... Su Yu was impressed. Such a bold and ingenious idea. It was hidden, secure, and undetectable by anyone. It could even siphon power without anyone noticing! No wonder the Necro Path was so formidable!

This madman had punched a hole in the River of Time itself. You couldn't help but be impressed!

With Su Yu's relentless bombardment, a hole gradually appeared at the riverbed. At this moment, Lantian and Wan Tiansheng also arrived. Both sensed the presence of death energy. As Su Yu broke through the river, revealing the hole, they felt it clearly. Death energy suddenly surged from Lantian's body.

Gradually, Lantian seemed to comprehend something and suddenly laughed.

"I... I have sensed the Path of the Necro!"

"So that's how it is... To be reborn from death, so that's how it is!"

Gradually, his last avatar suddenly began to transform into a necro. Lantian laughed heartily, "I... I see hope, I see this new world!"

"Hahaha!"

At this moment, all three of them laughed madly! There is always a way out!

In their most desperate moment, they saw a glimmer of life, a glimmer of hope.

Boom!

Lantian's avatar instantly transformed into a necro, death energy overflowing and impacting the heavens and earth.

Simultaneously, behind them, the blood path suddenly intertwined with life and death!

The originally dim blood path suddenly flickered with beams of light!

These beams of light reflected throughout the River of Time!

Rumble!

Countless powers of laws swept in, and behind them, on that blood path, suddenly, one Lantian after another appeared.

The previously exploded Lantians reappeared on the blood path.

They spread to the end of the river!

Countless Lantians were laughing madly.

"Life and death... Yin and yang... Myriad paths... All beings!"

"The Path of All Beings!"

How could all beings exist without necros!

I was too narrow-minded!

At this moment, countless Lantians laughed wildly, "My necro darlings, I love you, Daddy loves you! You too are all beings! Hahaha!"

With madness and joy, Lantian's avatars rapidly merged, coming together.

The Path of All Beings was complete!

Rumble!

Each time a Lantian merged, his aura grew stronger, starting from the entrance and merging one by one, Infinite Strength, Skysoar, Lingyun, Shanhai, Sunmoon...

Gradually, it reached the Eternal!

Eternal Stage One, Stage Two, Stage Three...

The aura gradually strengthened.

Countless Lantians began to unite, Stage Seven, Stage Eight, Stage Nine!

By the time Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng saw a powerful Lantian approaching, he already had the aura of Daofuse!

And yet, he hadn't merged all his avatars.

The powerful avatars continued along the blood path, merging more avatars.

The aura continued to strengthen at the Daofuse level.

Lantian laughed wildly!

"My little darlings, you're all back!"

"Love you to death!"

"Hehehe, Tiansheng darling, love you to death!"

"Giggle, Emperor Yu, from now on, I like you, not Tiansheng darling anymore..."

Rumble!

The aura grew stronger and stronger, and when the last necro avatar fused, with a thunderous boom, Su Yu and Wan Tiansheng were both forced back a few steps by the overwhelming aura!

Su Yu was stunned, and Wan Tiansheng was also shocked.

The next moment, the two exchanged glances, and suddenly, they cursed madly, "Damn! Is this peak or Heavenly King?"

Unbelievable!

Damn!

It shouldn't be like this, this bastard seems to have surpassed us, it's infuriating!

"Hahaha!"

"Shut up!"

"Hahahahahaha!"

Lantian laughed wildly, his laughter shaking the heavens and earth. I succeeded!

Too excited!

The path is complete, the Path of All Beings!

...

At this moment, at the end of the River of Time, a massive wave surged, sweeping deeper into the river!

The last time Wan Tiansheng carved a path, there were faint ripples, and those giant pillars of light appeared. Today, they reappeared, and a shadow suddenly looked back, exclaiming in shock, "Damn!"

What was happening?

Was a master of laws emerging?

A single master of laws wasn't much, but... the terrifying thing wasn't the emergence of a master of laws, it was that there wasn't a master of laws emerging!

What... what was happening?

At this moment, the shadow rippled, somewhat incredulous!
